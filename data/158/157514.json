Established as one of Virgin Classics’ bestselling artists, Jaroussky, now aged 34, has been honoured three times in the Victoires de la Musique awards in his native France and has also received Germany’s most prominent music prize, the Echo Klassik. His diverse achievements are saluted in two new collections on Virgin Classics – the 2CD set “The Voice” and the DVD and Blu Ray “La Voix des rêves: Greatest moments in Concert”.","popularity":0.2184,"poster_path":"/ykA2O3a3rS4FUXaRnoGKoc6nqCA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philippe Jaroussky: Greatest Moments in Concert (La voix des rêves)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jaroussky","original_name":"Philippe Jaroussky","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/7xgiiRWKSqS05p7RtbOc4y0SVzP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bc89251416c910e5745","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Nicole Lemieux","original_name":"Marie-Nicole Lemieux","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/z2pBMRwfJ9ww7SpolJxaFkjn8oK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4bc89251416c910e5749","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuria Rial","original_name":"Nuria Rial","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4bc89251416c910e574d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jérôme Ducros","original_name":"Jérôme Ducros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bc89251416c910e5751","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gautier Capuçon","original_name":"Gautier Capuçon","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/etJzJq7mWe8MgcaND5rTvzkgXUt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bc89251416c910e5755","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jaroussky","original_name":"Philippe Jaroussky","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/7xgiiRWKSqS05p7RtbOc4y0SVzP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bc89251416c910e575b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Vivaldi","original_name":"Antonio Vivaldi","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/mDgLWGnbOlnBd1uSsfvoZMU0aI9.jpg","credit_id":"67771db925e0e91c57748950","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jules Massenet","original_name":"Jules Massenet","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/fMB6VUi0gIcQEu3WBoP7G8rQMCD.jpg","credit_id":"67771dce816b2810d1667b39","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","original_name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/7vbMm0VcHE0vTlaU9BTLqILenM0.jpg","credit_id":"67771ddc816b2810d1667b3e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vk4t3f69uo9hwAnSqEE45TFHsiO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/ykA2O3a3rS4FUXaRnoGKoc6nqCA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
