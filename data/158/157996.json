Founded in the 1960s, it was once the largest cinema in Palestine, today it stands as a hollow echo of its society. Re-building the cinema, Germans and Palestinians come together evoking often comedic but always political and cultural ramifacations. Cinema Jenin witnessed an intimate, nuanced and textured view into the city and its domestic affairs as well as the journey of a dedicated, loyal, often conflicted group of people who hope that the re-building of the cinema will be a bridge to peace, freedom and Palestinian self-empowerment.","popularity":0.0869,"poster_path":"/9fL0V6JEk9jBXxhHpT538OynuF3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of a dream","title":"Cinema Jenin","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aleksei Bakri","original_name":"Aleksei Bakri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bd89251416c910e77d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Vetter","original_name":"Marcus Vetter","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bd89251416c910e77d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2179140","wikidata_id":"Q19839659","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":1332,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fL0V6JEk9jBXxhHpT538OynuF3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":980}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
