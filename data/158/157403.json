In the 11th-century epic La Chanson de Roland, he is depicted as a key figure in halting the advance of the Arabs into France. In this story, the 10th-century legend is staged by a group of 12th-century pilgrims using the 11th-century poem. Their acting is interrupted by a violent peasant uprising, which kills many of the pilgrims. However, one of the survivors, is converted to the peasant cause and later speaks out in favor of more just treatment for the downtrodden.","popularity":1.0813,"poster_path":"/47GVEYxhfuFS9dPqSQkWAUUdxTk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Z
