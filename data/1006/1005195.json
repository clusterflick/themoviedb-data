She has uniforms made and hires a veteran of the Spanish-American War to teach her \"cadets\" military routines and drills. Her father owns a munitions factory and is always telling her to be on the lookout for spies. She convinces herself that the family butler, Williams, is a spy because he cuts his grapefruit in an odd way. It turns out that Williams isn't a spy but the people whom Dorothy least suspects are in fact spies, and they discover that Dorothy knows the password to get into the factory after hours.","popularity":0.25,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Country First","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Martin","original_name":"Vivian Martin","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/wtuYbYrRgqLbuyqFyrR4QmsKu7a.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dorothy Grant","credit_id":"62e136ffaa659e0050fca054","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cossar","original_name":"John Cossar","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/eSNYJl4CY2nJkRO3VXY5V5hlQ3e.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Franklin Grant","credit_id":"62e13714021cee00500b465d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Oberle","original_name":"Florence Oberle","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Grant","credit_id":"62e13726a44d0907dc171eab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
