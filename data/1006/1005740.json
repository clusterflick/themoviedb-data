Why are there only 2? Or maybe there is more?\r Is it a serial killer or is it something much bigger?\r Will Maxim succeed in the investigation in which someone from the police is obviously involved?\r Is it about revenge against Maxim, or is Frosina Krsteva an accidental target of the killer?\r Is the mafia involved, or is someone setting it up on purpose to stop Maxim from investigating?\r All are suspicious, some are suspects, and only one is a murderer. Or maybe not one killer?\r Lots of tension, adrenaline, drama, action and suspense until the final answer to the question: \"Who and why killed Frosina, the first victim\"?\r Or maybe... She's not the first?","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Најголемата вистина","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
