We are in Umbria, in the center of the Italian peninsula. A child runs through the green landscape, with a strip of sky on his head. Its run becomes a bird's eye view and we have the opportunity to visit the landscape from above until a dip makes us plunge into the gray of the urban, in the abandoned factories, the steel mill stands behind the vegetation and the now grown child will always seek to return to the green, becoming a landscape himself.","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":"/38nA2XFdHrZGKBcUOOmqh3q1DnM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 Themes for the Peri-Urban Landscape in Umbria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giada Fuccelli","original_name":"Giada Fuccelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638d76be7d5db5101e5660ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/38nA2XFdHrZGKBcUOOmqh3q1DnM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
