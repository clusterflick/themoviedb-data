Carter is betrayed by a comrade and is sentenced to be shot. He takes a desperate chance and escapes on board a vessel bound for London. In Paris Marston is stabbed by a model because he does not return her love. The wound incapacitates him from painting, and leaves an ugly scar, and he goes to America on a vacation. Highwaymen attack him, inflicting injuries which cause a total loss of memory. The robbers leave nothing in his pockets but the key to his Paris studio, and Marston adopts the name of Robert Anglo-Saxon.","popularity":0.1295,"poster_path":"/b0oREKL3W63KWa1AJPv03KMTm3B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Favorite Players Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A strong, stirring and absorbing story of mangled pathos, comedy and sensationalism with thrilling series at the race track, from the pen of RICHARD HARDING DAVIS and others.","title":"The Key to Yesterday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlyle Blackwell","original_name":"Carlyle Blackwell","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/rVXhwWrYMW1bwxobOAP0ZXG1Zby.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frederick Marston / Robert Anglo-Saxon","credit_id":"62e2ab1eafe22400670451da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2356822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Mayo","original_name":"Edna Mayo","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/gmBMCu3q5nzRU1Ad4eJv7KBjWz4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Duska Filson","credit_id":"62e2ab2eafe224004fa25192","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gypsy Abbott","original_name":"Gypsy Abbott","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Marston","credit_id":"62e2ab3dafe224004fa25197","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3640673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Brunton","original_name":"George Brunton","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"St. John","credit_id":"62e2ab50aa659e004df8009d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Francis Dillon","original_name":"John Francis Dillon","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/8WWebUUEfcpcTvUNhFAeeoPRQbR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rodman","credit_id":"62e2ab6148138218babc572f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3640674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Prescott","original_name":"Jack Prescott","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Se√±or Roberto","credit_id":"62e2ab7047c9fb016aa8a615","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sheehan","original_name":"John Sheehan","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/kyztLs4mUpmWeuVQUWm82mEp0ls.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"George Steels","credit_id":"62e2ab81e18e3f0279432e15","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1906522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ollie Kirby","original_name":"Ollie Kirby","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/7yXSNf0sRj5gBnfe3Nb4OEupMHp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Undetermined Role","credit_id":"62e2ab90d371970067b4d836","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Neville Buck","original_name":"Charles Neville Buck","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e2aad4e18e3f027ba00973","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384804,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Dillon","original_name":"Robert Dillon","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e2aaeaafe224004fa25173","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Francis Dillon","original_name":"John Francis Dillon","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/8WWebUUEfcpcTvUNhFAeeoPRQbR.jpg","credit_id":"62e2aac7da10f00136c860f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0004188","wikidata_id":"Q3987800","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b0oREKL3W63KWa1AJPv03KMTm3B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
