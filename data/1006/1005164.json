The drinks industry produces 470 billion single-use bottles each year, 25% of which come from Coca-Cola. Although the world's largest soft drink producer has set ambitious targets to prevent this environmental pollution, it has often failed to do so. In the 1950s, the company sold its drink exclusively in returnable glass bottles, which it washed and refilled. Two decades later, these were replaced by disposable bottles - a decision whose devastating effects still linger.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/vcoebH3QcfOsY36EJTPMbuC02Ax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":139350,"logo_path":null,"name":"A&O Buero Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":5843,"logo_path":"/c1NzKYz0tijvhYJZvdn9VhH4HwG.png","name":"Renegade Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Plastic: Coca Cola/American Plastic","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Coca-Cola's 100 Billion Bottle Problem","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2681395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Mulholland","original_name":"Laura Mulholland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6308e408ca7ec6007efcb73e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2681395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Mulholland","original_name":"Laura Mulholland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1170977070000500d56bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3639163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Stern","original_name":"Max Stern","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e11727aa659e004df746f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21416192","wikidata_id":"","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnttYhPxCuAtPtrYSP3NQXaiQnk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t8LlpPGe1JqkzRf4asWydjLZaCK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vcoebH3QcfOsY36EJTPMbuC02Ax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6hZEVlaXxaHxdOlMMTnTslULALO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6305,"name":"pollution"},{"id":6133,"name":"industry"},{"id":192706,"name":"soda"},{"id":300537,"name":"alimentation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
