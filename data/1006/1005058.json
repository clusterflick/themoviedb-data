Two hundred people still live in the community. The film narrates the story of the Volcano´s spell on the community, when she discovered that incestous relationships were practised there. She erupted, leaving the village in ruins, but being a female herself considered the men guilty and allowed only the women to remain in the village. The film tells what happens after the Spanish conquest when the Christian decided to put an end to the Volcano’s power to cast spells, and the state of the village nowadays.","popularity":0.0513,"poster_path":"/dKKzQnGiCWIGnQTvcam9rNplGHX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Casire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3638802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurora Colina","original_name":"Aurora Colina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aurora Colina (Voice)","credit_id":"62e098821dbc880673167ffd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1006263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delfina Paredes","original_name":"Delfina Paredes","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Delfina Paredes (Voice)","credit_id":"62e098a7bbcae0004dcabe7c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Eyde","original_name":"Marianne Eyde","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e098daaa659e004df70f0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456846,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edgard Lostaunau","original_name":"Edgard Lostaunau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e098fc48138200541af993","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576929,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michèle André","original_name":"Michèle André","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e0990b481382004fbca236","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Eyde","original_name":"Marianne Eyde","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e098cf33a5330520100f32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Eyde","original_name":"Marianne Eyde","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e098e933a5330520100f3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l156pBjtEItAaDxsD2FMEHgaSG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKKzQnGiCWIGnQTvcam9rNplGHX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
