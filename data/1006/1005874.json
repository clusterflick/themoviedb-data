On January 17 all over the island, the first festivities of the year are being prepared: \"Sa prima essia\" the festivals dedicated to fire. A craftsman is forging what is not a simple mask but is almost a tool for connecting with another place. That archaic man performs the same gesture in the legend of Saint Anthony the Abbot or of Prometheus: he hands the fire to men. This fire nowadays and since past times heats up in the cold nights, cooks and manipulates food so that man can enjoy it, it rises high and burns the misfortunes of the past pains in order to start a new life.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/bgiaHwQKl9PNmaDqTUK5TD0AKEq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FÓGU","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4066831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Mescolini","original_name":"Francesco Mescolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6464b52bf48b3401552da75c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4066832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Rinicella","original_name":"Marco Rinicella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6464b532f48b3400fea60d10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgiaHwQKl9PNmaDqTUK5TD0AKEq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"71.
