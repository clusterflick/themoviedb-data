Diane and Kate are now 80 years old. At the time, they were men and part of this secret organization. Today, they relate this forgotten but essential chapter of the early days of trans-identity. It is a story full of noise and fury, rich in extraordinary characters, including the famous Susanna, who had the courage to create this refuge that came to be known as Casa Susanna.","popularity":0.6754,"poster_path":"/yA2MECN8Vd0GMauNY83qavNP8w4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":92479,"logo_path":"/xBlCFYbQb8H4ZpIMLco53ybin9L.png","name":"American Experience Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":50510,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Storyville","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"More than a home.
