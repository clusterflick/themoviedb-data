Space where agreements are made with the energies/forces/spirits that provide us with life. The Milpa is essential for the Mayans, not only does it provide us with food, it also contains us emotionally, without the Milpa there is no life. During the story we will explore the connection of the Mayan people with this space and the relationship with the forces that articulate it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mqrqJswYb3ReEYzlDrRLozfdP7a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milpa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mqrqJswYb3ReEYzlDrRLozfdP7a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
