Later, John and Palma meet again, marry, and go west to manage a lumber camp, as instructed by John's wealthy father, Jarvis Tabor. Displeased by John's choice of wife, the elder Tabor tests the couple with difficult living conditions, which eventually discourage Palma, and she accepts the party invitation of Keith Merwyn, manager of the cabaret where she starred. Meanwhile, Merwyn effects a disturbance among the lumbermen, endangering John.","popularity":0.2212,"poster_path":"/96jfjjDQXrGBMLAtHrv7ZML8ot3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Holtre Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ALMA MAY, like the Irene Castle of real life, was the brightest figure in New York's brightest night life.
