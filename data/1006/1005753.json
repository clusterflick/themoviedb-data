Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is the scene of an unarmed uprising that ousts the dictator in power since 1987 and later staves off an attempted coup. In 2015, the country votes freely for the first time in its history, yet real change remains allusive, especially regarding ongoing economic exploitation by foreign companies. In one year of struggle and resistance, the film follows the daily life of four Burkinabes: a musician and leader of the revolution, a local political candidate, a miner engaged in the labor movement, and an impoverished mother, all sharing hopes that the elections will change the country’s path.","popularity":0.2172,"poster_path":"/vrR1qYCpuwEB8lA64w8vC1eGNRS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centro Produzione Audiovisivi Università di Roma
