With the US government finally admitting that many of the unexplained sightings of UFO craft may very well be alien technology, we are emerging into a new era, that of a \"Unified Theory of the Paranormal\" that may provide answers for many enigmas of the unknown. It involves the ancient eastern concept of \"oneness\" recognized by our forefathers, long before the arcane physics of quantum mechanics demonstrated it's reality. Let us explore the Book of Secrets and face who the aliens are, where they come from and why they are here.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/8d5mG5BqRaQTnnA8Ye7xE5uvMTa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Book of Secrets: Aliens, Ghosts and Ancient Mysteries","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"O.H.
