In America, she captivates many men but cares for none of them until she meets Lieutenant John Long. At first, he regards Varda as little more than a social butterfly, but gradually comes to recognize her goodness and falls in love with her. While John is away on a war-related diplomatic mission, Varda agrees to aid the U.S. Secret Service in procuring classified documents from August Von Grossman, an agent whom she had known in Austria.","popularity":0.2087,"poster_path":"/7AAc1PkIicwSFWyrdpyjlrn4MUh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When a Woman Stoops to Folly She Must Suffer the Consequences.
