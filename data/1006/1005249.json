Richard Leslie, the head of an explosives manufacturing company, offers to buy his new discovery, but Lamont turns him down. Afraid that his formula will be stolen by Leslie, Lamont uses invisible ink to tattoo part of the formula on his daughter Grace's shoulder. A spy for a foreign government finds out about it, kills Lamont and kidnaps Grace, hypnotizing her so she'll tell him where the formula is. She is rescued by Leslie in the nick of time, but her troubles, as it turns out, are not yet over.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":179474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sulmac Production Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2444954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Davison","original_name":"Grace Davison","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grace Lamont","credit_id":"62e142a15ca7042619f42de3","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2687520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Osborn","original_name":"Ralph Osborn","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eben Lamont","credit_id":"62e142b5e9da6927465e1c11","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard L'Estrange","original_name":"Richard L'Estrange","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/ubM9lTn9d14Zvhkl2o9PYluIOvU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Richard Leslie","credit_id":"62e142c877070000500d6e48","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3639304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clayton Davis","original_name":"Clayton Davis","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"August Mason","credit_id":"62e142df021cee004d77e87e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3639303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Norman Harsell","original_name":"Norman Harsell","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e1427fbbcae0004dcb0c26","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard L'Estrange","original_name":"Richard L'Estrange","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/ubM9lTn9d14Zvhkl2o9PYluIOvU.jpg","credit_id":"62e1427047c9fb016b0bcac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0195780","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
