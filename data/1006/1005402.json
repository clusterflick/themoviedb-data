From his arrival in New York City as a displaced person in 1949 to his death in 2019, he chronicled the trauma and loss of exile while pioneering institutions to support the growth of independent film in the United States. Fragments of Paradise is an intimate look at his life and work constructed from thousands of hours of his own video and film diaries-including never-before-seen tapes and unpublished audio recordings. It is a story about finding beauty amidst profound loss, and a man who tried to make sense of it all... with a camera.","popularity":0.7422,"poster_path":"/qD6fuAN3gba8DEI4mZc7yRkMLNO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72946,"logo_path":"/bnK0eEBYKv7bf5m030ID30IoHRE.png","name":"Kunhardt Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Catch some of the beauty, some of the happiness...\"","title":"Fragments of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"631dff5c9c24fc007a463cd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Taubin","original_name":"Amy Taubin","popularity":0.1195,"profile_path":"/7GCbAyF9c3KhXtXNep3aa1wksuQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631dff10d8f44e00826b5431","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","original_name":"Peter Bogdanovich","popularity":0.8766,"profile_path":"/m3aMMYzzEbqKEwGOyEPq7Rt1gAj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631dff16ce9e91007f752ff7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Waters","original_name":"John Waters","popularity":1.5612,"profile_path":"/4foU1kJ24CJwz2RVZgyc7oxMs4i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631dff22568463007e33f792","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Scorsese","original_name":"Martin Scorsese","popularity":2.5528,"profile_path":"/9U9Y5GQuWX3EZy39B8nkk4NY01S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631dff645684630083ccda17","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flo Jacobs","original_name":"Flo Jacobs","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631dff6d1ac292007aa7c705","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631dff72bd3209008272dbde","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.M.
