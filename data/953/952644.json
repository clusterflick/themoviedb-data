The true creators of the revolution. Revolutions of the spirit. The stars of the Russian avant-garde of the early 20th century managed to make a real world revolution. Their works, their ideas still influence the life of every modern person. The film will focus on the Russian avant-garde in art and literature. Vladimir Mayakovsky, Marc Chagall, Vasily Kandinsky, David Burliuk, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Tatlin and many others - they were called hooligans and rowdies from art, and they were looking for a new form for a new life. They changed everything - from painting and architecture to advertising and music. It was a challenge to the whole world, a rebellion and an attempt to create a man of the future. That is why modern young people should talk about the most revolutionary trend in art. They try on the roles of avant-gardists, evaluate situations and facts, looking into the past from the 21st century.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avant-Garde of the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Sarychev","original_name":"Nikita Sarychev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239d45c34e152007350c784","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
