It unfolds in four parts that will change seasonally, creating an ephemeral experience of Agatha’s activities as she responds to changes in the weather and the needs of daily life. Atkins says that the film “reflects my desire to communicate the healing that can unfold through a connection with nature, and the stabilizing power of repetitive actions as we move into the constantly shifting future.”","popularity":0.1253,"poster_path":"/3HZNzBgBMp4TEPqWoktDWom9JZ4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agatha’s Almanac: WATCH YOUR CORNER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Watch Your Corner","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5244453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amalie Atkins","original_name":"Amalie Atkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ade54ff28d95adb3d0b830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5244453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amalie Atkins","original_name":"Amalie Atkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ade7aff28d95adb3d0b97e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3HZNzBgBMp4TEPqWoktDWom9JZ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Anchorage Museum","release_date":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
