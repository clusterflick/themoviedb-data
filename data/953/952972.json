What if consciousness is not asleep? What if everyone is the creator of their own universe, but does not remember about it?.. A number of experiments on the study of sleep were conducted in order to fix the connection between the consciousness of the sleeper and the physiological reaction of the body. Where does consciousness go every night and how does it come in the morning? In the film, the viewer is waiting for interviews with people who are professionally engaged in the study of dreams, the issues of the relationship of religions to dreams, archetypes of interpretation of dreams (the language of the unconscious) and working with them as a way of studying personality are touched upon. The mechanisms of \"awareness\" of oneself in a dream are considered.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Book of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Ovsyannikov","original_name":"Denis Ovsyannikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623ad3c06bdec30092e5a017","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
