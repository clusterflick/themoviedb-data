История последнего полета","overview":"In 2001, near Pskov, at an air show, a disaster occurred in front of 10,000 spectators. The crash of the plane, which was controlled by Timur Apakidze, was filmed by dozens of cameras. The film also contains the voice of Apakidze himself, who, shortly before his death, as if anticipating it, managed to talk about how the pilot feels in an emergency flight, being on the verge of life and death. And how painful is the choice between ejection-life and the desire to save the plane.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":"/8KWqfQNQb4aGF2HpD9VSrk5hEP4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Risk Film and Video Studio","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2005-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timur.
