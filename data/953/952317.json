As part of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, the scenic roadway received 1.34 billion dollars in federal funds to link what are now known as Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on the leeward side of Oʻahu, and Kāneʻohe Marine Corps Base on the windward side. Championed by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the project was exempted from environmental law as a rider on a 1986 Appropriations Bill (H.J. Res. 738), allowing it to cut through the valleys of North Hālawa and Haʻikū.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kau ʻeliʻeli kau mai, kau ʻeliʻeli ē","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"kekahi wahi","original_name":"kekahi wahi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238c95f7304b5007dcd3a8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
