Infuriated riders scrambled under turnstiles and through exit doors, refusing to pay the fare. In THE WRECK OF THE NEW YORK SUBWAYS riders and subway workers denounce the terrible conditions and constant fare increases. The film analyzes the vicious cycle of bonding the Transit Authority, which profits the banks at the expense of the taxpayers.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86755,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third World Newsreel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wreck of the New York Subways (Newsreel #47)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Newsreel","original_name":"Newsreel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238e2497a1bd60072a606e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
