He is buried in an unmarked spot in the huge Verano Cemetery in Rome. The task seems more difficult than expected, but this long search turns into a journey through anarchism, which begins at the birth of the unforgettable revolutionary and covers a century and a half of the history of anarchism, drawing on texts written by Malatesta and other intellectuals who lived after him, up to and beyond the 21st century. This documentary is also a political manifesto that wants to bring back to the forefront a discourse that seems to have been interrupted in public opinion for too many years, putting forward scientific and philosophical references that can stimulate and give a new impulse to anarchist alternatives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Errico Malatesta - Vers une nouvelle humanite","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
