Driven by the magic of his experiences, his background as a chef, and his love of good food and connecting people to incredible places that open up to conversation, he created Camp Yoshi, which curates custom outdoor adventures centered around shared meals and shared experience with the goal of creating a space for Black people and allies to unplug and in turn reconnect with the wilderness. By virtue of being in these places, Camp Yoshi's trips transform historically segregated spaces into safe havens for the community, conversation, and nourishment.","popularity":0.7789,"poster_path":"/qoKrMokbTr02dUUoS2GZATCihfs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166151,"logo_path":"/v2fsSdwCcQ97scCWpTau9cBXrLW.png","name":"REI Co-op Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camp Yoshi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3555170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rashad Frazier","original_name":"Rashad Frazier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6285bd87fa78cd2dc3794537","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2304264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Faith E.
