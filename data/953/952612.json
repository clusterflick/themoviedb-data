In this documentary, Ron weaves his life’s story from his home in the idyllic village of Neil’s Harbour, Cape Breton. He recounts his experiences and the vast changes he witnessed in the fishing industry over the last century and shows his hand-knitting skills while repairing fishing nets, a sustainable practice barely employed today. Through Ron’s story, we acknowledge practices lost over time and the importance of listening and learning while the knowledge is available.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/jxiH7qY4Abi8SJ7WFdh51jag4Av.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44810,"logo_path":"/fwnOlu3T5VrgVWruS7rck7tWprC.png","name":"Les Films du 3 Mars","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meshes of the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Ingraham","original_name":"Ron Ingraham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6239c8e78ec4ab0077dd36d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2738487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Lewis","original_name":"Hannah Lewis","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c900d29bdd0045478f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica C","original_name":"Jessica C","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c91a9ee0ef001c94bf2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475720,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathieu Blackburn","original_name":"Mathieu Blackburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c932894ed6001ca96cc9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica C","original_name":"Jessica C","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c93e34e152001cd7b635","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2738487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Lewis","original_name":"Hannah Lewis","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c9549ee0ef001c94bf8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625494,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shelley Craig","original_name":"Shelley Craig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c96c7a1bd6001cef3d7a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475721,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roy Vucino","original_name":"Roy Vucino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c98534e15200462bea20","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475720,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathieu Blackburn","original_name":"Mathieu Blackburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c99b0752880072038ab8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220020,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denis Pilon","original_name":"Denis Pilon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239c9b08ec4ab001bdb6602","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ba8RrJ9ialP10PfdMJ9nZMA8rC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mJHcO8LIaotJRTktWy8gilvcOv0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxiH7qY4Abi8SJ7WFdh51jag4Av.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
