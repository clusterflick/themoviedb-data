Snow is vital to the balance of mountain ecosystems. Many animal and plant species at high altitudes depend on it for their survival. But due to global warming, snow is falling less and less. Will there be no more snow in the future? In the Alps and eastern US the situation is clear: as temperatures rise, snow falls less and less, and snow periods tend to shorten. This threatens the mountain flora and fauna. What future do the marmots or alpine bells have without a heat-insulating layer of snow? What future do the marmots or alpine bells have without a heat-insulating layer of snow? What will happen to the conifers in North America without the annual frost protection? Research teams are looking at the implications for snow-adapted species. The documentation shows animal mountain dwellers, who hope for the long-awaited snow every winter.","popularity":0.4719,"poster_path":"/afwhUo9xbL6AsswCpqUPm4s1PgA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amberjack Films","origin_country":""},{"id":172078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Copan Films","origin_country":""},{"id":172079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ouragan films","origin_country":""},{"id":100703,"logo_path":"/9IE9Ufq245H68emvzgNJZ6Ke6F8.png","name":"Saint Thomas Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10159,"logo_path":null,"name":"nWave Pictures","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Search for Snow","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"En attendant la neige","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Snow","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Esperando la nieve: ¿En peligro de extinción?","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Czekając na śnieg","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Aspettando la neve -
