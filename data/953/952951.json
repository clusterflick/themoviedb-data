See the majestic moose and elk with their huge antlers, rare trumpeter swan, ever-hungry bear, playful river otter, skittish coyote and shaggy buffalo, all in their native environment.  The park fought for it's life in the fires of 1988 - seen in dramatic footage - but endures as a year-round riot of color and contrast, topped off by the towering geyser of Old Faithful","popularity":0.147,"poster_path":"/3PjoC6G5whFR8FqJIpn24LGM2QK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Times DVD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America's National Parks: The Sights and Sounds of Yellowstone National Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Campanella","original_name":"Joseph Campanella","popularity":0.3745,"profile_path":"/o6A0IZkjcDNDVBTFCVLsdySz3w3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"623ab5a4a349110093c4dc39","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PjoC6G5whFR8FqJIpn24LGM2QK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
