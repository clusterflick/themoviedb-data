It is elementary then that artists should be preoccupied with a phenomenon whose ageless nature remains elusive and opaque. Bruce and Norman Yonemoto's A History of Clouds (33:46 mins, Color) investigates the representation of clouds as they appear in art, first as amorphic elements in early oil painting, then as photographically reproduced elements of 20th-century works. This premiere videowork ends in the advertising studio where clouds provide a \"natural\" backdrop for commodified dreams. The journey from representation to sales presentation is complete.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/irJLrcJDDnz3sHsfzbOQGR6j13E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A History of Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1154811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Yonemoto","original_name":"Norman Yonemoto","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/jD3I91Y7TiA3t2PA9OIJeK0QGBM.jpg","credit_id":"62394e38d70594001bbd8f77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1407074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Yonemoto","original_name":"Bruce Yonemoto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62394e22b234b9007bec8018","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/irJLrcJDDnz3sHsfzbOQGR6j13E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
