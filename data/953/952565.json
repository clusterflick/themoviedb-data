At first glance Crowley is a little cowboy, but he is 'not quite there yet' as he says himself. A real cowboy takes on responsibility and is able to stand on his own two feet. Crowley helps out on the ranch wherever he can: he helps branding animals, catching cattle, that got lost in the large canyons and repairing the fences. It's not an easy life. But nonetheless, he wants to take over the ranch when he's all grown up so he can finally say: I am a real cowboy!","popularity":0.1259,"poster_path":"/ztNgHGpJr66PPq3BxB6xZ4DtjJC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowley: Every Cowboy Needs His Horse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1693137,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Bergmann","original_name":"Tom Bergmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239ba3654a8ac007c5c7029","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Hörmann","original_name":"André Hörmann","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239ba19ee43e80043ba8e17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Hörmann","original_name":"André Hörmann","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239ba230752880072035fed","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52547,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vincent Assmann","original_name":"Vincent Assmann","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239ba4534e152001cd78aa6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5144500","wikidata_id":"Q26911466","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ztNgHGpJr66PPq3BxB6xZ4DtjJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milwaukee Film Festival","release_date":"2016-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
