His dream is to make it one day onto one of the lorries leading to the UK - and hopefully a better life. But despite a remarkable sense of community, the conditions in the jungle are harsh and taking its toll. Teefa has spent almost half a year in the camp and is tired of trying to cross, as only a few are lucky enough to succeed. After all jungles are evicted by the police in order to move the refugees to a new camp, Teefa starts to question the greatness of Britain and considers other options instead.","popularity":0.1152,"poster_path":"/sNlMNHIcrLeOu8thfq3kvNipB5d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transit Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederik Subei","original_name":"Frederik Subei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238bbd734e152001cd3e41d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederik Subei","original_name":"Frederik Subei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238bbe7209f18001b655577","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6328628","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sNlMNHIcrLeOu8thfq3kvNipB5d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel (informal date)","release_date":"2016-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Transit Zone | Frederik Subei","key":"jzH-pP51y5U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-05T13:30:09.000Z","id":"6238bb8ae272600071d82742"}]}}}
