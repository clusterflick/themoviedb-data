They don't have it, so they don't need it. “Imagine” is a film-journey to the border area. Blinded due to an illness, an art critic, a fan of painting who lost her sight after the birth of children, an artist who has been blind since childhood. The heroes of the film are people who are in love with art, looking for an opportunity to reconnect with visual culture, cut off by circumstances. What do those who seem to see nothing actually see? What do those who have recently become blind remember? And how do those who live in darkness imagine the world?","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2118972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katerina Gordeeva","original_name":"Katerina Gordeeva","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/yskxw5XoSRw7fIId7SRls6AuYzo.jpg","credit_id":"6239e6cb075288007203ec14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2141293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Vokhmintsev","original_name":"Viktor Vokhmintsev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4yAJ3Xf2oAJfjBi98AXpXp5FYLs.jpg","credit_id":"6239e6e51ad93b0045a36e5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolay Kovalkov","original_name":"Nikolay Kovalkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239e7027a1bd60072a92896","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
