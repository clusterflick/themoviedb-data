The place has become a tourist's attraction: people come here to take a souvenire photo with the house, and sometimes with the master himself. The film, however, tells about the everyday life of a person who does what he loves, not paying attention to popularity, not seeking acclaim. It is a story about the harmony of solitude.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":"/pgbzwRQFNyWsAU5fvDGrRWWVQ4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Острів","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalia Krasilnikova","original_name":"Natalia Krasilnikova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623870d0db4ed6001b06528e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalia Krasilnikova","original_name":"Natalia Krasilnikova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623870d934e152001cd2aecc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474497,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ruslan Girin","original_name":"Ruslan Girin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623870ec0752880045a14a39","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474498,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daria Szewczenko","original_name":"Daria Szewczenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623870fc0752880072fe7450","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4391940","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/pgbzwRQFNyWsAU5fvDGrRWWVQ4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Zwiastun - Wyspa - Wajda School and Studio","key":"r9XS8j6MDrs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-03-01T14:59:40.000Z","id":"6238707e34e15200734c18ee"}]}}}
