Now he has to face a new challenge: to survive freedom.  Curtis was only 22 when he was sentenced to death for a crime he didn’t commit and spent 22 years in prison, 19 of them in death row, buried alive below ground in a concrete room with no windows, waiting to be executed, in Oklahoma State Penitentiary. “A Declaration Of Love” by Director Marco Speroni, aims to give voice to a man who is being cruelly persecuted by a perverse legal system, digging into his deepest and most hidden emotions. The film is a visual journey through Curtis’s glance and his sense of displacement towards a world where he doesn’t belong anymore. “A Declaration Of Love” is a singular way of addressing the barbarity of the death penalty and also a chance to explore a crucial question: what does “freedom” mean in a society that refuses a person like Curtis despite all he went through?","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/iMB8QWTnOLp9X9fRw9bD0ydxlbl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nacne","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Declaration of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"Spain","title":"Una declaración de amor","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433702,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Federico Schiavi","original_name":"Federico Schiavi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cb38e35c30a00497c473c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riccardo Russo","original_name":"Riccardo Russo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cb1866f43ec005c9d9a18","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3478546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Speroni","original_name":"Marco Speroni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cb0eca349110048e7dbb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3478546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Speroni","original_name":"Marco Speroni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cb124d1a893005cca95db","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14366518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1370,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iMB8QWTnOLp9X9fRw9bD0ydxlbl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
