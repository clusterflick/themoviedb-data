However, Nope! isn’t a criticism generally associated with these themes, but rather an ironic, light and playful insight into today’s youth culture.  The new generation of dreamers and creators is represented as fluorescent, digital and slightly foggy. In line with Schinaia’s directorial style, the short film relies on compelling visuals and sound as much as on the script to unfold its narrative. Working exclusively with a very young team across styling, music, cinematography, post-production, sound design, graphic design and illustration, Nope! becomes a tribute to the fresh and innovative creative talent of tomorrow.","popularity":0.3733,"poster_path":"/5DRqXzKeaIaozZkvU2FjY9iXxzc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basement","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The short film is a reflection on our society, as it looks at our relationship with drugs and the internet and the way these forms of addiction tend to dilute the value we place on human interactions.","title":"NOPE!","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian Gibertoni","original_name":"Fabian Gibertoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Him","credit_id":"6239d98254a8ac007c5cc1b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Apache","original_name":"Veronica Apache","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Her","credit_id":"6239d9920752880045a66315","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475818,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Julia Beo","original_name":"Julia Beo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239db99075288007203c582","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gianluca Oliva","original_name":"Gianluca Oliva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239db7734e152001cd7f282","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Monti","original_name":"Marco Monti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239dbad54a8ac007c5cc742","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3025883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sami Schinaia","original_name":"Sami Schinaia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4QjVqPAZcofPETbURJyjBDGa2B1.jpg","credit_id":"6239d9b434e15200462c1aa1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475816,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Claudia Decaro","original_name":"Claudia Decaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6239db64ee43e8001bb638e8","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15479832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5DRqXzKeaIaozZkvU2FjY9iXxzc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9696,"name":"magic mushroom"},{"id":274299,"name":"tinder"},{"id":294299,"name":"shrooms"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NOPE!
