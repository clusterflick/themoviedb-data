But this time he is hit harder than the times before and the lonely shepherdess Rita rescues him unconscious from the ditch. On her farm she treats him and the two quirky nonconformists quickly become close. They enjoy each other's company until Luise, one of Rita's sheep, is torn by a wolf. Thereupon, the two's differing worldviews begin to destroy the budding romance. Alex underestimates Rita's intense loyalty with the wolf and she, on the other hand, underestimates his with Luise the sheep.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wilde Himbeeren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Vitua","original_name":"Sabine Vitua","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/9AssDcB3VCw7Khesw8dh6UnHMXg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rita","credit_id":"62387996894ed6001ca4e67a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3474544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Auer","original_name":"Philipp Auer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"623879bb8ac3d0007579ae2a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Christin König","original_name":"Marie Christin König","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623879e98ac3d0007579ae97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21228756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
