Does it have any survival value? Bidhin Bal's 'Poojyam' (Zero) is an enquiry into this entanglement of being and nothingness. Set in a rural premise of Kerala, India, the film compells us to contemplate about birth, being, death and everything in between. The birth is not just a birth and the death is not just a death in a post-colony. It connotes and signifies the stories of the struggles, survival where the everyday mundane and the mysterious nature overlap and intervene. Questions of spirit, liberation and absolvement appears in the film not as abstract questions but as the mystical presence of shady nature.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":172000,"logo_path":null,"name":"machucando","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Zero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"0","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474559,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thamjeedh","original_name":"Thamjeedh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62387dfa894ed600467f4b49","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474557,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Deepak Padmanabhan","original_name":"Deepak Padmanabhan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62387dc49ee0ef001c9060f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abhyuday","original_name":"Abhyuday","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238a32d209f180072dbfd4b","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hossein Sabzian","original_name":"Hossein Sabzian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238a3889ee0ef001c90ea7c","department":"Production","job":"Publicist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bidhin Bal","original_name":"Bidhin Bal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238a294db4ed600451ce5b8","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474723,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rajesh Das","original_name":"Rajesh Das","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238a2d434e152001cd36e83","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560316,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ganesh Marar","original_name":"Ganesh Marar","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238a265ee43e8001bb21dff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bidhin Bal","original_name":"Bidhin Bal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640e8b77e18e3f07d0547553","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bidhin Bal","original_name":"Bidhin Bal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640e8b3cede1b000a2a111af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bidhin Bal","original_name":"Bidhin Bal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640e8b2dede1b000f8a20866","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bidhin Bal","original_name":"Bidhin Bal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640e8b62ede1b000d975683f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
