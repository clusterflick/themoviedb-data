The satellite was launched into space, but unfortunately, it could not reach the specified orbit due to the launch vehicle accident. But this did not stop our enthusiasts. Now they are busy developing a closed biosphere based on microalgae to support long-range space flights. It's not quite working out yet, but the road will be mastered by the walking one.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amateurs in Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2081855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitry Zavilgelsky","original_name":"Dmitry Zavilgelsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sfrHeBXv5VdFGKDwmPBWc2oRnr6.jpg","credit_id":"6239a5edd29bdd004547462b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
