In 1999, he decided to overthrow the current government, first in Vyshny Volochok, and then in the country. In order to take possession of the weapon, Alexander wanted to seize the local police department. On the night of April 9-10, 1999 — the eve of Orthodox Easter — Sysoev staged a shooting at the police department of the city of Vyshny Volochek. As a result of this attack, three police officers were killed. Sysoev was detained, and after an investigation in 2000, the court found him insane and sent him to compulsory psychiatric treatment. 15 years later, in 2015, Sysoev was released. Sergey Yerzhenkov found Alexander and went with him to Vyshny Volochek.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloody Easter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","original_name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/niBmn0kUWgElf9694PzLOfroTyy.jpg","credit_id":"6239b517894ed6004683b715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
