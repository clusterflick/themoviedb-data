People try to show us the border and share stories of how it affects their lives. They sing about the soil on the other side and mourn what has been lost. This was once an area where people of different groups lived together, but wars and forced migrations have transformed a “we” into “us and them”. The border is very real and impossible to cross. But it is abstract and invisible in the landscape. Where is it? Is it inside us?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":279677,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iris Film
