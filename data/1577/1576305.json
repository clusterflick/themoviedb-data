These include 60047 Donovan, 60059 Tracery, 60064 Tagalie and 60110 Robert the Devil, all named after famous race horses. As well as these wonderful steam locos we also see rushing through more modern units including Class 313s, 317s and HSTs. From here we go just a short distance to Liverpool Street Station and the Jazz Services steaming in and out including 70001 Lord Hurcomb, 70030 William Wordsworth and 70007 Coeur de Lion. But what a different place this station is some years later with all the steam engines gone and modern electric EMUs and Class 315s and 322s in operation. We move on to the North Eastern Railway and York, one of the most important railway junction stations in the country and now home to the National Railway Museum. Our visit to the LNER ends with the thrilling sight of the Sir Nigel Gresley running at speed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6SGiJsSUrMehAj2fDdfLzAr56fw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain's Railways Then & Now: LNER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34793710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2142,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6SGiJsSUrMehAj2fDdfLzAr56fw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1428}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
