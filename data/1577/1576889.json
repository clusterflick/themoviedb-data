Only dreams and expectations remain.” — Eino Ruutsalo","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ouEskcjphc02gm3UuQVOGXMdcEE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Food","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eino Ruutsalo","original_name":"Eino Ruutsalo","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/wsvzzHVsYkFPLdp6CS8jXVSF1Np.jpg","credit_id":"690f409ce24e363ff987489f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ouEskcjphc02gm3UuQVOGXMdcEE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
