Children have been disappearing and Rani suspects the appearance of a clown at the school is significant. In fact the last two to go missing had tickets to the Museum of the Circus, which Sarah Jane, Rani and the boys investigate. It is run by Elijah Spellman, a smilingly sinister figure, who sets clown robots on the group, though Sarah Jane uses her sonic lipstick to immobilise them. The group escape after Spellman has turned first into the Pied Piper and then into Odd Bob the clown.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/5sG1Yc28pFJkox6Ha3fVd4CjhGK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/igWZmjr5Zhbnxf7DinSOLoiggLU.png","name":"BBC Cymru
