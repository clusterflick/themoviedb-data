The man calls himself Zorro — he lives on the streets, dances at night, and spends his days following “normal” people to expose their hypocrisy and insecurity. And the actor?

The new work by Castellitto, ironically suspended between theater and life.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/fRQYbVyQHPv6dtL9W7uQfUExbuZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Zorro - Un eremita sul marciapiede","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Castellitto","original_name":"Sergio Castellitto","popularity":1.0208,"profile_path":"/uq5xz7kinzgdclGOcechgfPBgYC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"690e1604c5c5faff3aa0bce1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Castellitto","original_name":"Sergio Castellitto","popularity":1.0208,"profile_path":"/uq5xz7kinzgdclGOcechgfPBgYC.jpg","credit_id":"690e161ace9c1f48f79ab2e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227521,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Mazzantini","original_name":"Margaret Mazzantini","popularity":1.0311,"profile_path":"/w1QLSKiArdo5qfIjckQXmRyCB5H.jpg","credit_id":"690e164da5ef06b8d24c72d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1631,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fRQYbVyQHPv6dtL9W7uQfUExbuZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"TORINO FILM FESTIVAL","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
