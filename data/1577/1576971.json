Laika is a little stray dog from the streets of Moscow, who has been stranded on that same asteroid for a very long time...  Talia is in a one-track mind about finding her way off of this forsaken rock. Laika just seems thrilled to have someone to play with her. But when fixes fail, and unexpected communications bridge the expanse between Talia and the Earth, she realises that Laika may be the key to finding her way home - wherever that ends up being.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l9RKRpLuUuuALx6fvr5ylciMR8g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28773,"logo_path":"/xExfu7jizsp3P0nqdwfz7ohpzaf.png","name":"The Animation School","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If home is where your friends are, how far would you go to find it?","title":"Laika Goes Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kosy Diamonda","original_name":"Kosy Diamonda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Talia Valentine (voice)","credit_id":"690f777455b34f734fa0c22e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iwan Crafford","original_name":"Iwan Crafford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ground Control (voice)","credit_id":"690f77846907a239e64c7909","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804300,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Can Richards","original_name":"Can Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f77be312ecd29889aba86","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804302,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sanaa Ally","original_name":"Sanaa Ally","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f77d4b82cc8c707dd1b23","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804308,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jayme Wakeford","original_name":"Jayme Wakeford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f7815b71c88ee06d2519e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Can Richards","original_name":"Can Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f782d2c2055c6bf31ac83","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Can Richards","original_name":"Can Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f78702c2055c6bf31ac92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804326,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alexa Wium","original_name":"Alexa Wium","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f79b3d3f869f103d2516f","department":"Art","job":"Concept Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804335,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Haenen","original_name":"Anthony Haenen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f7b9d2f9649b50a4c7bf8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Haenen","original_name":"Anthony Haenen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f7bc02d43dd68d6d251f0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7yv8mApkgPB6lrjO1w8kbEWpcm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2822,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l9RKRpLuUuuALx6fvr5ylciMR8g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1995}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
