He is best known for his collaboration with writer James Agee on the book \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\", which illustrated the plight of tenant farmers during the Great Depression. A pioneer of the documentary style of photography, Evans was the first photographer to have a one-man retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art. His photographs, from southern sharecroppers to New York subway riders, are point-of-view images that reflect his distinctive vision of America.  Walker Evans/America contains rare interviews with Evans himself, recorded by filmmaker Sedat Pakay while a student at Yale University in the late 1960s.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l6y85XqFIyWqX5HvUkpxSn5TQ1R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192582,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hudson Film Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film by Sedat Pakay","title":"Walker Evans / America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Walker Evans/America","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.G.
