Microgravity, the vacuum of space, extremes of temperature, micrometeorites - life here is perilous.  To mark 25 years of continuous habitation onboard, Space Station We Have a Problem reveals how astronauts are only a technical glitch or software error away from disaster. From malfunctioning spacesuits and docking disasters, critical leaks and even the entire space station backflipping out of control, this is life and death played out in low earth orbit, coupled with the bravery and brilliance that each time, saves the day.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vRsh6lPz2GqiosCSx56iZ9FvUuz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"250 Miles up is a long way from home","title":"Space Station: We Have A Problem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oscar Chan","original_name":"Oscar Chan","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690de6a21416e111b6ce7b87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1144,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vRsh6lPz2GqiosCSx56iZ9FvUuz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.thegardencinema.co.uk/film/space-station-we-have-a-problem/","release_date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
