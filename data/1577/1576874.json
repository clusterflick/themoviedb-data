Sandwiched between a binocular-toting Manhattan voyeur and a naughty public access TV actress, “Rosa” described her lifestyle as a “stunt exhibitionist”. Unbeknownst to the audience, the “Rosa” character was mostly a fabrication, allowing Nao to roll out a kinky sex-positive spin, mindtripping Middle America while those in the know basked in the televised glow of her performance art prank. Based on the experience, Nao later constructed the video/performance “Rosa does Joan” for Artists Television Access in San Francisco.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosa Does Joan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nao Bustamante","original_name":"Nao Bustamante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"690f3f040d1d06c2f031a87b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Rivers","original_name":"Joan Rivers","popularity":0.6403,"profile_path":"/ocCom3OjllEUQBTK3RhK4dwS23H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"690f3f104ef72b612e31a952","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4817309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nao Bustamante","original_name":"Nao Bustamante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f3f3d119eef2e209ab87b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
