The characters of INSIDEOUT reveal their thoughts, dilemmas and crises in this open forum as if they were in a confession box. We are led to wonder about what makes them open up so intimately and who they are really addressing. The video is a patchwork of fragments from the lives of completely different people, and is based exclusively on sound and footage from individuals on YouTube. Tonje Alice Madsen mixes this pixilated world together to form a new reality - a shared story that both exists and is fictional.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insideout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119772,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tonje Alice Madsen","original_name":"Tonje Alice Madsen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690e30b3cb8da97d83d24d04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
