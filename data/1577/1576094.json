Projected through overlapping red and blue image streams, the film uses colour-filtered glasses to divide the audience’s visual experience. Two people seated side by side may watch the same screen...but not the same movie. Blending archival propaganda, poetic narration, and formal play, the film explores how missed information is often the root of misinformation. Evoking Godard with a touch of William Castle, \"Au Hasard\" is both a cinema of ideas and an act of cinematic misdirection.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ysWIXLhYQu1bIMoklWVGHArMIXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Film You Don't See","title":"Au Hasard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5597500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Dominique Heroux","original_name":"Darren Dominique Heroux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690d6d38212f6c374bce7969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ysWIXLhYQu1bIMoklWVGHArMIXI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
