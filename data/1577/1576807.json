In a moment of intimacy, the woman, whom we come to understand is a field worker, and the plants talk about bodily rights, infertility, labor, and monocrops. As a human, the spectator is unable to hear the voice of the corn plants, perceiving the dialogue as a weird monologue. The film’s script is inspired by the writing of Brazilian author João Guimarães Rosa, in which dialogues are often expressed through the voice of a single person rather than two or more.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"YWY, the Android","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4395851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahy Tentehar Guajajara","original_name":"Zahy Tentehar Guajajara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"YWY","credit_id":"690f0c34a4a1c96cc831a99f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1483465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isadora Neves Marques","original_name":"Isadora Neves Marques","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/42acuEUldDU1m3B4LYxaHI57TLy.jpg","credit_id":"690f0c58c49fa5cfa4dd1516","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1483465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isadora Neves Marques","original_name":"Isadora Neves Marques","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/42acuEUldDU1m3B4LYxaHI57TLy.jpg","credit_id":"690f0c6dcb8da97d83d2514f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1483465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isadora Neves Marques","original_name":"Isadora Neves Marques","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/42acuEUldDU1m3B4LYxaHI57TLy.jpg","credit_id":"690f0c7f83613852a2ce7f4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1483465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isadora Neves Marques","original_name":"Isadora Neves Marques","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/42acuEUldDU1m3B4LYxaHI57TLy.jpg","credit_id":"690f0c971655f14dc7ce8156","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2904929,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catarina de Sousa","original_name":"Catarina de Sousa","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f0ccf9f53be2e004c768f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5803623,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carolina Marsiaj Costa","original_name":"Carolina Marsiaj Costa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f0d18fe08b67726a0c05e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2516811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno da Luz","original_name":"Nuno da Luz","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f0d39804776dbe2d24fa7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
