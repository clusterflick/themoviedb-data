Prickly Mountain traces the radical design/build movement they sparked, uncovering how their scrappy, countercultural ethos reshapes architecture and continues to influence today. Filmed over nine years, the documentary weaves archival footage, present-day interviews, and the filmmaker’s personal journey to explore what it means to build a life — and a home — by hand.","popularity":0.1643,"poster_path":"/m0yOjSbLL22qn2gBkUDjIwgtWSr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":279645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allie Rood Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A feature documentary about a counter culture expression of architecture, and a girl who grew up in it.","title":"Prickly Mountain and My Design/ Build Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5581111,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oliver Dawe","original_name":"Oliver Dawe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690d2ccf78a31ad1cbdd0f12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3284191,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Allie Rood","original_name":"Allie Rood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690d2ceca473cfb67d31a277","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.763,"height":1698,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0yOjSbLL22qn2gBkUDjIwgtWSr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"World Premiere","release_date":"2025-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Prickly Mountain Official Trailer","key":"1125499443","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-10-08T11:45:40.000Z","id":"690d28d881395a6dd1d248fe"}]}}}
