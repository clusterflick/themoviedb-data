Decades later, fragments of her life and work resurface through obituaries and fading memories. In 2024, a modern composer seeks to rediscover and reinvent her lost opera, conversing with the echoes of the past to reclaim the Countess’s silenced voice and vision.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/1N6fYg69rgYElVgRNYusGny097U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131385,"logo_path":null,"name":"OperaVision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Juan no existe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Labourdette","original_name":"Natalia Labourdette","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vcDKr7dGUlZJbCumjvCmViQrbty.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carmen Díaz de Mendoza / Helena","credit_id":"690f5a503174b11fc0c05603","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Oller","original_name":"David Oller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Augustin / Don Juan","credit_id":"690f5a69dc7b73f47c31ab11","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo García-López","original_name":"Pablo García-López","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Miguel","credit_id":"690f5a875a3fee914dce8106","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804101,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Helena Cánovas","original_name":"Helena Cánovas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5aa581395a6dd1d2519d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Iglesias","original_name":"Alberto Iglesias","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5abc3a7b019fa89aba57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2667361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bárbara Lluch","original_name":"Bárbara Lluch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5accce9c1f48f79ab881","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4451535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jhoanna Sierralta","original_name":"Jhoanna Sierralta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5adebdfe22a7d8874856","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3620209,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Blanca Añón","original_name":"Blanca Añón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5aef91a3814cebdd1720","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804102,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Clara Peluffo Valentini","original_name":"Clara Peluffo Valentini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5afe1655f14dc7ce8300","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431136,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Urs Schönebaum","original_name":"Urs Schönebaum","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5b0e2768a98e62c05857","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5804103,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sixto Cámara","original_name":"Sixto Cámara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690f5b22965b35bb239ab9b7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":875,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1N6fYg69rgYElVgRNYusGny097U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":584}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER | DON JUAN NO EXISTE Helena Cánovas – Festival Perelada","key":"LSgbDW0-e1U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2025-11-04T21:46:26.000Z","id":"690f5c28d903591f1cc05666"}]}}}
