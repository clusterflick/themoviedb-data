With the assistance of his associate, Bill Shopps, Joe seeks to control the other investors' certificates. He travels to Spain, where he discovers that a partner named Garros has died. Joe kidnaps Garros' daughter, Rolande, and claims that she has also died. After Didier Bouchard, another member of the group, gathers the partners and their heirs together, Joe lures them into a building where, ostensibly, a sale of the land is to take place. Joe imprisons them, but they escape in time to attend the sale. An investor named Milo d'Espail learns that Rolande is still alive and rescues her from Joe. Bouchard marries Thérèse, another of Garros's daughters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Money Maniac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0012470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1921-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
