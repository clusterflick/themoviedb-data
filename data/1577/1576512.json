In the late 1970s and early 1980’s LGBTQ, BIPOC, and formerly abused women across the US gathered in secret to create a grassroots movement that became today's National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, despite persecution and death threats. Norma recounts to her daughter, director Nisha Burton, how she and her collaborators alerted the police of rising cases of domestic violence and ultimately decided to take matters into their own hands by conducting support gatherings in their homes around the kitchen table. These meetings led to the founding of the first battered women’s shelter in Tulsa, OK in 1975. The years that followed were filled with harassment and verbal and physical attacks on Norma and fellow organizers, but today these courageous advocates continue to support the movement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":279742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shrine13","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
