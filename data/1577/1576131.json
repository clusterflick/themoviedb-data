Secreted in the basement of the Lecture Hall building, the department found in the surrounding corridors a home, an architectural avatar, and a nigh-sacred site steeped in myths and anecdotes. Here, the basement is re-historicized through a contemporary gesture—not photographed, but scanned into a 3D model. An anamnesis arises within this reproduction: one that temporally belongs to the present yet ceaselessly gazes into the past, framing the “was” and “there” as objets d’art.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babylon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
