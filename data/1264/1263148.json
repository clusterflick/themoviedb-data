Gerd wants to become an electrician, but after several rejections he accepts an apprenticeship as a lathe operator at Ford. In the first two years he works in an apprentice workshop, in the third year he has to go into production; from now on he is under a lot of pressure, because the company keeps the decision as to whether to take on an apprentice as a normal employee open until the last moment. When Gerd talks about the apprenticeship at home and criticizes the training, his parents reprimand him. They say: You'd better put something away! He shouldn't stand out in the company. The work of a lathe operator is increasingly being taken over by automatic machines. Gerd realizes that he is learning a trade that no one will need any more soon.","popularity":0.0672,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31149,"logo_path":"/6WsIa6eOLAE4EgufvQHMRNvmrF.png","name":"Provobis Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steck lieber mal was ein - Ein Schüler wird Lehrling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerd Zahner","original_name":"Gerd Zahner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65fd9cbb197de40130148416","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietrich Schubert","original_name":"Dietrich Schubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9c8f197de4016315a464","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608644,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katharina Schubert","original_name":"Katharina Schubert","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9c8777070001490709bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608648,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ronald Wedekind","original_name":"Ronald Wedekind","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9cf1770700013006545e","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietrich Schubert","original_name":"Dietrich Schubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9c95197de4016315a46d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705102,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karsten Müller","original_name":"Karsten Müller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9cdc197de4018616a5e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Klein","original_name":"Wolfgang Klein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9d0b1b1f3c013095a089","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3270218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frieder Wagner","original_name":"Frieder Wagner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9ccc0929f6017e9a93a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608644,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katharina Schubert","original_name":"Katharina Schubert","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9c833520e8014bd50f34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608651,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Rudolf Perey","original_name":"Franz Rudolf Perey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9d1c378062017c380923","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608649,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manfred Rintelen","original_name":"Manfred Rintelen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9cfb3520e80165d59604","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968990,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elisabeth Förster","original_name":"Elisabeth Förster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9d281b1f3c016396b477","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ingeborg Janiczek","original_name":"Ingeborg Janiczek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd9d36226c5601646f00d5","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0391470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFF Berlin","release_date":"1980-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
