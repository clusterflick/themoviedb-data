Included are a unique Rembrandt - his only seascape - and a Vermeer considered the most valuable stolen painting in the world. The art was taken from the walls of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in the early hours of 18 March 1990. It remains the world’s biggest unsolved art heist. For John, to follow the recovery of the paintings, as it happens, would be the biggest art story of the century.","popularity":0.1316,"poster_path":"/aFapVBWIdeLD4rWL2oIa6QVLQTo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matchlight","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Billion Dollar Art Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4609229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wilson","original_name":"John Wilson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65fe06697f6c8d017c6f8b9f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568502,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eamon Hardy","original_name":"Eamon Hardy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fe06940929f601649a093e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Waldman","original_name":"Michael Waldman","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fe06b5378062017c385ba4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Hill","original_name":"Matthew Hill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fe06c7197de401861705ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31868533","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aFapVBWIdeLD4rWL2oIa6QVLQTo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10051,"name":"heist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
