The film is composed of three fragmented stories that depict a young girl in postwar Norway, a Japanese schoolgirl during World War II, and an androgen person in their twenties in a contemporary domestic setting. These three individuals belong to very different places and eras, and their stories are interwoven with a voiceoverâ€”the voice might belong to one of the characters on-screen, or all, or none. Scenes are depicted with close-up images, which alludes to a certain level of significance, as if they were hinges to memories, but the overall narrative remains tantalizingly elusive. Based on personal accounts of surviving trauma, the film uses fiction as a form for speculating about those events that might define a life, while simultaneously defying our ability to narrate them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/H7EfL5teP9dtEzaZGZF3iKRh8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All that goes before forget","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daisuke Kosugi","original_name":"Daisuke Kosugi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdb3fd90fca3014aa0613c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daisuke Kosugi","original_name":"Daisuke Kosugi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdb414770700017c0b0a4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daisuke Kosugi","original_name":"Daisuke Kosugi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdde7090fca3014aa06876","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22457088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mnRpbZ9SlwL72Ym3IKUlqWzh5b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svXx44E68DxBhzAoru4hMpe4Qk1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2122,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/H7EfL5teP9dtEzaZGZF3iKRh8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VOLT","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"All that goes before forget_teaser","key":"664278336","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-10T14:37:51.000Z","id":"65fdde4b90fca30164a072ad"}]}}}
