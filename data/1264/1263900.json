People are the rulers of the world, or are they just parasites on Earth? Let the air tell you.\r Husserl proposed that existence is an object requirement of consciousness. In the future, the consciousness of air will become a system that can be experienced, allowing humans to infiltrate it. However, the purpose of creating this system is to change who you are now.\r The film attempts to explore the balance between humans and nature, using speculative narrative techniques, replacing consciousness as the storyline, using quantum erasure experiments and Newtonian classical mechanics as theoretical basis, crossing the boundaries of reality and virtuality, and attempting to guide the audience to generate new perspectives on nature and behavior after visual experience.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qlIa75sJNxoG0bTrDyFjggLH813.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am Air","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qlIa75sJNxoG0bTrDyFjggLH813.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIRST青年电影展","release_date":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
