It consists of an in-frame monologue, live clips, contacts with relatives, colleagues and other people, archive videos and photos. Separate interviews with other professionals, friends and relatives are missing from the film. This gap is filled by live contacts, dialogues and “following scenes”. Maestro introduces himself in different environments, in each of them he talks about his memories and thinks about cultural issues. There are many archival videos in the film, some of which were left in the shadows for some reason, for many people they will be pleasant discoveries.","popularity":0.0496,"poster_path":"/3iopXdGdwAFBCHMWkXMrn5Uq60s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224256,"logo_path":"/xC5CvWQbEsfrn5tX1KrtVDsGzRa.png","name":"Order Film Production","origin_country":"AM"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Robert Amirkhanyan","title":"Robert Amirkhanyan: MY HEART","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Amirkhanyan","original_name":"Ռոբերտ Ամիրխանյան","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/3CtAFuP5EoIBW1SwUtMnGhvzBNh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"65fdd7b71b1f3c017c97c506","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3493254,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hayk Ordyan","original_name":"Hayk Ordyan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wlNOlRVBPepJtDiB44PqCrWSgsE.jpg","credit_id":"65fdd90e7707000149071993","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608984,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edgar Harutyunyan","original_name":"Edgar Harutyunyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdd83a60620a016327e13f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4608981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hayk Mkrtchyan","original_name":"Hayk Mkrtchyan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vc6we7G41nAXkXnoSfeYlXpxpBP.jpg","credit_id":"65fdd7da7707000130065ae3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608986,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Amirkhanyan","original_name":"Anna Amirkhanyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdd92962f335017d506393","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4608985,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sofya Hovhannisyan","original_name":"Sofya Hovhannisyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdd8fa0929f6016499fc7e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Selin","original_name":"Pavel Selin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8RlPxVLcCFMAQeHh12uDqwGPuGU.jpg","credit_id":"660161fa7f6c8d017c738024","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Amirkhanyan","original_name":"Ռոբերտ Ամիրխանյան","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/3CtAFuP5EoIBW1SwUtMnGhvzBNh.jpg","credit_id":"67485ad02a5622b105717f25","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"hy","file_path":"/1XXqk42IHYtqzI4LWCr7VpUy3J3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3iopXdGdwAFBCHMWkXMrn5Uq60s.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"«Սիրտն իմ.
