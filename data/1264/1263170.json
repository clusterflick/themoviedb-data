The soldiers violently soften the structure with shovels.  The wall of a large metal box slams down revealing Douglas MacArthur (played by Matthew Barney) smoking a large corncob pipe.  MacArthur wades through the petroleum jelly morass to a Japanese general wearing a top hat.  Both generals sign several white plastic tablets with inkless tattoo guns.  Over a bunsen burner, Barney heats up a branding iron bearing his insignia and presses it into each white tablet.  After each tablet has been signed and branded, Barbara Gladstone, who attends in period attire, ceremonially places a sticker label bearing the workâ€™s name, date, and Gladstone Gallery logo on each tablet.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/7cK5RIAOSofUV9ddklKPylHxjo9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Instrument of Surrender","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Drawing Restraint 13","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Douglas MacArthur","credit_id":"65fdabf17f6c8d017c6f3fed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Gladstone","original_name":"Barbara Gladstone","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65fdac070c1255017e0d223f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","credit_id":"65fdac170929f6017e9a9e23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1293,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7cK5RIAOSofUV9ddklKPylHxjo9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":862}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gladstone Gallery, NYC","release_date":"2006-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
