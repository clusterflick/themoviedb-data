In their present state, seen together and roughly the length of an average feature film, the two parts of MAGELLAN: AT THE GATES OF DEATH constitute perhaps the most gripping, monumental, and wrenching work ever executed on film...Frampton in 1971 began his filming of cedavers at the Gross Anatomy Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. He returned to the lab four times over the course of the next two years and then spent nine months assembling his 'forbidden imagery' into an extraordinary meditation upon death.\"â€“Bruce Jenkins","popularity":0.1554,"poster_path":"/2yjRy9KiwZkJH2lRryr3nHCmA0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Gate: Magellan at the Gates of Death, Part I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Red Gate, The (Magellan at the Gates of Death Part I)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Red Gate (Magellan at the Gates of Death Part I)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hollis Frampton","original_name":"Hollis Frampton","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/94kbHx8NNf5WlZZlq6F94coSmyL.jpg","credit_id":"65feefb3226c5601646fdd06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7502952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2yjRy9KiwZkJH2lRryr3nHCmA0O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":315517,"name":"16mm film"},{"id":329266,"name":"16mm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
