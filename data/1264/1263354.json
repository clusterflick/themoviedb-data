Rex","overview":"In this documentary, we go back to the beginning and tell the origin story of Scotty the T. Rex and how it was discovered on that fateful day in 1991. We also showcase the lasting impact the discovery had on the town of Eastend and the Paleo world in Canada. In 2019, Scotty was proclaimed the biggest in the world. Believed to be a female, she measured over 13 m or just over 42.6 feet long and weighed over 8.8 metric tons. Discovered in the dinosaur-rich Frenchman Formation, Scotty's bones have been carefully preserved and are stored at the T. Rex Discovery Centre in Eastend, Saskatchewan.","popularity":0.5876,"poster_path":"/5sUAuUQDmXPzeVHnJwnmlrUv0uP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Overtime Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":224287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southwest TV News","origin_country":""},{"id":224288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stealth Talon Aerial Photography & Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Biggest in the World","title":"The Story Of (Scotty) The T.
