Giant rats are clever and they learn fast. Their sense of smell is better than a dog's, they have more stamina, and they're a lot cheaper to train. This documentary follows \"Miss Marple\", who was born in a training lab and who goes through a year's training before being sent on her first mission to Mozambique. A shorter version (43 minutes) screened at festivals in 2009 but was never widely released.","popularity":0.3522,"poster_path":"/zn3AThvHIl1e56T00jvZt2IDDIi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86010,"logo_path":"/oRImGo0AVFXGirn8aLMDzHY5t6I.png","name":"Taglicht Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detecting Danger: Africa's Giant Rats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Solomon","original_name":"Andrew Solomon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6788996e3a43075f431d2cd4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Ostwald","original_name":"Herbert Ostwald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1Y2S7l3so5WE4KOMLe8ft4RGbP5.jpg","credit_id":"65fdea4660620a017c2a15e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Ostwald","original_name":"Herbert Ostwald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1Y2S7l3so5WE4KOMLe8ft4RGbP5.jpg","credit_id":"65fdea530c1255017e0d554f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roland Gockel","original_name":"Roland Gockel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdea6260620a016327e803","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4609065,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norbert Röttcher","original_name":"Norbert Röttcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdea7f60620a017c2a1605","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975478,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Stefan Kolbe","original_name":"Jan Stefan Kolbe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdea9462f335017d506b26","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975481,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Joggerst","original_name":"Mark Joggerst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdeaa31b1f3c016396dcbb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1893949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uli Veith","original_name":"Uli Veith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdeaef0c1255017e0d55d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1747837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernd Wilting","original_name":"Bernd Wilting","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdeb0262f335016450611f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xdYSc8iItlFym78z8vyERn7x24H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zn3AThvHIl1e56T00jvZt2IDDIi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1961,"name":"landmine"},{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
