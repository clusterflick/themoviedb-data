The risk of serious and possibly fatal injury looms with each buck and kick. For Liam Marshall, it’s a thrill he’s always known growing up in the Big Muddy Valley, in rural Saskatchewan. Training to compete and become a bareback champion requires his complete focus. It’s clear that it fills his every waking moment (when he’s not checking his cellphone). Surrounded by family and providing inspiration to his three younger brothers, this brave teenager holds on tight to a tradition that’s been passed down through generations.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/4sZi6P2aQth1Dfp6AAQ48zT1jUD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristin Catherwood","original_name":"Kristin Catherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ffb0c4b84cdd017df4ff2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristin Catherwood","original_name":"Kristin Catherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ffb0cb0c1255017e0f3ff2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810036,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Montes","original_name":"Jon Montes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ffb0db77070001630a069a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4611446,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aaron Munson","original_name":"Aaron Munson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ffb1050929f6017e9c67cf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670182,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew MacCormack","original_name":"Andrew MacCormack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ffb12504733f017ded48af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10049068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1674,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4sZi6P2aQth1Dfp6AAQ48zT1jUD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1144}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Yorkton Film Festival","release_date":"2018-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
