When films fail to include closed captions or subtitles I do not have full access to them due to my profound hearing loss. In the space of these absent captions I add my own captioned interpretations of the filmâ€™s plot. These descriptive captions include visual observations, plot assumptions/interpretations and also the thoughts that cross my mind as it wanders due to the boredom and strain of this event.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captioned","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4568239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liza Sylvestre","original_name":"Liza Sylvestre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fdbfb562f335014a505339","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
