By Tracey Emin","overview":"Why is it that art by male artists always sells for more than that of female artists? Is it subject matter? Is it machismo? Or is it plain old sexism? In this film, Tracey Emin crosses the country on a quest to find out. She meets artists such as Dame Maggi Hambling and Rachel Whiteread; curators such as Norman Rosenthal and gatekeepers such as Oliver Baker from Sotherby's? Have things changed? Or is it society that needs to change before the art market can follow?","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/sdiIbuV9R09Mtz10DVEKBBPRp4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Price Art?
