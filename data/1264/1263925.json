Far from the teeming cities and their overwhelming influence? Deliberately deprive oneself of mainland rhythms and access to anything, anywhere, any time? What an idea! And yet some have taken up the challenge. A crazy, offbeat, out of date challenge, or maybe one that is ahead of its time because life on an island is one that you create for yourself. Three new islanders realize that and have dropped anchor on Groix, an island in Brittany, rebellious but welcoming those who come to fulfill their project with an open heart: a doctor, because the island needs one; a divorced teacher who wants to rebuild her life; and an immigrant born of another Atlantic, who is so adaptable that he will be able to integrate. And so goes life on the island, which adopts unhesitatingly and offers its insularity as an identity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lQuZoSR0Z3pKvf0Oct9mAVKaVBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antipode","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ile de Groix from the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4611812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Bourges","original_name":"Christophe Bourges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660004350c1255017e0f832e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQuZoSR0Z3pKvf0Oct9mAVKaVBp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
