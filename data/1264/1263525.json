Performed by the Ensemble InterContemporain and conducted by Boulez, the intricate Répons was designed for an ensemble of twenty-four musicians, six soloists and a \"real-time\" digital processor. In Cahen's re-composed interpretation, he responds with visual and temporal transformations, \"opening\" the images in space and time and applying electronic techniques to engulf the instrumentalists in ocean, sky, and trees. Mirage-like superimpositions, temporal shifts, mirroring effects and de-synchronization result in a rhythmic confluence of the illusory and the real. Immersing the viewer in image and sound, Cahen mirrors the transformative process of Boulez's music.","popularity":0.2761,"poster_path":"/8VcH9qKBIgxmJEnVmZzhbcKVqgA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boulez-Répons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Répons di Boulez","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Boulez Repons","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Boulez","original_name":"Pierre Boulez","popularity":0.136,"profile_path":"/dmxEnwqbwt42vnl5LJozStS0GyR.jpg","credit_id":"65fed576770700017c0cb642","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":948114,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Baschet","original_name":"Marc Baschet","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fed54260620a016328a97e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Cahen","original_name":"Robert Cahen","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/FmOZh0dH1DeEDbja7brcmZxQgO.jpg","credit_id":"65fed45604733f017dec963c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Huter","original_name":"Stéphane Huter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fed5560c125501320a4114","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8VcH9qKBIgxmJEnVmZzhbcKVqgA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3537,"name":"orchestra"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Boulez Repons R Cahen","key":"272346511","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-29T11:53:22.000Z","id":"65fed628226c56017d709ac2"}]}}}
