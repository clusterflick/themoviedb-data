They are essential helpers for the growth of plants and crops that serve as food for other animals. During their development, people realized the importance of bees and have been involved in beekeeping since ancient times. Recently, however, bees have begun to die excessively for no apparent reason. The film addresses the dramatically deteriorating health of bee colonies and the unforeseeable consequences that bee mortality can have for our very existence. It seeks answers to the questions of what bees actually want to tell us and what significance bees have in the broader context of sustainability of life on Earth. To prevent such a catastrophe, our approach to beekeeping must be fundamentally changed. In this regard, the film offers many stimuli and inspiring examples from around the world.","popularity":0.3633,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vandana Shiva","original_name":"Vandana Shiva","popularity":0.2463,"profile_path":"/knwbovedVTC2cAEXjVLvRGWgrUa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61e84c61a1c59d006ebb480d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Pollan","original_name":"Michael Pollan","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/rumIWmiYXEs9uPkTQXhPrUClvKT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61e84c6957d3780116dfb8ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunther Hauk","original_name":"Gunther Hauk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xXFrnt6omltZjQHsIDdLbuCo3mP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61e84c713faba0006dbd6001","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1692141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Smith","original_name":"Jeffrey Smith","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61e84c83a9117f0091ff4f8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raj Patel","original_name":"Raj Patel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61e84c90394a8700c67b97f9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":97141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taggart Siegel","original_name":"Taggart Siegel","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e84c4ccd20460068ac8d37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
