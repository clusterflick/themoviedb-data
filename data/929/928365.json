In his first documentary, No U-Turn, he retraces the life-changing journey he made over 20 years ago. Along the way, he meets those who are taking the same trip and, through conversations with them, tries to understand what motivates young people today to expose themselves to the dangers of a passage into an uncertain future. Most are aware of the dangers of traveling undocumented by road, yet more and more are joining the ranks of those who take this risk. Overlaid with a powerful poetic commentary and insight into the long-reaching impact of a colonial past, this self-reflective travelogue unpacks the deep longing of an entire generation in search of opportunities.","popularity":0.1733,"poster_path":"/dcDH6vLw5aUw7LtqqAfycLndUfq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107429,"logo_path":"/yMkmYTkXjbelsnVMS1mGzeZLTBE.png","name":"STEPS","origin_country":"ZA"},{"id":116627,"logo_path":"/vPRSTPAj4WOLfKd3dmfPvmRsNF6.png","name":"Elda
