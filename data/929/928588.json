Then, in 1956, on the eve of his 18th birthday he crashed his car in a remote area of California and became a quadriplegic. In those days people with such severe injuries were only expected to live 10-15 years. To survive, mentally and physically, Gale set his mind to tackling small goals, focusing only on what he was able to do, and through a supportive family and church community, he rebuilt his life. He studied computer programming at UCLA in the 1960's, worked for an air defense company, married and adopted two children.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/bnvtR4dsdCrhOOEFBrHluXKyFJX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gale Williams","original_name":"Gale Williams","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61e75623b0ba7e0069729341","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Gillis","original_name":"Brenda Gillis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e7562d9a358d0044bb031a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630334,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Sanford","original_name":"Jonathan Sanford","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e75646bc8657009539779f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630334,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Sanford","original_name":"Jonathan Sanford","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63865b6d3d3557008407146a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bnvtR4dsdCrhOOEFBrHluXKyFJX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
