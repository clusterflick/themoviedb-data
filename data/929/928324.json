[...]  This documentary film follows five Berlin citizens of different backgrounds, countries, and diverse stories. They find themselves among almost two thousand similarly dedicated people to fight together for one cause.\r While their personal motivations differ, they all believe they can convince Berlin that the only way to make housing affordable again is to drive real estate companies out of their city.\r The stakes are high, the movement is strong. But with almost nothing in their hands, they have to prevail against an overwhelming opposition of the real estate lobby and politicians willing to sell out the city they call home.","popularity":0.2883,"poster_path":"/3A5F7Y2PNTIv5uHhBQCYW8tMErY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Purple","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Start Wearing Purple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2281431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leilani Farha","original_name":"Leilani Farha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Leilani Farha","credit_id":"6375fcdb5b2f47007fd5892f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3387865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M端ge S端er","original_name":"M端ge S端er","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e6af3890ea4b009cada602","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3387866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hendrik Kintscher","original_name":"Hendrik Kintscher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e6af47f3b49a006b05b50f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Start-Wearing-Purple-Dokumentarfilm-108035131600847","instagram_id":"startwearing.purple","twitter_id":""},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Tg4XVVVF53BdovGfUHL4jZGk4X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8uAhlj52g4aC3V34wvq9xz3jeKy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2362,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/3A5F7Y2PNTIv5uHhBQCYW8tMErY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1772}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":229177,"name":"housing crisis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
