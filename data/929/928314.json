La vera storia di Lidia Maksymowicz","overview":"Film tells the story of Lidia Maksymowicz, a two-year-old girl, who in 1942 was imprisoned in the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, where Dr. Mengele carried out his insane experiments on Jewish children. Her mother, forced to participate in a death march, swore to the child that one day she would return for her. Lidia, like all Auschwitz prisoners, was freed in January 1945 by Soviet soldiers and was given up for adoption to a Polish family. She lived out her youth thinking that her mother had died on a death march. But one day, in 1962, someone knocked at her door.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/cosj1Nqqw6l61if1ca15vB6Pe5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"70072: la bambina che non sapeva odiare.
