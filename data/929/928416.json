At the height of the Great White Hunter era, Edward turned his back on big game hunting and championed conservation instead. Inspired by his safari guide, Denys Finch-Hatton - played by Robert Redford in the Oscar winning film - he put down his rifle and picked up a movie camera, pioneering the photographic safaris we all know today.","popularity":0.0523,"poster_path":"/gT3jZ8lIPB9SQKTXnGifttarVMd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91541,"logo_path":"/whqhqLuLjcZpBo93WixhXPgjkTB.png","name":"Tigress Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward VIII: The Lion King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":182076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Boulter","original_name":"Russell Boulter","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/k7PNvYr0SgK7uxO6h2dP30kYNq5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66bc142e942a502e570e7ba0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4884497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Pagliero","original_name":"George Pagliero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bc144fe07c3f9104d04713","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2925156","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gT3jZ8lIPB9SQKTXnGifttarVMd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
