The footage was edited into a single piece for the first time in 1974, in time to show the work to the curator Barbara London, who was visiting Japan. Generations of his family were lost and gained that year, with Nakajima's mother passing away, and then his child was born. The piece is an installation with two monitors; the left presents his mother and himself, and the right, his child and himself. Nakajima continues to work on the sequels of \"My Life\" with his grandchild.","popularity":0.0953,"poster_path":"/Z2Fmez9oiIC5Y7h7GiAPBX84Jy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Nakajima","original_name":"中嶋興","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/4aMM6UYXI723t9qYcxoL3tqiw5U.jpg","credit_id":"61e68ad1f5c824001a186b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Z2Fmez9oiIC5Y7h7GiAPBX84Jy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
