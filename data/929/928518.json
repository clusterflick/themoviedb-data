Through a broad, whole-systems perspective, the film examines key challenges (climate change, inequities, species extinction, overconsumption, and more) and explores the deeper transformation being called forth from humanity. Woven throughout are stories from around the world illustrating both heart-breaking impacts and inspiring resilience. Engaging with this paradox — an unfolding global crisis paired with the opportunity to awaken to and serve the well-being of all of life — is the work of our lifetimes. The film features Duane Elgin, Victoria Santos, Jack Kornfield, Joanna Macy, Nate Hagens, Beena Sharma, Lynne Twist, and other contributors who are grappling with this paradox and offering guidance for navigating the times ahead.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/6exzgqbmiOQQAYfI4D2K7hG0SXF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Facing Adversity: Choosing Earth, Choosing Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Elgin","original_name":"Duane Elgin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61e72347df294500686bb6a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Coleen LeDrew Elgin","original_name":"Coleen LeDrew Elgin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e72352f0647c00deb98107","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Coleen LeDrew Elgin","original_name":"Coleen LeDrew Elgin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e723599ac53500e36e4721","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Elgin","original_name":"Duane Elgin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e723629a358d00927830cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833611,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Hollander","original_name":"Catherine Hollander","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e7236b746457001b01831b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577080,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katie Teague","original_name":"Katie Teague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e72376ea37e0004351b3e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6exzgqbmiOQQAYfI4D2K7hG0SXF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
