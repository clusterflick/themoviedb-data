It was the first time that followers of a sect, in this case the Order of the Solar Temple, committed suicide in France. This led the authorities to create an interministerial mission to fight against cults, which would become Miviludes. The investigation of the tragedy avoids another tragedy in the Canary Islands and shows everyone the danger of cults.","popularity":0.071,"poster_path":"/hXcsNcZYsMpfGfKPznF0igbIACT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85699,"logo_path":"/7F4qG35w4S9FOM5pXZolh2Vy7xp.png","name":"Premières Lignes","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secte du temple solaire - Vercors londe de choc","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthieu Lère","original_name":"Matthieu Lère","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e70b3e4975600097a11782","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marion Guegan","original_name":"Marion Guegan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e70b2e07a8080019b6e8fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18378252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Q4TNWtEbUcBHZop8xGk7MYqXo0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hXcsNcZYsMpfGfKPznF0igbIACT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wb4NFRrszpk1Gy0VJLoMawkAIiG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
