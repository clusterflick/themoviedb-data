The revolt began as a protest against university expansion into neighboring communities and its role as a slum lord. After five days of student control, the administrators and trustees ordered the police to clear the buildings. What resulted was an unprecedented display of brutality and repression. Narrated by one of the student rebels, the detailed eyewitness account of this event galvanized other campus revolts around the country.","popularity":0.327,"poster_path":"/yLYZwQGkrSR7w7lh8eplZsqMVVI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newsreel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Columbia Revolt (Newsreel #14)","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Newsreel","original_name":"Newsreel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64039ab639271200a9f32ecd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0346784","wikidata_id":"Q5149812","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yLYZwQGkrSR7w7lh8eplZsqMVVI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":168483,"name":"student protest"},{"id":208709,"name":"columbia university"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
