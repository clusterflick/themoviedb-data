His back is to the audience as he seemingly stares into the same view that we, the audience, see around him. There he stands, partially obscuring the image that is now projected over him. His body is almost still in contrast to the jerky, handheld footage which was filmed walking through what appears to be a cemetery. A second scene takes us down a long (underground?) corridor illuminated by strip lights. Throughout the film, the camera is in constant motion, penetrating forward, at times looking out from a moving vehicle. The sound we hear could simply be that of a running projector, but in combination with these murky images, a more ominous, foreboding atmosphere is implied.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z3Sxpy063kXoQaTVhKTKxFETC68.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XVIII/85 Untergrund","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1824907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","original_name":"Werner von Mutzenbecher","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z0HvKg68ujOW6NC0N17gln4eY8h.jpg","credit_id":"61e6f521c613ce0042281a48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z3Sxpy063kXoQaTVhKTKxFETC68.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
