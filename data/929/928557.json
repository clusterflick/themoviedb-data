In this profoundly personal mixed media experience inside the ADHD mind, Neurodivergent follows the filmmaker’s journey as she discovers her ADHD diagnosis during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. When she turns the camera on herself and her family to process what this diagnosis means, she also discovers why so many women with ADHD are undiagnosed and the dire consequences on their lives.","popularity":0.2963,"poster_path":"/hcFjZsZHlIjnKclWHlFryyHPay6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neurodivergent","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Afton Quast Saler","original_name":"Afton Quast Saler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e7417ddf294500433b25db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388510,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Priebe","original_name":"Rachel Priebe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741863faba000453bb568","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388511,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Reagan Shea","original_name":"Reagan Shea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e7418ea9117f004431c298","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388512,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yifan Yin Haung","original_name":"Yifan Yin Haung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741999a358d00c1124eb6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388514,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rebecca Grass","original_name":"Rebecca Grass","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741a49a358d0092786cf0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388515,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kaitlin Peters","original_name":"Kaitlin Peters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741acf0647c011410f991","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1955219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Taylor","original_name":"Sydney Taylor","popularity":0.5365,"profile_path":"/r53NwdRM2uDvXV6c0391AcLsrky.jpg","credit_id":"61e741b8ea37e001142f70b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Johnson","original_name":"Scott Johnson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741c47648410043081250","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Eve","original_name":"Alice Eve","popularity":4.3625,"profile_path":"/tJUSx0Cw7pCnRsCWbGTX2POiTKM.jpg","credit_id":"61e741d43faba0001d39d6d0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388512,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yifan Yin Haung","original_name":"Yifan Yin Haung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741e0bc86570068fa1b70","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388517,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kelsey Kent","original_name":"Kelsey Kent","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e741e9944a57001c679344","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14972728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"neurodivergent.documentary","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hcFjZsZHlIjnKclWHlFryyHPay6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Salute Your Shorts Film Festival, Los Angeles","release_date":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Neurodivergent Trailer.mp4","key":"752682820","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-22T19:29:32.000Z","id":"640aa0b4caaca2008f0a745c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Neurodivergent Clip 2","key":"752677953","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-22T19:16:03.000Z","id":"640aa101caaca2008f0a74a1"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Neurodivergent Clip 1","key":"752677934","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-22T19:16:00.000Z","id":"640aa0ed3a4a1200b6ea8b0d"}]}}}
