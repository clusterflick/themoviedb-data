In the form of a letter addressed to her daughter, Nadine Trintignant offers, eighteen years after her death, an intimate, fair and deeply moving portrait of this free-spirited and stubborn child of the ball, who, by starring alongside Patrick Deweare, Isabelle Huppert and Marcello Mastroianni, and shooting under the direction of Alain Corneau, Claude Chabrol, Pierre Salvadori and Samuel Benchetrit, left her burning imprint on cinema and theater alike.  Archival footage, film and stage extracts provide a luminous account of the all-too-short life of this energetic woman, mother, actress and author.","popularity":0.1092,"poster_path":"/1JaCObM8B1ybtg4zvssJpmKDRuG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80138,"logo_path":"/sfVmSNU1aq6g6zZ7DsdPYIHqZ3R.png","name":"CPB Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marie Trintignant, tes rêves brisés","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Trintignant","original_name":"Marie Trintignant","popularity":1.035,"profile_path":"/7jgksCx4EcrZsDmPfPzAZkriya8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"61f27abb0284200094590ede","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1180610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine Trintignant","original_name":"Nadine Trintignant","popularity":0.5408,"profile_path":"/miK6h3RNy6DNjUxGiWJo9gK2ghH.jpg","credit_id":"61e7f0ef57d3780043ec51ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17446552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/a6bGfz3u3965i6zQ4kgscZSCt2L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1JaCObM8B1ybtg4zvssJpmKDRuG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
