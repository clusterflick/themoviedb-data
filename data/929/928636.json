A quick review of both the regular season and the playoffs shows how the Broncos reached the final game against the Green Bay Packers and emerged with an easy win. The film pays special tribute to Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback John Elway, both long time NFL bridesmaids who had come close to a Super Bowl win on several occasions but had never accomplished the task. Running back Terrell Davis, the game's MVP, is also profiled, along with defensive standouts Neil Smith and Alfred Williams. The victory was the first for the Broncos organization.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/3djmVLZEK3qjEiVBxLGJnxcpyjW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3232,"logo_path":"/8KtxMsWLOK6zDTNAfi75yg2QvSt.png","name":"NFL Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Bowl XXXII: The Best One Ever","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3djmVLZEK3qjEiVBxLGJnxcpyjW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
