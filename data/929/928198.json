We are 7 years later. Lucas and Maurice have never seen each other again and have no contact since the tragic events of the BIZARRE cabaret in New York. Lucas now lives in Denver, Colorado. He is married to a slightly older man who is the father of a 16-year-old child. In the middle of this peaceful life, Maurice will again cross paths with Lucas. As another tragic event takes place in Denver, Maurice and Lucas will have only one solution, to flee towards San Francisco through the American West.","popularity":0.504,"poster_path":"/gWpEhLGY8xnJBmN3YLD1uzjGUoZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72943,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bushwick
