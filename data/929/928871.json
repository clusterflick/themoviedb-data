Silent Song completes a deeply personal trilogy on family history and Holocaust memory. The first two films of the trilogy, Zyklon Portrait (13min. 1999) and The Walnut Tree (11min. 2000) have been seen in 20 countries around the globe, garnering numerous awards.  In the pandemonium of the liberation of Nazi concentration camp Dachau, a U.S. army cameraman filmed a young boy playing the accordian. This strangely poetic moment offers an unusual contrast to the all-too-familiar WWII liberation images of emaciated prisoners in striped uniforms.  Silent Song is a contemplation on the ephemeral nature of life, images and history. This fleeting moment was recorded and thus became an object - the film that is now part of the United States national Archives. The intrinsic human need to photograph and archive is brought to light - the boyâ€™s dark eyes and his gentle smile become palpable.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0318695","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
