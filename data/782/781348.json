Jordan's story is told principally through a chronological narration of his life and accomplishment, most of it taken from recent (2019) interviews with and narration by Jordan himself. His early life in Atlanta is limned, where Jordan describes the treasured influence of his mother Mary and his early academic successes (including a law degree from Howard University). His activities in the civil rights movement in the 1960's and 1970's are highlighted, culminating in his ten-year tenure as director of the Urban League.","popularity":0.0862,"poster_path":"/jMah2taxdrOMuJzETK4eFxvT2IW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vernon Jordan: Make it Plain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawn Porter","original_name":"Dawn Porter","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":"/7K7vVWa72eqe7b9bp0ayJL7ExMe.jpg","credit_id":"5fed3874a44d09003f7ace8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13678498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMah2taxdrOMuJzETK4eFxvT2IW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
