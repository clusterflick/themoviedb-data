Telling the story of the exceptional treasures of the National Library of France is like opening a great history book rich in many twists and turns. Without the love of the kings of France for books and precious objects, this institution would never have seen the light of day. The story begins in the 14th century under the reign of a passionate writer, Charles V, who set up a library in his apartments in the Louvre. But it was not until the 17th century, and the reign of Louis XIV, a lover of the arts and letters, that the royal library took over its historic quarters in the rue Vivienne in Paris, which it still occupies.","popularity":0.5581,"poster_path":"/veqVDkR5kjeks9PSTrcKVT8074m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110369,"logo_path":"/girzZNbsSO1uJ4NTfKjRx3PWW8l.png","name":"Martange
