He alone represents a history of French cinema without having spent his time cultivating its legend. He crossed his century as an actor with the modesty of a craftsman. He believed in learning, know-how and transmission. He considered himself, like the butcher or the cabinetmaker, as a man useful to his fellow men. Bernard Blier found in Louis Jouvet, who was his teacher at the Conservatory, a master at playing, a mentor and even a spiritual father. Jouvet taught Blier the love of acting, theater and Molière. And if he knew how to take hold of Michel Audiard's best tirades like no one else, notably those of the \"Tontons Flingueurs\", it is to this apprenticeship that he owes it.","popularity":0.4271,"poster_path":"/bFIzol4vXhNdwZoNjMY4TpDVqFK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernard Blier, façon puzzle","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Blier","original_name":"Bernard Blier","popularity":0.7069,"profile_path":"/6xRHGb7CNDa83rcTzCp3LeIvU2s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6766f320330bce6ec9910b06","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christophe Duchiron","original_name":"Christophe Duchiron","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef6b4885702e004093645c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christophe Duchiron","original_name":"Christophe Duchiron","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef6b53140bad003ca54d59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Philippe Guerand","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Guerand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef6b6a4a4bf6003ed5e63d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13719698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xW8mSwAsHTiy33Mw2iCW8HvXQBH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bFIzol4vXhNdwZoNjMY4TpDVqFK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":213803,"name":"french cinema"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":225690,"name":"quest for knowledge"},{"id":281588,"name":"traditional values"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
