His large oils are treasured by collectors worldwide. It was director Ben Shani's encounter with one of Shamir's works that spawned the idea of documenting the artist at work. Neither of them had any idea that everything would change as the filming progressed, as an unforeseen danger threatened to rob Shamir of his talent. Filmed over the course of ten years, A lullaby for the Valley focuses on the fascinating figure of Eli Shamir and his paintings. As time passes, like the endless fields of the valley, they are transformed before our very eyes.","popularity":0.0937,"poster_path":"/A3hcM4zlqRCW58T8Q8CDv7Dqnwf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138118,"logo_path":"/xCpJDiJnP4L0sCROqcCwo02hQzH.png","name":"Donna & Shula Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lullaby for the Valley","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125555,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ady Cohen","original_name":"Ady Cohen","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/5Sy7NfyK02s7zq6dCkKAYTAGHi1.jpg","credit_id":"61e6f7d87d2bc1009fd403df","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2681155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shula Spiegel","original_name":"Shula Spiegel","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec95a3945d36003c071ebd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2916817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Shani","original_name":"Ben Shani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec953c1d1bf4003c13f56c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1946838,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dana Eden","original_name":"Dana Eden","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec95771d1bf4003e14e76b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uriel Sinai","original_name":"Uriel Sinai","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec95d1a5d849003ee5d8b0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2916817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Shani","original_name":"Ben Shani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec951caa659e003eeecd74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703587,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ron Omer","original_name":"Ron Omer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec95e707a808003f942a12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13038108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A3hcM4zlqRCW58T8Q8CDv7Dqnwf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Hebrew\", \"english_name\"=>\"Hebrew\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"he\", \"native_name\"=>\"Hebrew\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
