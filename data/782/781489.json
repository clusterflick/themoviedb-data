He's perhaps still best known as the king of the game shows, having hosted over a dozen different formats in his career, from The Golden Shot and Family Fortunes to Bob's Full House and Wipeout.  But his first and enduring love was his work as an accomplished stand-up comedian, and his was a career devoted to making audiences laugh. We focus on Bob's work as a stand-up comedian: he was a consummate professional, with each joke in every performance meticulously prepared. Despite the many changes in style and taste in comedy during his lifetime, Monkhouse always managed to adapt his material and performance technique, moving with the times and so remaining popular with audiences throughout his long career.","popularity":0.3859,"poster_path":"/cbQdIQx5vIf8RTS6yNKTGekiRQ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Yellow","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bob Monkhouse: Master of Laughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Monkhouse","original_name":"Bob Monkhouse","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/hlFCW6DyaGJmKI1C7wIs5sktA1i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61aeda6135811d006188b8c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Culshaw","original_name":"Jon Culshaw","popularity":0.2717,"profile_path":"/3ilYt3ksQIOVTqqDp2EDvK32Wz5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61aeda706dea3a004141d97c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Wells","original_name":"Mark Wells","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61aedbaee263bb0064767d23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Worster","original_name":"Luke Worster","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61aedb4ff8aee8005f700d04","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338819,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick J.
