As in a vision, the story shifts back forty years and discloses the interior of an orphan asylum. Three babies are there, two boy babies and one baby girl, awaiting adoption into a good home. Years pass and the orphaned children have grown up in three different homes. Miss Leonard's dearest treasures are a pair of tiny baby shoes and a faded plaid shawl given to her foster parents by the asylum nurse.","popularity":0.1578,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rose of Yesteryear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fecf14a22af3e0040d14a6c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362368,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanner E.V.
