On the Grand Banks, the Ocean Ranger, the world's mightiest drilling rig, is pounded by waves more than 20 metres high. At the height of the storm, the \"indestructible\" rig begins to tip over, then capsizes. All 84 men on board -- 56 of them from Newfoundland -- perish. It is Canada's worst tragedy at sea since the Second World War.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ocean Ranger Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Rowley","original_name":"Christopher Rowley","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef7030140bad003da4d157","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0368096","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
