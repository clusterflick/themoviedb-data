The girls are portrayed in their homes, together with the strongest supporters of their emancipation through education: their mothers.  Girls of Hope portrays five girls who struggle for their education and, despite all the difficulties, try to hold on to their hope for a better future.","popularity":0.336,"poster_path":"/9uJwaKH5jNGszmB4v2J8P6qlTa0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Notus
