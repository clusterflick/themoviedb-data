The father is very friendly with the neighboring Indian tribe and is presented with a quaint piece of metal representing a dragon's claw, the tribe's good luck omen. Some time later, while traveling with his daughter, he is held up by a band of bandits and shot dead. A bandit takes from him this dragon's claw. Years pass. The little girl has grown into a beautiful young lady. She marries. Their love is very real and their life most happy. He decides to go out west to see a mine that yields the richest gold and his wife expresses a desire to go along with him. The mine is christened \"The Dragon's Claw,\" because of an Indian charm the man owns. While out on a western desert, he shows the dragon's claw to his wife. She then recognizes it as the kind her father possessed when he was killed. She has understood it to be the only one of its kind. She now believes it is her husband who killed her father.","popularity":0.3266,"poster_path":"/m6fqf4ojKcAYJJejm8oNNA3zyy4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dragon’s Claw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fecf4350fb398003fbc9332","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Hampden","original_name":"Walter Hampden","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/wgkxdLPLCcqfSvjGCaFTqVeE7c4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fecf440ede1b0003e63d7e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","original_name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/tFmOBk854vXe5dbeO9faNFPBy6j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fecf452c4ad590040e8b97f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362368,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanner E.V.
