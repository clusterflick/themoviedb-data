The Prairies are singled out because of their proximity to huge stockpiles of intercontinental ballistic missiles located in North Dakota. Scenes include a visit to a missile base and to an emergency government bunker in Manitoba. A doctor, a farmer and a civil defence coordinator provide different perspectives on nuclear war. Although the film focuses on one region, it provides a model for people everywhere who would like to know more about their own situation but don't know what questions to ask.","popularity":0.505,"poster_path":"/5HOjfplJ2riu9galhNMOMNC6ObO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Big One: Nuclear War on the Prairies","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3665550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Richardson","original_name":"Brian Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62fae90d5cd16e007f9ad0e3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665548,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg White","original_name":"Greg White","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fae892ffc9de007a116c03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Starr","original_name":"Richard Starr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fae8196e938a007f64c2dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053047,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Matilainen","original_name":"Ben Matilainen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fae859839d930082306361","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665547,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Place","original_name":"Ron Place","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fae868258823007a7befec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665549,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Donahue","original_name":"Dan Donahue","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fae8a96e938a0091e1a9e6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael J.F.
