If we talk about blues as all this, then Vili Fajdiga's life was a typical blues one. At that time (1920), in Zasavje and Trbovlje, similar social conditions were evidently established as in the American Mississippi Delta, necessary for the birth of blues music. This is a story about a difficult and varied life, creativity, passion, hope, about falls and not always ups and downs, about love for a woman, for music, for life.","popularity":0.0628,"poster_path":"/26uHgLpvYtVa795DhIrLBLTH7qJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9083,"logo_path":"/quR737UI5ZVNGfhSKyx5rMWUyJo.png","name":"Staragara","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black District Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","title":"Za fuk pa špila gramofon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522826,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iztok Kovač","original_name":"Iztok Kovač","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63020fbbb39e35007a8573a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoran Poznič","original_name":"Zoran Poznič","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63020fccdfe31d0092049917","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dejan Knez","original_name":"Dejan Knez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63020fd7839d93008b614c4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrej Guček","original_name":"Andrej Guček","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63020fe5f056d50079935df6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1853678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Jani Novak","original_name":"Ivan Jani Novak","popularity":0.0438,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63021011fb52990082815b4f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomaž Domicelj","original_name":"Tomaž Domicelj","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63021029dfe31d0092049942","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrej Šifrer","original_name":"Andrej Šifrer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6302103196e30b007fdf23d8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jani Guna","original_name":"Jani Guna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6302103a33a376007a446442","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roman Uranjek","original_name":"Roman Uranjek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63021041839d93007e4c7401","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tine Gorjup","original_name":"Tine Gorjup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63021049dfe31d0092049954","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3667364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Kreže","original_name":"Benjamin Kreže","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fcfc7e62f33500986efa6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3667364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Kreže","original_name":"Benjamin Kreže","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fcfc76209f18007fdcecb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/26uHgLpvYtVa795DhIrLBLTH7qJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Released sometime in 2017","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
