Due to the EU’s programme for reducing finishing cutters, Alexander agreed to have his ship destroyed… The day after the destruction Alexander starts building a new boat. A year later it is ready. Dimitar has spent 45 years at sea. In 1987 he bought a VHS Camcorder and for years recorded the life on the ships around the world. Hristo’s fishing vessel is taken in 2012, near to the Romanian coast, on charges of poaching. The lawsuits go on for years. Zoya and Plamen are teachers. To survive on their meager salaries they have been going out to sea in their fishing boat to catch rapa whelks for years. The wife is the captain of the boat, Plamen is the diver, who looks for whelks.","popularity":0.1215,"poster_path":"/jA7BYyiYp5Ck0VvUZKIpjSShcUf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74786,"logo_path":"/6nvsBCFjBi7ExgArmw05tUw9YpL.png","name":"Argo Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2016-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailor Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandar Trapchev","original_name":"Alexandar Trapchev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"647603fac2823a012769f2e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitar Avrionov","original_name":"Dimitar Avrionov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6476040b6743fa00df86bce2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hristo Spasov","original_name":"Hristo Spasov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64760418dd258900c3253b13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandar Spasov","original_name":"Alexandar Spasov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64760433963864011848334b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plamen Kostovi","original_name":"Plamen Kostovi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6476044c1bf266043ecde7f8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Hristov","original_name":"Georgi Hristov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64760478dd258901200601ff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitar Dimitrov","original_name":"Dimitar Dimitrov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6476048d924ce600a75e03d7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Komandarev","original_name":"Stephan Komandarev","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/hRagEZFrTB214FdMvQ5zVy0TGp1.jpg","credit_id":"62fb895f175051007c59eca8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Veselin Hristov, Delyan Georgiev","original_name":"Veselin Hristov, Delyan Georgiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6476037c96386401184832da","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d3enjtwpw9Ov01bjuPVZ02CX9mr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cbJfyWYkQ3S5JuVKaLpFFtTe4Qt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCbQH8slmYKOCbXDs4lGCEfDIhd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oQgzo1woaC6U8CgPd27taBha7Z6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jA7BYyiYp5Ck0VvUZKIpjSShcUf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nHAqJXXe5Jtb9FuAhcy1N3pf3vu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bg","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
