These effects can sometimes be seen in physical appearances and can even manifest in violent tendencies. As these children grow up, the tendencies become more uncontrolled, leading to difficulties fitting into society.  This film explores the lives of 4 adolescents with FASDs and the effects that prenatal alcohol exposure has had, and continues to have, on their journeys to finding independence, fulfillment, and understanding the world around them.","popularity":1.1381,"poster_path":"/u5zK9WQyEFCdQrtqE9I68Setjvf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moment to Moment: Teens Growing Up with FASDs","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3664745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabe Chasnoff","original_name":"Gabe Chasnoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fa425c7eb5f200830bac91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3664745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabe Chasnoff","original_name":"Gabe Chasnoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fa42661cac8c007a30b422","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4179526","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u5zK9WQyEFCdQrtqE9I68Setjvf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190518,"name":"special needs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Moment to Moment: Growing Up with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders","key":"kfyYUq1yjTk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-06-03T19:19:17.000Z","id":"62fa429c1cac8c007a30b439"}]}}}
