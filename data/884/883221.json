Jak nie być innym","overview":"In a small Polish town, a young Tatar man is entering adulthood navigating between his Muslim community and local peers, between his mother and his girlfriend. He lives in a small town of Sokółka in the Podlasie region, in a remote corner of Catholic Poland, one of the most mono-ethnic countries in the world. Omar is a normal teenager, but at the same time he is also different – by religion, heritage, and looks. We watch him as he straddles the different parts of his identity as they become increasingly difficult to keep together; in the background, we witness the struggles of a community to remain distinct and survive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Omar.
