Using the special case of continuous lateral movement created from filming from a moving train, the film trails and loops across the screen, revealing the passing landscape. Filmed from the passenger compartment of the Berlin Ring-Bahn, the extended vision of the scenery includes surreptitious graffiti, elongated buildings, and a spatially compressed, passing train. The musical accompaniment is constructed from the original audio and created through the manipulation of delay-effect frequencies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/t5zhnTUYZlXf9bwOLtRFJaaGDts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Loops: Savignyplatz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Moser","original_name":"Jeffrey Moser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6163e13162fcd3008a094d6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t5zhnTUYZlXf9bwOLtRFJaaGDts.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
