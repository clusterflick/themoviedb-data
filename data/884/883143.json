Inside, a young man and woman sit on the floor, and a group of barefoot women preside over the scene from atop a wobbly desk. A divorce negotiation is underway. Overseeing the paperwork of a couple's separation is 63 year-old Khatoon. Few years prior, she opened the first Women's Sharia Court in India. Fed-up with the traditional all-male Muslim councils whose interpretations of Islamic law have discriminated against women, she decided to train herself as an Islamic judge to give women a space for seeking justice. Every day, she welcomes couples in crisis. She listens as they narrate their conflicts before offering advice. Glowering under their veils, the women plaintiffs are indignant and brave. In the form of a courtroom drama, this filmic chronicle showcases the strength with which Khatoon handles, with poise and breathtaking calm, these intense demonstrations of emotions.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":154747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hutong Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Sarkash: Women's Sharia Court","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Beneath Her Feet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3265330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Schrago","original_name":"Sophie Schrago","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616297cb18b75100298f8b75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013756,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pauline Tran Van Lieu","original_name":"Pauline Tran Van Lieu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789c81ae98081f582979f1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Rego","original_name":"Lucie Rego","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789c82be98081f582979f30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2159068,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oh Hee-jung","original_name":"오희정","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789c83aa64feb16c91d6fef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kang Sarah","original_name":"Kang Sarah","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789c84094d95839f3ad4a47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
