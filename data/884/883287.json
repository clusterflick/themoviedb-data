It brings together interviews conducted in 2002 with Henri Alleg, editor of the daily newspaper Alger Républicain from 1951 to 1955, and Pierre Vidal-Naquet, historian and essayist. It also features incredible statements from General Massu and lawyers unraveling the various legal defenses of people like Jean-Marie Le Pen. Not only does Moïra have her father, René Vautier, speak, but she also includes footage he himself filmed forty years earlier. A very interesting report, which notably reminds us that the Amnesty is not a pardon but the erasure of the sentence and also of the crime itself.","popularity":0.1537,"poster_path":"/ncw2ezVrMV7M5fuem6qaPn2jpRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34935,"logo_path":"/4JDPygYD7c8ZKXyD5zj9U1j3IvM.png","name":"La Fémis","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Law of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"قانون الصمت","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"قانون الصمت","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"قانون الصمت","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","title":"قانون الصمت","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61630834b865eb0025379d73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Alleg","original_name":"Henri Alleg","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/4IpxgOFYnYTxuzU19gaczuHhaM1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6163085ccee4810043b46dec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3265738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Vidal-Naquet","original_name":"Pierre Vidal-Naquet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/y7scqVUtiEMZ2HADZ6dHNu4befc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6163084bb865eb0025379dae","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2545384,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Moïra Chappedelaine-Vautier","original_name":"Moïra Chappedelaine-Vautier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xJVuIRFfDo2xxum8roRWZ8VZdzZ.jpg","credit_id":"61630826873f00004232566b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421455,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raoul Seigneur","original_name":"Raoul Seigneur","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807a599276bf64e41ab08dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5388379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Zibat","original_name":"Nadia Zibat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807a5aac3e8e74b6dee9e5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5388379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Zibat","original_name":"Nadia Zibat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807a5b0276bf64e41ab08e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2545384,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Moïra Chappedelaine-Vautier","original_name":"Moïra Chappedelaine-Vautier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xJVuIRFfDo2xxum8roRWZ8VZdzZ.jpg","credit_id":"6807a5b8c3e8e74b6dee9e68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421455,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raoul Seigneur","original_name":"Raoul Seigneur","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807a5c8c3e8e74b6dee9e6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11405432","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lJaasocB2YfkoqlnypcmPD1NS1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1276,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncw2ezVrMV7M5fuem6qaPn2jpRG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1327,"name":"war crimes"},{"id":15108,"name":"justice"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"},{"id":350766,"name":"rené vautier"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
