All three films explore the domestic life of a cultural, intellectual couple, Christian and Michael, a museum curator and an artist. In \"Christian and Michael\", the couple is at home in their apartment in Vienna, Austria, in the same apartment building where Christian grew up, a building that the family has owned since the aught years of the 20th century. Their space is surrounded by contemporary art as well as antiques and found objects. The interior is a form of self expression; the camera searches through the settings almost as a separate character, observing how space is filled and used, how culture is not left in the museum or office, but brought home as part and parcel of their daily lives. This film is in color, more essential to the lush yet modernistic environment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christian and Michael","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adele Friedman","original_name":"Adele Friedman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616231789d592c00441aa80d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
