Simon Gronowski and Koenraad lost almost everything in World War II, but they found each other. Lawyer Simon Gronowski was the sole survivor in his family during the Holocaust. The family of artist Koenraad Tinel passionately adhered to Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich. The Jewish boy and the Nazi child became friends in their old age; close as brothers. Their disarming brotherhood means everything to Simon and Koenraad themselves and is a message of hope and reconciliation for all of us.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quatre-mains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13311664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
