But with a home in northern Georgia, their village is close to the troubled border with the Russian-backed region of Abkhazia, where new conflicts have been rumbling for 30 years. Soso is a retired engineer, but together with his wife Nino and their sons Giorgi and Lazare, he throws himself into the ‘Plant the Future’ programme set up by the Georgian authorities to stabilise the area. Nino is haunted by memories of the war and dreams of her children experiencing the world, while Soso wants to maintain their connection to the land. But Giorgi and Lazare long for a different future, immersing themselves in anime and dreaming of visiting Japan. In the midst of their daily lives, the family navigates between hardship, joy and contemplation of a different future.","popularity":0.0708,"poster_path":"/vY0Alsgl7O2RKqWbK1FyNlCPxJy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2024-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blueberry Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"Cadillac Dreams","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3265323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elene Mikaberidze","original_name":"Elene Mikaberidze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6162967f21621b002db14dc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1500589,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Truc","original_name":"Isabelle Truc","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f9ec043638f9373004e07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122626,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elene Margvelashvili","original_name":"Elene Margvelashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f9ea9cfd49d019e68d822","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4278373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Baptiste Brunner","original_name":"Baptiste Brunner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f9ed0d956c67aa7004e07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3265323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elene Mikaberidze","original_name":"Elene Mikaberidze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665f9e98e1b697234d004d7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32133451","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5lQoN0ZVzZPloZgqsrs4Hx3QEkn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9kFeGtgr06bhHbz8DBd8Og9s0SQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c0u7Tfu2QEpRZ5KL7DsuFsCjbfv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c5XuNdMruyMzBIx8Cf6jfTCThze.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3OFiR2jHf7Ye3Q8HaaYrYdPsRVG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nQNfjUqE1NViqHhsVfXFUrWd6Bk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4nqkyy0Jc6Fqa20h6yWbe0pIug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rn5s5fnGB38TlqvIroXY2QXnPoV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vY0Alsgl7O2RKqWbK1FyNlCPxJy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Blueberry Dreams (Lurji Motsvi) | Official Trailer | Coming soon to Klassiki","key":"WjoQMePPwn4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-12T12:01:04.000Z","id":"67fcee33c1e0a708cbad140d"}]}}}
