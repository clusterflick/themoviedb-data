I have known Miles since 1985, when I first screened with Scratch Projection and began distributing my films with Light Cone. This film portrays Miles and Yves in their eclectic home and garden. The home physically reveals layers of its history, while the garden is reminiscent of gardens across the channel, in Wales.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles and Yves, Indre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2021559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miles McKane","original_name":"Miles McKane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kfyfKah6ujBthW5PiBdewbgWGOe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6162311393828e002ad400c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adele Friedman","original_name":"Adele Friedman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616231238c40f7004342046e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
