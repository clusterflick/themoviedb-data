Soon after, the Dialo family, friendly Africans, moved into the adjoining house. At first, the two families get along perfectly. The only problem was that the Dialos organized many parties, which often ended late at night. The patience and understanding of the Marchands only delay the inevitable conflict.","popularity":0.4914,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162406,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICT Nelka
