In the beginning, she is alone in her apartment. It seems that she is going through a separation from her beloved person (a female). She is trying to cope with this loss by reading (a book by Renée Vivien and a poem by Goethe), moving around things in the apartment, thinking about the lost person. As the day ends and night falls, a nightmare-like vision haunts her - and a new path of hope opens up. This is the primary story of the film, told in a particular way, by means of storyboard and off-narration, inspired by the works of Marina Abramovic, Chantal Akerman, Guy Gilles and Chris Marker.","popularity":0.1178,"poster_path":"/chRey4t0CPRe4nI5Bur8Aa6hBH6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart through Deserts Runs -
