Marietta is the mother of Christian, and lives in Vienna, Austria, in the same apartment building as Christian and Michael, where Christian grew up. Marietta's apartment is a very different style from Christian and Michael's space. \"Marietta\" was filmed in black and white, which suits the interior of mementos and heirlooms, family portraits and souvenirs of eras past. Yet Marietta is extremely energetic and contemporary in her approach to life. The camera takes part as a character, moving and exploring the interior with Marietta as she moves through the space, interacting with the family in the present and in the past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marietta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adele Friedman","original_name":"Adele Friedman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616232a99ca75900895c6e4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
