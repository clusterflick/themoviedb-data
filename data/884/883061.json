Fiction and documentary collide in this gripping film as “scenes” from the main subject’s life are re-enacted for the camera. What emerges is a remarkable encounter with a young woman, and a story that has broader implications about being young, being at the cusp of adulthood, and finding one’s identity; about how documentaries reveal, provoke and conceal.","popularity":0.1108,"poster_path":"/cLcfn74CJmMSTUU4DTM48tNBJ5U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closer","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Gharavi","original_name":"Tina Gharavi","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616243fa4df2910029c3bf85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0350722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":885,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cLcfn74CJmMSTUU4DTM48tNBJ5U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":597}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
