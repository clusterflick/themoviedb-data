The show 'Spaak' was supposed to be a show about the brother of the grandmother of Raf and Mich Walschaerts. He died in a fatal accident in the twenties of the last century when he demarcated from the peloton during a cycling race in Antwerp. But in the end, Raf and Mich Walschaerts noticed that a show writes itself, and 'Spaak' turned out to be a show about, once again, love and sadness.","popularity":0.1706,"poster_path":"/zNz9CKqRT3IejRBJEPzpvcMsmij.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2005-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kommil
