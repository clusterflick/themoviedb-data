This film provides a penetrating insight into a hidden non-binary sexual orientation. Based on over 10 years of PhD and further research, it brings to life the personal journeys of three men based on their attraction to non-operative trans women. The film presents a compelling case that this sexual orientation has existed throughout history and across all cultures, but has 'flown under the radarâ€™ in modern society.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dPDu4zQJQpz4S87S9UkoUr98Ujk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ambisexuality: Seeing More Colour in the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Watson","original_name":"James Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616211814df2910093fbfb3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":887,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dPDu4zQJQpz4S87S9UkoUr98Ujk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":601}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
