The Pilcomayo river and the La Estrella river, in western Formosa, became a colossal trap after their arms were lost in a labyrinth of mud, weeds, camalotes and cattails. The mission of making this territory known for the first time soon became an incessant struggle to survive. \"El Corazón del Bañado\" reconstructs what happened on that trip from the perspectives of the five protagonists: two biologists, a guide from the Pilagá ethnic group, a Creole guide and a documentary maker, the director of this film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/o5cMZyvY6AE4pL24XBiwZWJTH1k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Five people are trapped in the Bañado La Estrella, in northern Argentina, when they try to cross it for the first time in canoes.","title":"El corazón del bañado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonzalo Saleme","original_name":"Gonzalo Saleme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gonzalo Saleme","credit_id":"61623550ba131b00627be926","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baloy Salazar","original_name":"Baloy Salazar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Baloy Salazar","credit_id":"6162355f8e2ba60061a435cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chilo Ruiz","original_name":"Chilo Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chilo Ruiz","credit_id":"6162356bfe5c91002ad2cdab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Roggiero","original_name":"Martha Roggiero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Martha Roggiero","credit_id":"6162357618b75100298e9ce8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Brown,","original_name":"Alejandro Brown,","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alejandro Brown,","credit_id":"6162358089d97f0062220a71","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3264969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonzalo Saleme","original_name":"Gonzalo Saleme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616234744df291004388f3bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.739,"height":921,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5cMZyvY6AE4pL24XBiwZWJTH1k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":681}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
