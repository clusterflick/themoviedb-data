We meet Jack in the prologue as he interrupts a telecast of a movie review program. He claims REEFER MADNESS, the classic cult film which the two critics are reviewing, is nothing but a slanderous lie. We have been shown clips of the original film where Perry was portrayed as a low-life drug pusher. Now, here it is, decades after REEFER MADNESS was first released, and the real life Jack Perry shows up and claims, \"...the movie was made to frame me. I was actually an undercover cop!\" The two critics don't buy any of his story. Jack says he can prove what he claims by showing his version of the movie -- which he just happens to have brought along. The reviewers tell Jack that they don't have time to show his film on their program. Jack's 44 Magnum convinces them otherwise.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/mrm7YQcaeKGnjPVwcxDbbfiJqiT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reefer Madness II: The True Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Buchholz","original_name":"Bob Buchholz","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":"/j16Cs2F9DLABhkV3mMEd3Dzf9qC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecb9388e635710020d284ec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2653059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kent Skov","original_name":"Kent Skov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecb939e6c849200212fffd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244757","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6meXTXjH6KNRZibK7PpyRUZCBF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1969,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xgczYZOtyeknI8YhdSu4uj6qmnw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mrm7YQcaeKGnjPVwcxDbbfiJqiT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Reefer Madness 2...
