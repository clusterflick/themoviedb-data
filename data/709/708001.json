Head coach Gene Chizik was fired and replaced by Gus Malzahn, the offensive coordinator of that national title team. Expectations were bleak entering the 2013 season, as Malzahn inherited a team coming off its worst season in 60 years. What followed was one of the biggest single-season turnarounds in college football history â€” a year of implausible finishes, cinematic heroics, games for the ages...and, eventually, the symbolic return of those mighty oaks.","popularity":0.5057,"poster_path":"/jfCcbdTmGVpeI2nc4RJSWwP4V0a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55062,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Row Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miracles on the Plains","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Quaid","original_name":"Dennis Quaid","popularity":3.0344,"profile_path":"/lMaDAJHzsKH7U3dln2B3kY3rOhE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"631bfbaefa4046007b460c51","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Karpf","original_name":"Rory Karpf","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca44fa8e2e000020240895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4911324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t7qrYLmGbRQ50U00KUArCm5BWHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zKLtCGq1tlO01SM5EYFVnqLh3qs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.267,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/54Y4qVXQUjA2UxRijblYfKse3Hi.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1647},{"aspect_ratio":1.265,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1M93uN1KcZFuKWQVqq4N84mTIup.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1644}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jfCcbdTmGVpeI2nc4RJSWwP4V0a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Star+","release_date":"2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ESPN","release_date":"2015-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
