The hotel owner offers this tourist a suite, coincidentally for the same amount as what he owes the baker. When the hotelier receives the amount in cash, he can finally settle his debt. Next, it turns out the baker also has an outstanding balance, etcetera. In this absurd comedy about the circular economy, it is clear that constantly making and settling debts brings unanticipated consequences.","popularity":0.1019,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":134457,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corrino Drama BV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Debt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laus Steenbeeke","original_name":"Laus Steenbeeke","popularity":0.2474,"profile_path":"/4T3sABimEkFeGdakiOFfFDYadJE.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecaef018e2e000020260667","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kok-Hwa Lie","original_name":"Kok-Hwa Lie","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecaef098e8d300020e1e622","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Dunnink","original_name":"Marion Dunnink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecaef11e635710021cf3026","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652453,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Iofe","original_name":"Igor Iofe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeef16c8492001f2c7fa5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cecile Neeteson","original_name":"Cecile Neeteson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeea3140bad001b1dc82c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963742,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Berends","original_name":"Daniel Berends","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeed46c8492001f2c7f8e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073644,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karlijn Hendriksen","original_name":"Karlijn Hendriksen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeee56c849200212f42e1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piet van Steen","original_name":"Piet van Steen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeebc6c8492001f2c7f82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Germen Boelens","original_name":"Germen Boelens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaee8ae635710022d4fa81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carelsz","original_name":"Patrick Carelsz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaee76bb070d0022e7267d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652452,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Suzy van der Wal","original_name":"Suzy van der Wal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeeaee635710021cf2fdd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652451,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sean Glavey","original_name":"Sean Glavey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaee95140bad001b1dc823","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133135,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Anna Dijkman","original_name":"Anna Dijkman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeec86c849200212f42c0","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carelsz","original_name":"Patrick Carelsz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaee7b8e8d300020e1e5ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963742,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Berends","original_name":"Daniel Berends","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecaeed98e8d30001fe1ed2d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
