A poetic and realist drama about duties, dreams and desires that draws you into the world of Kalyani. Kalyani is a young cook who lives with her ailing aunt and a young man in a rundown agraharam in Trivandrum. Each day is the same as she carries on with her life of duty as a cook and carer. But each day is not the same too. As the romance of poetry ignites a passion, as the stories of other worlds stirs a desire, as sharks close in and death draws near, Run Kalyani builds into an intense crescendo of grief and grit, sorrow and strength.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/n3ubWKkyIttneafIptdrDx3QRQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run Kalyani","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4136952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garggi Ananthan","original_name":"Garggi Ananthan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/pIASTJk03NH24Co7wUPsKsapBBz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kalyani","credit_id":"649d59033e6f2b01392d2423","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhu","original_name":"Madhu","popularity":0.1984,"profile_path":"/LZ5Q93nkROAQtb7XlebwVaD2Dx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"649d592c8289a000c581d933","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meera Nair","original_name":"Meera Nair","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nirmala","credit_id":"631039b60231f20091be619b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2597761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devaki Rajendran","original_name":"Devaki Rajendran","popularity":0.6113,"profile_path":"/boX9yVnDfmcizD1GEQJn4T0qhms.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"649d59bc5aba3201399406be","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geetha J","original_name":"Geetha J","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f3c863db72c00091a4e808","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492093,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"B.
