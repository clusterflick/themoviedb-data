Chiku, a transwoman and Wei, a lesbian, got “ legally” married in Taiwan on December, 2012. The documentary shows the subtle moments of their daily marriage life, through which the imagined voyeuristic spectacle is turned into everyday tactics. The main idea is to highlight the gender fluidity that cannot be fixed onto heterosexual framework and to, radically, ask for a reconsideration of the entire system of gender norms.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/7xU60C1sxDQWjCdIX2z86FFM9hc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SHe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2652935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kuo Hsin-Ying","original_name":"Kuo Hsin-Ying","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecb69d3d2147c0023c57d9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1494,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7xU60C1sxDQWjCdIX2z86FFM9hc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
