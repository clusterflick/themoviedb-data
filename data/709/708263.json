Its a short, formal documentary which intimately observes the sacred spaces of a fifteen year old girl named Lola. The larger series will examine many more of these spaces across a wide range of race, class, location and culture. The painful process of shedding adolescence is actualized in this highly curated interior--a sanctuary and visible elegy to childhood. Through languid drifts across the details of Lola's bedroom, a secret language is revealed.","popularity":0.1625,"poster_path":"/qMXnTcfi3Kuz0boXxqGd7BkSZkR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146119,"logo_path":null,"name":"FOREVERING FILMS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lola, 15","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2735227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Beale","original_name":"Lola Beale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2e52736840cc003780861f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1333168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Reeder","original_name":"Jennifer Reeder","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/1U5XGB3m7r81bcR6Ok1SmcCQWXA.jpg","credit_id":"5ecae2d7e635710020d1ab9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211685,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Olenick","original_name":"Mike Olenick","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2e52a8f48b340036aee3aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2735228,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jill Beale","original_name":"Jill Beale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2e5284be7f350035f305b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511742,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joshua Zucker-Pluda","original_name":"Joshua Zucker-Pluda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2e529e699fb70039f80e1b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018100,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Steven Hudosh","original_name":"Steven Hudosh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2e5292b77d4b003409111d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187024,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Zinner","original_name":"Nick Zinner","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe28d9de640d6003fa65bac","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9183812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jEEvBKoMGSPwwJP0QtNQEbleUmd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/63lMhVoAndhbtJfIa0Y8aqfnOek.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qMXnTcfi3Kuz0boXxqGd7BkSZkR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival du Nouveau Cinéma de Montréal","release_date":"2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
