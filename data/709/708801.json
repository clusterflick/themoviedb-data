Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole. And after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.","popularity":0.1697,"poster_path":"/neDVnkztMZQg6BDeaidBHe3xTpd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Past We Can Never Return To","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Green","original_name":"John Green","popularity":0.4203,"profile_path":"/k5AOKSIe72G16yhrAhMOI5u5DB7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ecc615719690c001d6fa09d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.76,"height":1716,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/neDVnkztMZQg6BDeaidBHe3xTpd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1304}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
