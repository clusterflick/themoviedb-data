For Patricio this does not seem to be a problem; it is shown as a person willing to a fickle love. But Marco plays the role of the neurotic: he does not feel a taste in this triad, he chases the girl, questions his friend, bothers the relationship and shows his disagreement. This could go through a triangle to use, one more in the history of cinema. But sometimes the geometry breaks.","popularity":0.0947,"poster_path":"/iBIBW20ZjGVy7FtzZTjwmwkhRLE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El amor cambia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julián Larquier Tellarini","original_name":"Julián Larquier Tellarini","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/1fWqLU4U0BHendob3SGMV4xYs33.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecc05fd8e2e000020291287","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignacio Rogers","original_name":"Ignacio Rogers","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/gm1gc8VAfA7z5uC2ap5Q5qqrDf2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecc0606bb070d0022e89165","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1279656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofía Romano","original_name":"Sofía Romano","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecc06136f6a99001f2975e3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Ceroi","original_name":"Ignacio Ceroi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecc05b15b124000201115b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Ceroi","original_name":"Ignacio Ceroi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecc05babb070d0020e809e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Ceroi","original_name":"Ignacio Ceroi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecc05c25b1240001f115652","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Ceroi","original_name":"Ignacio Ceroi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecc05cbe635710022d712e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918498,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sofía Victoria Rodrigo","original_name":"Sofía Victoria Rodrigo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecc05f06c8492002034f92d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBIBW20ZjGVy7FtzZTjwmwkhRLE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
