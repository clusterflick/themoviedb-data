Their big dream: performing at the music festival in San Remo. An Italian tour could bring them to the next level. The days go by acrimoniously in rundown roadhouses; at night the duo plays dives along the Italian rustbelt. Not quite their image of bella Italia. Suddenly, this gamble seems completely insane. A 9 to 5 life would be so much easier. The crisis culminates when an unwelcome hitchhiker stumbles into their universe. As the dream threatens to shatter, the adventure begins.","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":"/xBLwKci7RPxNMBiTkDdcASwF1KL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Farfan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Remo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea Willkowsky","original_name":"Lea Willkowsky","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/u7dNAZYCZFK3MalFs1CYwWWvwD1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5eca585b140bad001c1a570f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albertine Sarges","original_name":"Albertine Sarges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eca586b8e2e00607410a79e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Eppner","original_name":"Sebastian Eppner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eca5875e635710022d3d878","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506267,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johanna Behre","original_name":"Johanna Behre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca58946c8492001f2c09af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859036,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andi Pek","original_name":"Andi Pek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca5981e635710020d0edc3","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1822660,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laura Engelhardt","original_name":"Laura Engelhardt","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca58b4e635710021ceb119","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hannah Schopf","original_name":"Hannah Schopf","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca595ae635710020d0edb2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tobias Feltes","original_name":"Tobias Feltes","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca591b8e2e000020244849","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173198,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julia Geiß","original_name":"Julia Geiß","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca58f8e635710022d3da4e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859036,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andi Pek","original_name":"Andi Pek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca590c8e2e000020244828","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506267,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johanna Behre","original_name":"Johanna Behre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca598e140bad001b1c9441","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506267,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johanna Behre","original_name":"Johanna Behre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca58a1d2147c0023c3a9d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"FUNREMO","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xBLwKci7RPxNMBiTkDdcASwF1KL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":684}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"San Remo Official Trailer 2019","key":"361087205","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-09-19T16:00:00.000Z","id":"5eca5baae635710021ceb3e4"}]}}}
