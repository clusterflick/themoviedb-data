Until his death in 2008, Mandelbaum was one of very few Sonderkommando to have survived the death camps, execution as collaborators by the Soviets and later reprisals by other Jews. The stories he tells and the photographs used are stomach-churning.","popularity":0.0834,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sonderkommando: The Living Dead of Auschwitz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Auschwitz Ofrivilliga Bödlar","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2595593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanislav Motl","original_name":"Stanislav Motl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca8567e635710020d12b2b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Plumley","original_name":"Chris Plumley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca85776c849200212eba11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767883,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Fletcher","original_name":"Chris Fletcher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca858db3e627002230b6bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502815,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viktor Malina","original_name":"Viktor Malina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca85a28e2e00002024dd3e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomáš Svoboda","original_name":"Tomáš Svoboda","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca85b3e635710020d12bb3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pavel Dražan","original_name":"Pavel Dražan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca85c7d2147c0021b8e000","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
