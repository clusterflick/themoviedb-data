They are the backbone of the biosphere, fertilizing the earth, regulating the climate and water cycles, indispensable to our survival on earth. But just as science is starting to understand the true importance of this little-known genius, its very existence is menaced by man-made disruption. This film provides a science-based exploration into the superpowers of trees, a first-of-its-kind journey below the surface, to better understand them, and also the challenge that we face together in the struggle against global warming – a journey into a new dimension.","popularity":0.1281,"poster_path":"/6LDmeYITDdj2mAmE89OFZUGUWUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24033,"logo_path":"/dZ7shHqHbMAD05hQPzYgz5OAKwl.png","name":"France 5","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trees, a Global Superpower","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le génie des arbres","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Trees, a Global Superpower","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Trees, a Global Superpower","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1958837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuelle Nobécourt","original_name":"Emmanuelle Nobécourt","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecab84b140bad001b1d64c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12323578","wikidata_id":"Q112972259","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/blONdP1oEAxkPIooG8tmESd7k14.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6LDmeYITDdj2mAmE89OFZUGUWUT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":810},{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":950,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rmMdeB1egMxnU5diWqiIHYZQ0sA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kHGs6G8tIT5FgpYFYU4X5MaxadH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
