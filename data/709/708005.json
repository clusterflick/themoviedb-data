For most, the revelation was a surprise. For his teammates in Columbia, Missouri, it was not news. In the Tigers football family, Michael had found acceptance. The extraordinary bond Sam forged with wide receiver L'Damian Washington and defensive tackle Marvin Foster was bigger than football - they became brothers.
