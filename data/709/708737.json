Metacine or metagay? Gay cinema within cinema or cinema within gay cinema, variations of a daedalus of representations. \"The current boyfriend\" feeds on lateral humor, on the political of desire as a talk in the kitchen, on the flicker-free observation of who we are and what we pretend to be, as a nucleus that is reinterpreted with always different gestures, once as drama and another like comedy, almost without knowing which is appropriate.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":"/u5OONhWvo2DzrCYkvpIsk287SYI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11999,"logo_path":"/50K9W66YeWjOalNcjWddPcSgIYO.png","name":"Universidad del
