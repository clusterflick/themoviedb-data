This program investigates a chequered past and puts the speculation into perspective, taking into account the tragic culling and ‘bounty era’ where the carnivorous creatures were thought to be solely responsible for a considerable loss of farmers’ livestock.  Balancing the facts with personal reflections from Tasmanian locals, scientists and other informed practitioners, The Tasmanian Tiger is a thought-provoking and revealing look at the extraordinary life and death of one of Australia’s most mysterious marsupials.","popularity":0.6769,"poster_path":"/oF3YjYVampjid7kgF71tvpYUj3a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winning Post
