The filmmakers attempt to illustrate how molecular machines interact with each other according to the central dogma, with an anime look. This approach helps people (especially kids) to identify these molecules more easily, and to understand how they function in the body. There are two versions of the film: one with English narration and text, and another in Japanese.","popularity":0.3038,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73853,"logo_path":null,"name":"RIKEN Omics Science Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Central Dogma: From Genomic Information to Protein Synthesis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585894,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Toshihide Kasahara","original_name":"Toshihide Kasahara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86b8c9251412fe8003778","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585895,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kazufumi Watanabe","original_name":"Kazufumi Watanabe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86b9792514162b7007ee8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585895,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kazufumi Watanabe","original_name":"Kazufumi Watanabe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86ba29251412fe8003781","department":"Writing","job":"Storyboard"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585895,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kazufumi Watanabe","original_name":"Kazufumi Watanabe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86baf9251412fe8003784","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoshihide Hayashizaki","original_name":"Yoshihide Hayashizaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86b629251412fe8003769","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585896,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hyakume Tsukino","original_name":"Hyakume Tsukino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86bb7c3a3681e4a01ed07","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sorahiko Nukatani","original_name":"Sorahiko Nukatani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d86b6d9251412fe800376f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6017,"name":"genetics"},{"id":6016,"name":"biology"},{"id":1718,"name":"dna"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Central Dogma (English version)","key":"-ygpqVr7_xs","published_at":"2008-06-23T06:46:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"56d86c6c9251416ff2003f00"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"セントラルドグマ ～ゲノム情報からタンパク質ができるまで～ / The Central Dogma","key":"EgweXtBCynE","published_at":"2008-01-23T06:13:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"56d86c92c3a3682cef00eaa6"}]}}}
