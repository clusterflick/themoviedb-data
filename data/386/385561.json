Highly symbolic character of the Camargue, aristocrat and dandy, he was also a manager and hotelier. He would lead the immemorial life of an animal herder if he did not have another passion: images. The photographic apparatus and the camera are like sensitive antennas that he spreads over his world and which seek the truth beyond appearances. Since Crin Blanc his photographs have appeared in illustrated books on five continents. Among his many films, Corrida Interdite (in competition at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival) and Le Rêve des Chevaux Sauvages (Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival) are global short film successes. The animals, the images... a single passion: that of a free life in one of the rare countries where you can still live freely: the Camargue.","popularity":0.384,"poster_path":"/1vTeHZOy6kWV8GCci24CqKKuhn0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corrida Interdite","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denys Colomb de Daunant","original_name":"Denys Colomb de Daunant","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/c4WZDdAMMLKLC4HQtV1kqkTMbHE.jpg","credit_id":"56d828a492514175a3001975","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1585775,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Lesur","original_name":"Daniel Lesur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d828aec3a3681e3c0201d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385857,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Guillemot","original_name":"Claude Guillemot","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d828b89251414291004f65","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0301131","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rBYYcUKlzFVyBSy5CLUPRtxQ6z6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vTeHZOy6kWV8GCci24CqKKuhn0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2391,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/As9A3Qan1mz4HE7UCt0M5ragEB5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":323419,"name":"south of france"},{"id":323422,"name":"corrida"},{"id":323423,"name":"spanish traditions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
