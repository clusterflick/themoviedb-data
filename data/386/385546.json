Beginning with the original image transmitted on television, the video compresses years into seconds, until nothing remains but a pile of rubble—a cynical commentary on the decay of American idealism from the ’60s to the present day. The sound is taken from recorded radio transmissions between mission control and the lunar base, but the dialogue has been removed; all that remains are the beeping radio carrier signals, static, and interference.","popularity":0.0767,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea of Tranquility","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Brambilla","original_name":"Marco Brambilla","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/uTmYDkzNUT4bYhGtcWYCEEtVFFY.jpg","credit_id":"56d8104dc3a3681e3c01fc61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
