He and his brother-in-law Leo Durridge were swept away when the section of riverbank they were fishing from collapsed. Leo fought his way to the shallows and is in hospital with cuts and bruises - Rafe wasn’t so lucky. But when detective Corinne Evans investigates, she finds the cause of Rafe’s death isn’t drowning at all - he’s been stabbed through the heart, and Leo is the prime suspect. While he claims that he and Rafe were the only ones by the river on that stormy day, but a witness says he heard three voices, and forensic examination of the scene reveals three sets of bootprints.","popularity":0.8996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder: The Third Voice","video":false,"vote_average":1.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morven Christie","original_name":"Morven Christie","popularity":0.6597,"profile_path":"/fTlG9uWyaiQt9UATyPYswjo9EGh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56d5b08692514111eb001fe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter McDonald","original_name":"Peter McDonald","popularity":0.6553,"profile_path":"/ahacAWWP4zzuVumOUB8hZoJcHTA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56d85f119251412fe80033a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gilhooley","original_name":"Frank Gilhooley","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/rFSlb5WhGRBk18aJbPdwlevEegG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56d5b0ac925141719e00187a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shauna Macdonald","original_name":"Shauna Macdonald","popularity":0.3936,"profile_path":"/37npPeVbx8ZZ0e54gs9JrrxAxoA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56d5b0b99251410bd1005411","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conor McCarron","original_name":"Conor McCarron","popularity":0.0734,"profile_path":"/tbGqjtIzY8kJ1MZM7eAl9HYHti7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56d8c5d1c3a36870ac00d9a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Roëves","original_name":"Maurice Roëves","popularity":0.4094,"profile_path":"/3WT7GhYloKzgiizP5pahruFbBOD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56d8c5ed925141429100803e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valene Kane","original_name":"Valene Kane","popularity":0.2277,"profile_path":"/qO978VX2GqT81tkapFoyPBs1r6U.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"56d8c5fcc3a3682cef00f55d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Preston","original_name":"Stewart Preston","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"56d8c608925141391f00c9b7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1585961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Allan","original_name":"Kim Allan","popularity":0.334,"profile_path":"/lvFLHDgJvepgOZCCmH7ZruNPogq.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"56d8c61892514175a3004864","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1585962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Leonard Morgan","original_name":"Naomi Leonard Morgan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"56d8c62bc3a3681e3601fe4c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Birger Larsen","original_name":"Birger Larsen","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/aDbC885b1eD3en8HVjMAtwMeGbA.jpg","credit_id":"56d5b07bc3a3682cef005c17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5559222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":9826,"name":"murder"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
