Twenty years pass, and Marsh emerges from jail and establishes himself as the head of a powerful crime empire, with his daughter, Paula, serving as bait to attract wealthy victims. Paula falls in love with Lee Travers, the adopted son of Marsh's old enemy, and begins to have doubts about her life of crime. Only after a series of tragic incidents is she set free to marry Lee and start life anew. This silent feature was highly regarded for its set design and 'unusual sensitivity to the expressive range of the camera and their awareness of careful scenario construction as a key to emotionally powerful cinema'.  Cast includes Marie Lorraine, Arthur Greenaway, John Faulkner.  A sound version was attempted soon after but was not successful and was never released.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/b1ddVjanyxaORiRAnmyfoRlGXZd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127893,"logo_path":null,"name":"McDonagh Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1929-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cheaters","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1590168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Lorraine","original_name":"Marie Lorraine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Paula Marsh","credit_id":"56e4da039251416d4000579a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Greenaway","original_name":"Arthur Greenaway","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Richard Marsh","credit_id":"5e213aea397df00014974202","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Faulkner","original_name":"John Faulkner","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"John Travers","credit_id":"5e213b2720af7700163885ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Bambach","original_name":"Josef Bambach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lee Travers","credit_id":"61c773d766a0d30096a9fb84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie McNiven","original_name":"Nellie McNiven","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Hugh Nash","credit_id":"61c773feaaec71006284e2b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2510451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine de Chair","original_name":"Elaine de Chair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Louise Nash","credit_id":"61c7740dc15f89001c01b4fe","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1471153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulette McDonagh","original_name":"Paulette McDonagh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d98cce925141340201ebb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870032,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack Fletcher","original_name":"Jack Fletcher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e213ac3bfeb8b0015cdcd45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1471153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulette McDonagh","original_name":"Paulette McDonagh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e213a69cf4b8b0012f02e12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512322,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Phyllis McDonagh","original_name":"Phyllis McDonagh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e213a99bfeb8b0013cd8013","department":"Art","job":"Art Department Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0020757","wikidata_id":"Q7722268","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1061,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b1ddVjanyxaORiRAnmyfoRlGXZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
