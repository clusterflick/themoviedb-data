The linkage of the individual segments was achieved by applying an old game used by Surrealist artists in the 1920's to explore the collective imagination. That game, called \"Exquisite Corpse\", was first applied in literary form by a group of poets each supplying one line of the total poem. In drawing, a group of artists would take turns drawing one part of a human figure, without seeing what the others had contributed.","popularity":0.2108,"poster_path":"/qcky31bI2VRPPVtgLBTRELe1FO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exquisite Corpse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Naday","original_name":"Dean Naday","popularity":0.0501,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b114c3a368210e024c63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1513633,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kenneth George Godwin","original_name":"Kenneth George Godwin","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b0649251410391027243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489530,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Michael Drabot","original_name":"Michael Drabot","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5affc0e0a2622bf02c89c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Naday","original_name":"Pierre Naday","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b14c9251410396029d70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Bewcyk","original_name":"Tim Bewcyk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5afe1c3a36820f002f0fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229987,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cliff Hokanson","original_name":"Cliff Hokanson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b0ac9251410396029cbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tricia Wasney","original_name":"Tricia Wasney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b1a80e0a2622cc02c223","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Pomeroy","original_name":"Jim Pomeroy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b193c3a368210e024d05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299193,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Kelly","original_name":"Paula Kelly","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b0cfc3a3682112027c9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole O'Brien","original_name":"Carole O'Brien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b169c3a36820f502a4a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Hebert","original_name":"Gilles Hebert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd5b086c3a3682112027c53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192003","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qcky31bI2VRPPVtgLBTRELe1FO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Toronto International Film Festival 1992","release_date":"1992-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
