In the guise of a warning against wartime juvenile delinquency, the film offers the exploitational tale of a bunch of wild, unsupervised kids at large in a small community. With nothing but time on their hands, the young protagonists become involved with petty theft, inevitably leading to some pretty serious consequences.","popularity":0.2593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Dramatic Thunderbolt Of Modern Youth!","title":"Teen Age","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Heyes","original_name":"Herbert Heyes","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/nFq5tQbLJXkq1BcudYnvAIZADXj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"District Attorney","credit_id":"56d48922925141391f00169f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wheeler Oakman","original_name":"Wheeler Oakman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/4F4BCjUnk4h8P2QLRaKhE46OJSC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jim Murray (archive footage)","credit_id":"56d48932925141391f0016a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Duncan","original_name":"Johnny Duncan","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/qiIHMG2rIzSshPFvVgLwXaRQ1nw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dan Murray","credit_id":"56d4893f925141391f0016a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Towns","original_name":"Fred Towns","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eddie Quinten","credit_id":"56d4894c925141340201158f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Stanton","original_name":"Sylvia Stanton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rose Gordon","credit_id":"56d48959c3a3681e44016ee3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard L'Estrange","original_name":"Richard L'Estrange","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/ubM9lTn9d14Zvhkl2o9PYluIOvU.jpg","credit_id":"56d488f4c3a3681e39014bf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elmer Clifton","original_name":"Elmer Clifton","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/mvXMvJTfeZkj3rqU0ANVW5xUN92.jpg","credit_id":"56d48901c3a3681e39014bf6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elmer Clifton","original_name":"Elmer Clifton","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/mvXMvJTfeZkj3rqU0ANVW5xUN92.jpg","credit_id":"56d4890692514157b5007f3b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2804,"name":"exploitation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1944-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
