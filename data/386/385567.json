Mayakovskiy is the star; his occasional presence holds together a film driven by the sound, the beat, of his poetry. Evteeva develops a dramatic structure of flaring, fading, being from light: violin strings become rays, quivering dull yellow spots, pictures. The plot assails the material from which it derives energy from material. History, growling and roaring, finds its form.","popularity":0.3214,"poster_path":"/4G2jSVQsmxE59KZzhbW2U0pZH3e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":75158,"logo_path":null,"name":"PIEF Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Horse, the Violin and a Little Bit Nervous","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1478764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Traugot","original_name":"Georgi Traugot","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/sp2d2T8nvHEOtic77QDYFksMhDs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64cb3d8ce263bb011eab2ca2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarita Bychkova","original_name":"Маргарита Бычкова","popularity":0.2531,"profile_path":"/q0shRjxDC9JXQF4lWobgq3vSdAV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64cb3d7b764b9900e3b998c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Semyon Furman","original_name":"Семён Фурман","popularity":0.2851,"profile_path":"/EW7qtRsY1elcaxuqywioj25U75.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64cb3d92297338020a8833b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Cherdyntsev","original_name":"Борис Чердынцев","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/pJWqaFVbgibyhvLHnUKgtFXGwnj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64cb3d98764b99011df50f12","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1836807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Reshetnikova","original_name":"Татьяна Решетникова","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/hwUIBK42aHE0qSCTBeDYUpRsIJB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64cb3d9e706e56012d64ba1f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoli Petrov","original_name":"Анатолий Петров","popularity":0.1656,"profile_path":"/bvE0sWV2YBHmF2HvxmVw1n90vZl.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"65b80f2fa39d0b01780bd5c7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Evteeva","original_name":"Ирина Евтеева","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/bPJTfHwrRR1LhmyChQ65DSg1jan.jpg","credit_id":"56d830bc9251416ff2001c04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806325,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Genrikh Marandzhyan","original_name":"Генрих Маранджян","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cb3dc04fd1410146b74410","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957523,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich","original_name":"Дмитрий Шостакович","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":"/oIut0fO6gtrf6jdEIqWMlbvgKsG.jpg","credit_id":"64cb3dd6764b99013af65bb9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Evteeva","original_name":"Ирина Евтеева","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/bPJTfHwrRR1LhmyChQ65DSg1jan.jpg","credit_id":"64cb3de14fd14100b0f2df31","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Evteeva","original_name":"Ирина Евтеева","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/bPJTfHwrRR1LhmyChQ65DSg1jan.jpg","credit_id":"64cb3daee04d8a011d76f426","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2422764,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Algirdas Paulavicius","original_name":"Algirdas Paulavičius","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/x4pCGwIMepuEZo8yYXsO5TnLt8w.jpg","credit_id":"64cb3dce4fd1410146b7441a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1602669,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tamara Denisova","original_name":"Tamara Denisova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cb3de9e263bb00e4042357","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3975508","wikidata_id":"Q20081481","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4G2jSVQsmxE59KZzhbW2U0pZH3e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
