It is divided into three parts: in the first, slaughter by automobile is shown; in the third, by military engagements; in the center section children pantomime syncopated movements from top to bottom. The secret, twilight imaginings of a wreckless character in the horrifying motion of falling or ejection in triplicate from an auto-trauma-mobile, the alternation—through the manipulation—of his original motion, offers us, as a source of comfort, the bicorporeal vision of him as he travels along the parabola of his fall from a residual sequence of a most personal and fatal leap.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traumatografo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Gioli","original_name":"Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/mA2Q0SwP0Wk56hRNNCQDeKNSFdE.jpg","credit_id":"56d718e9c3a36870ac00739b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3196754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
