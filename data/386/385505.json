The exhumed corpses of deceased street-level criminals are being discovered all over the city... Weeks after they've died! But who's digging up dead criminals? And why? Max Helms is a rough and tumble private-eye with his thumb on the pulse of San Francisco's low-rent criminals. Polly Bixby is Max's sassy-but-resourceful secretary. When a mugger unwittingly drops a stolen African relic right in Max and Polly's laps, they discover an underworld of occultists lead by German mobster Gustov Heinrich. Max and Polly uncover Heinrich's devious plot to take over San Francisco using an undead criminal army, but can they stop his evil plans in time?","popularity":0.0864,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max Helms: Curse of the Relic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Evancic","original_name":"Matthew Evancic","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Don Montana (voice)","credit_id":"56d77456c3a3681e3601ad29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Evancic","original_name":"Matthew Evancic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Don Montana (voice)","credit_id":"56d7745ac3a3681e3c01db36","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Evancic","original_name":"Matthew Evancic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Don Montana (voice)","credit_id":"56d7746292514112cd003ea7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585631,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Firenze","original_name":"Sam Firenze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d7735c9251411884006b34","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585632,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maynard Gardiner","original_name":"Maynard Gardiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d77373c3a3681e3c01db17","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Ilacqua","original_name":"Anthony Ilacqua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d773899251414291002afd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joshua F.
