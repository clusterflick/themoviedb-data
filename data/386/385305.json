Through interviews with a number of key art personalities from the 70s and 80s, as well as many modern, alternative poster artists, “Twenty-Four by Thirty-Six” aims to answer the question: What happened to the illustrated movie poster? Where did it disappear to, and why? In the mid 2000s, filling the void left behind by Hollywood’s abandonment of illustrated movie posters, independent artists and galleries began selling limited edition, screenprinted posters — a movement that has quickly exploded into a booming industry with prints selling out online in seconds, inspiring Hollywood studios to take notice of illustration in movie posters once more.","popularity":1.0206,"poster_path":"/3pGFlpDBsLv0p6KPQLl53HVTbJp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A movie about movie posters.","title":"24×36","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":31,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"24X36: A Movie About Movie Posters","type":"Documentary/History"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Twenty-Four by Thirty-Six","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3425286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Ainsworth","original_name":"Paul Ainsworth","popularity":0.0562,"profile_path":"/fcBpZYX4iTNa1eZhmV2r4M6NKOx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62094068af2da800694aee37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2281880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Alexander","original_name":"Dave Alexander","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"620940dd1cac8c00b77d97b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharm Murugiah","original_name":"Sharm Murugiah","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself -
