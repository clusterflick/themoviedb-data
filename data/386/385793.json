Using the menacing imagery of the howling wind, the artist provokes viewers to reflect on the insanity of war. While the film is symbolic, its message is unmistakably clear: unless there is an end to conflict, we will continue to see our children swept away like leaves in the wind.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/JIkh372CdhkRx6ZAxfVZeUwP3u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of War","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Souvenirs de guerre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Normand Roger","original_name":"Normand Roger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d99e94c3a3681e3902215c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"5a1e13a70e0a264cca070fa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226132","wikidata_id":"Q43503376","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/JIkh372CdhkRx6ZAxfVZeUwP3u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
