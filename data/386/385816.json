This is a film about the prison in which we never see an actual penitentiary. The film unfolds a cinematic journey through a series of landscapes across the USA where prisons do work and affect lives, from an anti-sex-offender pocket park in Los Angeles, to a congregation of ex-incarcerated chess players shut out of the formal labor market, to an Appalachian coal town betting its future on the promise of prison jobs.","popularity":0.3093,"poster_path":"/jdhr7T9X0EhLSaiOKOEOddgO3co.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oh Ratface Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prison in Twelve Landscapes","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Prison in Seven Landscapes","type":"TV Version"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Prison in 12 Landscapes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charisse Davidson","original_name":"Charisse Davidson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6126c14263a69500600c7a49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyndon B.
