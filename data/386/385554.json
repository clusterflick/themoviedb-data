Overlaying all three is a violently percussive audio montage. The result is a new visual choreography that rapidly builds to a state of sensory overload, emphasizing how viewers develop a resistance to graphic sex and brutality, both in the movies and in the news media in general. Only Syn Watch is included here, but you can find an excerpt of Sync Sex in the Destricted collection.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sync: Watch","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Brambilla","original_name":"Marco Brambilla","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/uTmYDkzNUT4bYhGtcWYCEEtVFFY.jpg","credit_id":"56d81a179251414291004d2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
