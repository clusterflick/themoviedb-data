Volatile union meetings and tension-filled interactions on the picket line provide an inside view of the tensions and conflicts inherent to labor negotiations.  Due to a lack of funds and a fire at Kartemquin which necessitated a re-edit of the film, the film was not released until 1980. Filming then began a year later on Taylor Chain II: A Story of Collective Bargaining.","popularity":0.263,"poster_path":"/rJerO3ghiPNWR5pPxa5AwnraQTb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taylor Chain I: A Story in a Union Local","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Quinn","original_name":"Gordon Quinn","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d3b58cc3a3681e3c012939","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Blumenthal","original_name":"Jerry Blumenthal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d3b5a99251413e5f011245","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090139","wikidata_id":"Q7689904","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jcX4yufcHX3iEbs6Kg5ECcYgngL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2208}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1003,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJerO3ghiPNWR5pPxa5AwnraQTb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Taylor Chain I: A Story in a Union Local (1980) | All Those in Favor of a Strike","key":"rXL8CJw6sI4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2009-07-27T22:11:32.000Z","id":"65dc13bc4539d00163be95f5"}]}}}
