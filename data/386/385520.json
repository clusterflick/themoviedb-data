The Cantrills are well known for their 'colour separation' films. To create these works they shoot a scene three separate times on black and white film stock, using a different colour filter each time. In the lab, they combine these three films onto a single Eastmancolour print. This process creates dramatic transitions in colour that the Cantrills liken to the vibrancy of Technicolor.  Though the footage here was shot in the mid-’80s, it was only last year that they edited it into this fifteen-minute movie. Structurally it’s simple enough: just a series of views of various parts of inner Melbourne, from panoramic wide shots to close-ups of the sides of buildings. The soundtrack blends and warps familiar urban noises – cars, buskers, the ringing bells of trams – into a kind of musique concréte.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4g3cMCCbsIreO1d79vmdVlKnpQa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City of Chromatic Dissolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Cantrill","original_name":"Arthur Cantrill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d7af62925141719e00642e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinne Cantrill","original_name":"Corinne Cantrill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d7af6dc3a3681e3601b7f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xfYD7xfQXIA2JrAZZDWmSnN3113.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4g3cMCCbsIreO1d79vmdVlKnpQa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zR4AP6yGnSjsdVSrDj9ZgLLQVcW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
