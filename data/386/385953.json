Blending archival and original footage, he brings to life a cast of historical characters spanning over 12,000 years, from Florida's ancient Indians to the migrant farm workers of the 21st century. Meet Osceola and the Seminoles, who fought alongside escaped slaves in the most costly Indian War in American History. Unmask Florida's Ku Klux Klan and don't forget about Walt Disney and Henry Flagler - perhaps the two characters most responsible for the Florida we know today.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/49aMIGXdt63CsuW3lDKtEV7Zr1R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"All histories are invisible histories, some are just more invisible than others.","title":"Cracker Crazy: Invisible Histories of the Sunshine State","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Koszulinski","original_name":"Georg Koszulinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f2b884c3a3681acd000192","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0972551","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49aMIGXdt63CsuW3lDKtEV7Zr1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
