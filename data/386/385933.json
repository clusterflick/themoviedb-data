Referred to as “The Citizen Kane of bad movies” by Entertainment Weekly, The Room grossed only $1800 during it’s initial box office run. Against all odds, Mr. Wiseau’s disastrous film found a new life on the midnight movie circuit and now plays to audiences around the world making it one of the most adored and important films in popular culture.  Follow Rick Harper and his team on their journey across the Globe as they experience this midnight movie phenomenon, meet with the entire cast and crew of the The Room and piece together the story behind the mysterious Tommy Wiseau.  The film has not yet received a full release due to legal action taken by Wiseau against the filmmakers.","popularity":0.209,"poster_path":"/sbe8jcn0ZbwaPrpABfQzkgEQ5ZU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockhaven
