He lectures her on the evils of crime and, to test her decency, leaves her alone with a large roll of bills. Jenny decides to go straight and leaves the money alone. She then gets a job as a dressmaker and is later called to the Van Dyke home to do some work for Bob's sister, and Jenny discovers that, faced with financial ruin in the stock market, Bob is about to steal $20,000 from his housekeeper. To forestall him, Jenny arranges for her old confederates to steal the money first, taking the blame for the crime herself. Inspired by Jenny's example, Bob accepts his bankruptcy with grace, becomes a golf pro, and marries Jenny, who, in the meantime, has returned the money and settled her score with the law.
