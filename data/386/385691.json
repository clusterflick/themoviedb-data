It was his message to the world. A group of teenagers are sent an unlabeled DVD from a U.S. Army base in Afghanistan containing a video of a strange woman tied to a tree. It ends with a clue. The teens follow the clue to another and yet another, until what started out as a game becomes a terrifying chase into the psychopathic mind of Harris. At the end of the line, the teens' world comes full circle as they discover they weren't just playing a game, they were pawns in a revenge plot only a master of war could devise.","popularity":0.2263,"poster_path":"/rGbYACEPndk6gogOUMKecrlviIV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Descent","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Link","original_name":"Eva Link","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/qwU5332JEAtD3jYUWYGkfTEGBgY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"56d8d81992514175a3004c1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeline Link","original_name":"Madeline Link","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Morgan","credit_id":"56d8d82a92514162b7008c89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Surprenant","original_name":"Olivier Surprenant","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"John","credit_id":"56d8d83ec3a3681e360201ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3486954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caeden Lawrence","original_name":"Caeden Lawrence","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rhys","credit_id":"56d8d8869251414291008396","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Cairns","original_name":"Rachel Cairns","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"56d8d892925141429100839a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Paul Coderre","original_name":"Timothy Paul Coderre","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Colonel Dooley","credit_id":"56d8d8adc3a3681e360201d4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Dines-Craig","original_name":"Katherine Dines-Craig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6s6qWfwpfMbXYEQRXoahxK603Li.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"56d8d8c1925141340201ced8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":943440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen MacDonald","original_name":"Stephen MacDonald","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Skater Boy","credit_id":"56d8d8e4c3a3681e4402338a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Lalande","original_name":"Valérie Lalande","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/gthvjHU9bMRVpIinP3qkrN0wYWs.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"56d8d8f09251412e28003148","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010153,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brooks Hunter","original_name":"Brooks Hunter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d8d7d5c3a3682cef00f86d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010153,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brooks Hunter","original_name":"Brooks Hunter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d8d7e8925141340201ce98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Menzies","original_name":"Robert Menzies","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/hmKWmfuZLb2y4evxrI4uZbSeiZ7.jpg","credit_id":"56d8d7ffc3a3681e3c023772","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maggie Newton","original_name":"Maggie Newton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d8d80bc3a3681e3602019a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4060988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b3raekmcYXcKGY1bRJCOLqD9Z9j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rGbYACEPndk6gogOUMKecrlviIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
