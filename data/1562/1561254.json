She delivers a monologue that places us in a world where people have stopped aging thanks to genetic manipulation. At 127 years old, Luce—cured of cancer—presents herself as the only elderly person left on Earth. The text blends excerpts from interviews with Luce Guilbeault, current biochemical research, and elements of dystopian fiction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ytJ43csGs29wbnzY5IjU12Khrhn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luce RTX3090","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Moreau","original_name":"Sylvie Moreau","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/dE9cU3jFhEs3Tc1YDpoQrgeUwU0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Luce Guilbeault","credit_id":"68eb9e4efe5c10c65f8aa9e1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Tremble","original_name":"Julie Tremble","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/2pj6eMAGEgR3e0kxmiDMojoXkmB.jpg","credit_id":"68eb9e79f484a8933d4b1c11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Tremble","original_name":"Julie Tremble","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/2pj6eMAGEgR3e0kxmiDMojoXkmB.jpg","credit_id":"68eb9e80e7862721959fdaf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Tremble","original_name":"Julie Tremble","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/2pj6eMAGEgR3e0kxmiDMojoXkmB.jpg","credit_id":"68eb9e876b0d5b42cd4b1c18","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2069809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Tremble","original_name":"Julie Tremble","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/2pj6eMAGEgR3e0kxmiDMojoXkmB.jpg","credit_id":"68eb9e9d1346947138321d0f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5744800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Émilie Blaise","original_name":"Émilie Blaise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb9f01ee2ce78b738aac4c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Pucella","original_name":"Bruno Pucella","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb9f4a747f368c05c3e12f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359975,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillaume Millet","original_name":"Guillaume Millet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb9f56d21130d37fc3e1be","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytJ43csGs29wbnzY5IjU12Khrhn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
