With great care, they sculpt characters, build sets, and bring everything to life with stop-motion. The end result is a universe full of angels and monsters, a creative translation of the way they experience the world around them. Filmmaker Patrick Van Antwerp gives a fascinating insight into the children’s creative process and the workings of the studio.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hW4XvCdIzXKmpGeXWH2BdPiExOy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139172,"logo_path":"/xCpC0XD53yvgLeTsSMCK781TERx.png","name":"Atelier Graphoui","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mômimages, le monde des Spoks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1935625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Van Antwerpen","original_name":"Patrick Van Antwerpen","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec035b2b3c9811110d78b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":1608,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hW4XvCdIzXKmpGeXWH2BdPiExOy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1054}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
