The only problem? He's introverted. They haven't booked a single show yet. And his girlfriend wants them to leave the only town he's ever known. A town where he struggles with the complicated, co-dependent relationship with his parents, who both live with cerebral palsy. Mildlife is a coming-of-age film that follows Lawrence, as he navigates every (not so?) simple decision... one scream at a
