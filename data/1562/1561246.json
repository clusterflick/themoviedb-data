When the young pair return to celebrate Armando’s law degree, a debt collector exposes that his qualification is forged and demands repayment. To protect his son’s honour, Papa Martin sacrifices his own comfort, returning to work and sending Armando away to start anew. As time passes, the family’s love, guilt, and redemption intertwine in a heartfelt story of sacrifice and moral reckoning.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caesar Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1924-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La gerla di Papà Martin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianna Terribili-Gonzales","original_name":"Gianna Terribili-Gonzales","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zqQJo8laWyjap5UoZVLY1vAmgBu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Olimpia","credit_id":"68eb9bab2a47e9f068786ead","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Amodio","original_name":"Francesco Amodio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Papá Martin","credit_id":"68eb9bcf0d98a4c38d9fdc43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5744785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augusta Raspantini","original_name":"Augusta Raspantini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Genovieffa","credit_id":"68eb9bf4ad8db28a55645dbf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Amato","original_name":"Giuseppe Amato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Armando Martins","credit_id":"68eb9c112a47e9f068786eb0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Biliotti","original_name":"Enzo Biliotti","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/hdJxY11m8GH5HD5JQV0yi8498tB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Feliciano","credit_id":"68eb9c2b7b5707fccec3e1d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gino Viotti","original_name":"Gino Viotti","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/ghGzdpDZLMIEpBoqLB5ywOEYIO4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Charançon","credit_id":"68eb9c54f7258adc564b1ac2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5744788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orietta Oriani","original_name":"Orietta Oriani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"68eb9d556b0d5b42cd4b1c0f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orietta Claudi","original_name":"Orietta Claudi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Amelia","credit_id":"68eb9d78d030ddd22d8aaa7e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3603637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rinaldo Rinaldi","original_name":"Rinaldo Rinaldi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Capitano Dubourg","credit_id":"68eb9d9740c86a65454b1a88","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Bonnard","original_name":"Mario Bonnard","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/jpo711tYTGphOppmSLivVECYKKv.jpg","credit_id":"68eb9aad40c86a65454b1a60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550888,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugène Cormon","original_name":"Eugène Cormon","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb9aecaf2e9559021a27db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2626583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugène Grangé","original_name":"Eugène Grangé","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb9b0cb573faa2ba8aab21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2582919,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giuseppe Paolo Vitrotti","original_name":"Giuseppe Paolo Vitrotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb9b2d5d99212991c3e0ae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1070774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
