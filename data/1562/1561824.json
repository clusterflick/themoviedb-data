Filmed during the 2022 anti-TERF protest in New York, its flickering, grainy images capture bodies and voices pushing against an invisible force. Over these visuals, a reading of Andrea Dworkin’s The Great Punctuation Typography Struggle reflects on language as both weapon and cage—who wields it, who submits to it, who is silenced by it. Chants of “TERFs go home!” and “Trans women are women!” pulse through the soundscape, urgent yet bound by the weight of systemic resistance. The film becomes more than a document of protest—it’s an inquiry into how struggles for liberation can, at times, mirror the structures they resist, lingering in the tension between defiance and entrapment, permanence and change.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Immovable Structure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5746628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliana Julieta","original_name":"Juliana Julieta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ecf59ebdfe689774a216d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
