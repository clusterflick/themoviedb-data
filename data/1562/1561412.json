But when six college students are found viciously murdered in the tiny town of Taylor, Miss., the clues left behind point to the mysterious Cajun werewolf lore known as the \"Loup Garou\". Together with his savvy graduate assistant Shad and a sassy undergraduate student, Dax joins forces with Government Operative Richard English to face off with whoever, or whatever, lurks in the dark woods of Taylor. But before the investigation can begin, Dax realizes he is being teamed with anthrozooological arch-rival, Dr. Doug-Clark Paulson, Russian big-game hunter Ernie Sokolov, and Dax's estranged wife, Claudia. The \"team\" is a powder-keg of emotions and criss-crossed interests as they set out to solve the mystery before the body count rises.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's natural habitat has been destroyed, now it is on the prowl, There's no escape from the Night of the Loup Garou","title":"Night of the Loup Garou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609172,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micah Ginn","original_name":"Micah Ginn","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ebeae8767ca7fc71282040","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5745230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Nothelfer","original_name":"Matthew Nothelfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ebeaf2caf7b786d6282064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609172,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micah Ginn","original_name":"Micah Ginn","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ebeb0272ac849b100d77e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5745230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Nothelfer","original_name":"Matthew Nothelfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ebeb0ce5bcd5f8dbd68bf8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1602563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
