The heist quickly unravels when Terry trips an alarm and a desperate chase erupts, motorcycles, sirens and a fatal confrontation in which Terry is forced to kill a guard. They make it back to their shed hideout expecting relief, but the relief never comes. A friend they thought had stayed out of the job returns, now aligned with the security forces, and the backyard sanctuary turns into a killing ground: Terry is shot dead and Steven runs for his life with nothing left but a pistol and a burning need for answers. Framed is a tense, character-driven thriller about loyalty, betrayal and how one misstep can flip a small plan into a ruinous vendetta.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/j9q4X7AahCmjumxyMwcVB4QKja8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":277043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Five Guys Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"One easy job.
