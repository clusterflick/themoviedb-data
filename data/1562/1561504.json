Learn correct form and breathing technique as you move through basic yoga poses and sequences that will help you increase strength, flexibility and overall fitness. Use each program separately, or, as you become more familiar and confident with poses, connect all three into a challenging 60-minute workout.  Energize: This practice builds on skills gained in the first program and introduces sun salutations and other sequences. As the flow increased, so will the calorie burn! The goal of this program is to energize, detoxify and increase flexibility.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wJYg5ofaoQrPawZ5ct132qTh1a5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beginning Yoga with Chrissy Carter - 2 Energize","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wJYg5ofaoQrPawZ5ct132qTh1a5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
