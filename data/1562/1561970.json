The next year, she was shocked to hear that her homeland would be leveled within two days - her \"old world\" was thus completely destroyed. After that, she spent a long time alone, often accompanied by her sick second daughter, and more often by an old TV and a deck of cards. When the wind blows, she dreams of the sunset, sheep, green grass, and curling smoke in her hometown. Every year, I go back with a camera to record her homesickness that has nowhere to go, listen to her reminiscences, and also take pictures of my childhood hometown that has also disappeared.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Grandmother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kuan Guo","original_name":"Kuan Guo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ed403defc0a23790d6926c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Caochangdi Mother Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
