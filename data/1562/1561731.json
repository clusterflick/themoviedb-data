What begins as love soon turns into conflict, as their differences and habits start to clash. Eventually, they break up — but since the quarantine isn’t over, they still have to live together.

Liu writes a heartfelt note to Tae, and in the end, it brings them back together once again.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do you think about this couple’s story?, “Do they love each other or hate each other?”","title":"14 DAYS I HATE YOU","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
