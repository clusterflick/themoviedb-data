Since 1961, the Berlin Wall had separated East and West—a symbol of fear, guarded by soldiers, barbed wire, and orders to shoot. But in 1989, the people rose up. In Leipzig, Berlin, and many other cities, they demanded freedom of travel, democracy, and a life without oppression. On the evening of November 9th, 1989, spokesman Günter Schabowski announced new travel regulations. Holding a small piece of paper, uncertain, he was asked when the new rules would take effect. Searching his notes, he finally said the words that would change history: “As of now. Immediately.” The news spread fast. That same night, thousands rushed to the border crossings. At Bornholmer Street, officer Harald Jäger faced a choice: use force or open the gates. He opened them. People cheered, hugged, and climbed the Wall. The Berlin Wall fell — not through violence, but through courage, hope, and the will of the people.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Mauerfall von Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
