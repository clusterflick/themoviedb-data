When she's denied the chance to train as a warrior because she's a woman, Villia takes fate into her own hands-cutting her hair, forging armor, and entering the brutal world of gladiators under a false identity and truth. But in the blood-soaked sands of the arena, secrets are hard to keep-and when enemies of the empire begin to uncover who she really is, Villia must fight not just for her survival, but for her legacy. What begins as a bold mission to prove herself becomes a war for the soul of Rome.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":200000,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One woman can change rome forever.","title":"Empress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5482252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"McKenzie Reed","original_name":"McKenzie Reed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Villia","credit_id":"68ec2f928c3c90444f9de90a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
