It primarily explores the anxiety of performance and the fear of being judged. Through various lives, the film communicates these pressures. A man who loses his temper over a letter, a comedian dying on stage and a dishonest friend. Anything from everyday actions to major stunts spiral out of control into moments of scrutiny and even silence becomes a form of judgement. By combining satire with a sense of self awareness, Shutter captures the true essence of creating, performing and exposing oneself to the gaze of others.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/16rdEOFIb5UuNaxVN46XwB2Xa3j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"They are always watching","title":"Shutter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5519051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Cammarano","original_name":"Max Cammarano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Everyone","credit_id":"68eb979daf0bf100181f685e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5519051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Cammarano","original_name":"Max Cammarano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb97b042902b78f4786bbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5519051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Cammarano","original_name":"Max Cammarano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb97b9a41cf5c9a0786d31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5519051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Cammarano","original_name":"Max Cammarano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68eb98b9da8e618bb1321d23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16rdEOFIb5UuNaxVN46XwB2Xa3j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shutter | Experimental Short Film","key":"HPgB03K-5qs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-09-08T06:23:07.000Z","id":"68eb972897e7dafe3b1f673c"}]}}}
