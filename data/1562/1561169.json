As he reflects on their past—from their first meeting in a Tel Aviv gay park and fleeting encounters with strangers to tender hikes, picnics, and the home they built together—he relives their intimacy and loss like a life flashing before his eyes. The film becomes a visual elegy, a meditation on memory, desire, and the eternal search for beauty within love, even as it fades.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aDbk4JHvhyxrbCjbjr8w2i7Pi1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redreaming Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
