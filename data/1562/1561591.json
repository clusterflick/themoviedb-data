As he sets out to film the monument’s troubled legacy, the camera itself seems to resist: double 8 mm footage begins to glitch and tremble. This formal revolt provides the opportunity to transform a personal inquiry into a haunting meditation on the endurance of fascist symbols in public space, and the difficulty of capturing them without reinforcing their presence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How (Not) to Film a Fascist Monument","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3121798,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lorenz Zenleser","original_name":"Lorenz Zenleser","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec3d53a4dea7aca4a72781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dutch premiere - Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
