Through intimate testimonies, the film preserves the memories of those who came of age under regimes of repression and later witnessed the slow emergence of queer visibility and rights in Southern Europe. Each story reveals the personal cost of survival and the quiet power of endurance — tracing how love, friendship, and activism have allowed queer lives to outlast prejudice. Moving between private recollection and collective history, the documentary builds a living archive that bridges generations and reclaims a legacy too often forgotten.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1WXTTQXTESGwgUY9ijEBnR0wPzP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In
