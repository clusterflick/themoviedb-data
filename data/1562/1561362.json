Many of them were “seasonal workers”, a unique status in Europe and one that was particularly iniquitous. These workers were allowed to stay in Switzerland only nine months of the year and were obliged to return home for the other three months; they were not allowed to change jobs; they could not have their own accommodation but had to live in what was provided by their employers; they were not allowed to bring their spouses and children with them. Tens of thousands of people lived in sub-standard accomodation that was often dangerous and endured particularly tough work conditions, especially in construction, but also in agriculture and the hotel industry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1tJKwpMIUhhwtTKCtvic1len89Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasonal Workers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Seasonal Workers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Mayenfisch","original_name":"Alex Mayenfisch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ebcd580a47a461f8645d50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Mayenfisch","original_name":"Alex Mayenfisch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ebcd72a6651b276d9fdec6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Séchaud","original_name":"Denis Séchaud","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/whhcxP5esvo88FM80QT6qgvK2eR.jpg","credit_id":"68ebcd8f4ffbcb7e429fdd5c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1024,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1tJKwpMIUhhwtTKCtvic1len89Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":729}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
