The collection includes four of Linder's American-made productions, meticulously restored from archival materials: THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES (1922, a parody of The Three Musketeers), SEVEN YEARS BAD LUCK (1921, a masterpiece of physical comedy), and the romantic farces BE MY WIFE (1921) and MAX WANTS A DIVORCE (1917).\r THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES\r U.S. 1922 Color Tinted 57 Min.\r Written and Directed by Max Linder","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3AhCZfEpeFnfjodFsX4lhu9FGmL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39134,"logo_path":"/sijjN3vMtjCnc1LkCM7HSBErcO3.png","name":"Kino Lorber","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max Linder Collection 1917-1922","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3AhCZfEpeFnfjodFsX4lhu9FGmL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
