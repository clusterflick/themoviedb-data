In a careful observational style, this film visits six regional waste processing sites around Amsterdam, revealing how discarded matter travels through intricate systems of sorting, processing, transport and deposition. Effortlessly shifting between scales, from granular substances to territorial transformations, Artifacts of Accumulation invites us to reflect on the metabolism of cities and the reality of circular economies.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artifacts of Accumulation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5745759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolien Schippers","original_name":"Carolien Schippers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec30918c3c90444f9de923","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romea Muryn","original_name":"Romea Muryn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec31c073315f0094282184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Lobo","original_name":"Francisco Lobo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec31df37c9f69e779de8f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38599459","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Premiere - Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
