Woman","overview":"In the first months of 1971, the Doors wrapped up the recording of L.A. Woman, an album that found them severing ties with their longtime producer Rothchild; he was replaced by Bruce Botnick. Extending the harder sound of Morrison Hotel, L.A. Woman appeared in the spring of 1971 accompanied by the single \"Love Her Madly.\" The single went to 11 on Billboard's Top 40, followed by a number 14 placement for the moody \"Riders on the Storm,\" with the album reaching nine on the album chart. The group's comeback was short-lived: Jim Morrison was found dead on July 3, 1971, just weeks after the release of L.A. Woman.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eTXaQ4zdWWFF3IZanahnwm7SpZD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: The Doors - L.A.
