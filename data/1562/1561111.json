From its founding roots in the 1970s, through the communal soup kitchens of the pandemic, to the current perspective of Luisa Maraboli, a symbol of female leadership, the documentary weaves a choral portrait of identity, territory, and self-management. More than a local story, it is a declaration of existence: at the top of the hill, people not only survive, they create, love, and start over.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/p4cKPfg1VT9ZGEjKkOJDbfPmshy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265407,"logo_path":null,"name":"MER","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"At the top of the hill, people don't just survive.
