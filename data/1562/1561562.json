As demolition loses its appeal, cities are rethinking how to care for, adapt and eventually celebrate their modernist heritage. The film’s title is a free translation of the French Grand Ensemble, a term that once evoked collective ambitions and architectural utopias. Today, these estates stand at the crossroads. Through four case studies, in Rome, Toulouse, Belgrade and Vienna, introduced by a single local voice, the film charts four different ways to deal with modernist mass housing: transformation, demolition, privatisation, and long-term maintenance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Together","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5745719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rocio Calzado","original_name":"Rocio Calzado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec2c0b035fbfa773a7271d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5745720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jasper Meurer","original_name":"Jasper Meurer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ec2c1cfcac09be85a213b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"European Premiere - Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
