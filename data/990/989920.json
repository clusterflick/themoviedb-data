I went to hike Colorado Trail to find the reasons why do I hike. This was independent project and the movie was filmed, edited and written by myself. It was challenging to carry all of video equipment in my backpack, but I had a vision and a goal – I wanted to capture my inner reasons why I do hike and why do I always go back to long distance hiking. \"","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":"/zOE1TIfFOpzPPCPcwILesmCid7Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42895,"logo_path":"/ygpDcAmydnkwZ1NSCbJfh3Z2xqs.png","name":"Ananda Media","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Do I Hike","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikola Horvat","original_name":"Nikola Horvat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b04bf390ea4b0e49f96cb7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikola Horvat","original_name":"Nikola Horvat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b04bd02b93200061353362","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikola Horvat","original_name":"Nikola Horvat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b04af5a6a4c10fd8319d83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikola Horvat","original_name":"Nikola Horvat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b04bc790ea4b0e470bb6d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikola Horvat","original_name":"Nikola Horvat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b04c075684630092b360f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lRpCW5nRG4Gme2RjeFCfXpSaug0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zOE1TIfFOpzPPCPcwILesmCid7Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2020-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WHY?
