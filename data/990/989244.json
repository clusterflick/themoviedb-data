How would they communicate? (Certainly not in Italian!) In POP’s most ambitious production to date, Artistic Director Josh Shaw’s long-time dream of a bilingual Madama Butterfly comes to life at The Aratani Theatre in Little Tokyo. With a new libretto by Josh Shaw and Eiki Isomura, all Japanese roles will be sung in Japanese and all American roles will be sung in English. This is a co-production with Opera in the Heights (Houston). This production is sponsored in part by an Innovations Grant from Opera America.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/i7oxuLKClb7mGJN8KJNqgtNG0Rn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":188,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Certainly not in Italian","title":"Madama Butterfly 蝶々夫人 in Japanese and English Aratani Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3593408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter James Lake","original_name":"Peter James Lake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"B.F.
