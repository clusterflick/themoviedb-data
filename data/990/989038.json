In this black-and-white video, her first in this format, Martha Rosler explores the relationship between gastronomy, class and breeding. A silhouetted woman hiding her face from the camera describes her efforts to improve her status and that of her family through gastronomy. With a deadpan voice and accompanied by the strains of a violin concerto, the woman explains why she wants to become a gourmet. The text comes from one of Rosler’s ‘postcard novels’ entitled Budding Gourmet – also written in 1974 – in which in eleven chapters the artists tells the story in the first person of a woman wanting to learn haute cuisine to climb the social ladder.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/q0R4SqL3Wg7u5BkNpSxALNIzlWM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Budding Gourmet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Rosler","original_name":"Martha Rosler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2t6W0F7XUl3bjxx5aQBeMu34N7e.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62adaebdbdc34c044a30252c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Rosler","original_name":"Martha Rosler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2t6W0F7XUl3bjxx5aQBeMu34N7e.jpg","credit_id":"62adaec9944a5703e6e11b45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4477992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1885,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q0R4SqL3Wg7u5BkNpSxALNIzlWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1257}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
