The storyline shuttles from Incheon to Daegu, where the social-activist priest Jang does his best to help the immigrants with their claims for compensation, severance pay and employment rights. Fine, eye-opening stuff, rather well acted by the non-pro cast – which includes Choi himself.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even No Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyen Dnc Thu","original_name":"Nguyen Dnc Thu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad9391d2b20902f3d78244","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mangala Sanjeewa Kodeethwskku","original_name":"Mangala Sanjeewa Kodeethwskku","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad93991bf26601094c26aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Choi Chang-hwan","original_name":"최창환","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/1wa3ZC2yBAuWGyzKEmSwuCLUGmG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad93a1d2b20902f4d7cf9d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Choi Chang-hwan","original_name":"최창환","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/1wa3ZC2yBAuWGyzKEmSwuCLUGmG.jpg","credit_id":"62ad93ab6f31af03a76636ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
