The pair worked as a husband-and-wife team in the eye of the storm, in Berlin and the blood-soaked fields of Eastern Europe, devising ever-more daring gambits to save any life they could, even as death surrounded them. The history is dramatically narrated by the couple’s daughter Cornelia, who was called into her parents’ confidence as a young child, and was imbued with an inner-strength that guided her work decades later as a journalist, politician and as the Federal Comissioner for Foreigner’s Affairs.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/w4sCc1SavCkrHF86BvZPKbNzRU5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Tale of a Courageous Family","title":"Two Trees in Jerusalem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16436502","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhhniNdpLeLDmnUeUifTqDhkMCr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42ulX0n7jkMyuEJlFxT5xAJUIx9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/O69j8Q3KkfhnZ3iCgNhLtp6gyK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iB7DpfFcDmOLihDBMrWMOdwvBdn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w4sCc1SavCkrHF86BvZPKbNzRU5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Miami Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Two Trees in Jerusalem (2022)- Official Trailer","key":"VQ3Npe6T_Sw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-05T14:50:04.000Z","id":"62ae336e4f33ad0060f16703"}]}}}
