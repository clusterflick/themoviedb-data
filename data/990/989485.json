The film follows their 300-day drama.  Kagawa's parents divorced when he was a child and he was never allowed to see his father. She has always wondered what her father was like. Kagawa has held on to this thought for some time. Then, in September 2011, she suddenly announced her intention to enter the Kabuki world. Her father, Ennosuke, also attracted attention when he announced his return to the stage eight years after suffering a stroke.  Then began their epic days together. Kagawa stayed at home and spent every day practising. His father, Ennosuke, battled with screaming pain and devoted himself to rehabilitation, while at the same time training his son, Kagawa. Father and son are driven by Kabuki, as if they are trying to regain something they have lost.","popularity":0.1588,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"父と子 市川猿翁・香川照之","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teruyuki Kagawa","original_name":"香川照之","popularity":1.1264,"profile_path":"/1jYpXpMcBPKWVcuunGy5twqSzVJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62af0f122b93200051ce57be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaharu Fukuyama","original_name":"福山雅治","popularity":0.5181,"profile_path":"/nQzW8rkEh9unI1BbzRpinRW2SsH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62af0f1a7f1d83050fa1ff23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2988874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ichikawa Ennosuke III","original_name":"Ichikawa Ennosuke III","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f6b2afffc9de00e132a069","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
