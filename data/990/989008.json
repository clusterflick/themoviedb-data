Two boys from a working-class family grow up as best friends. One is the son of a farmer, the other of a Thai-Chinese greengrocer. In a childhood scene, we see the boys wondering how to get ahead in life. Instead of the usual options - showbiz or Thai boxing - they choose to follow in the footsteps of their fathers: one wants to become a rowing champion and the other leader of a dragon dance group. The film is a simple moral tale of fathers and sons, good and bad influences, honor and shame. The screenplay breathes the atmosphere of early Thai cinema with a strong melodramatic tone, but its exaggeration and predictability are offset by the dynamic camera work and editing, the decent acting and the unusual glimpse into the world of the Chinese minority in Thailand.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":"/XmntjUCkIpq7DtLDClEGyhYgTO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1997-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams and Honour","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Pua Puen, Pua Fun, Pua Wan Kiattoyot","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"For Friends, For Dreams, For Days of Honor","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anchelee Davies","original_name":"Anchelee Davies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad927555c1f4005191022b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Attaporn Thimakorn","original_name":"Attaporn Thimakorn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad927fbdc34c008b3d9fa1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wattana Kamtorntip","original_name":"Wattana Kamtorntip","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad928931234500527d22b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Varavut Burapachayanon","original_name":"Varavut Burapachayanon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62ad92966f31af03a65b2f4e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarawut Wichiensarn","original_name":"Sarawut Wichiensarn","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ad92001bf26600e6930f25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592790,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sutos Ruengjui","original_name":"Sutos Ruengjui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ad923fbdc34c0061408643","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592789,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wimol Srainimnuan","original_name":"Wimol Srainimnuan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ad9224944a5703e5b932b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592792,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"M.L.
