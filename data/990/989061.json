At the time, such fears were treated as evidence of incompatibility with the new capitalist order and thus consistently relegated to the margins of public debate. The film is an attempt to recall the traumatic experiences of this period.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/wVQMLhxRf2tBE9zhD4Lq15iI1Oc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Earth Will Swallow It All","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Ritszel","original_name":"Dominik Ritszel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62adba4455c1f40061ed1f27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4303628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Piotr Ceglarek","original_name":"Piotr Ceglarek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c0ef6ea84c700ca093ca9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":948,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wVQMLhxRf2tBE9zhD4Lq15iI1Oc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Short Waves Festival","release_date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ars Independent Festival","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
