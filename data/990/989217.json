Pushed to the brink, theirs is a story of rescue, return, and compassion. The 14-year-old son, Bent Melchior, later became Chief Rabbi of Denmark. He narrates his own story along with the Danish actress Ina-Miriam Rosenbaum. This animation gives a new kind of visual life to this important chapter of history, bringing it to new generations.","popularity":0.0525,"poster_path":"/vDl2wHMgQBNv5ZXguj1ITUCcMR8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Denmark.
