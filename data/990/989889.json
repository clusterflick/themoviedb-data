On Sydney’s urban fringe, two young women battle for a better life in the underground world of competitive street dance. Patricia, Romanian-born and hanging out for a visa, is a breakdancer. Gabi, of Chilean-Samoan heritage, pops with power. Both dream of escaping the rough hand they’ve been dealt. Will a win at Australia’s biggest dance competition Destructive Steps – in which 60 contestants compete in the preliminary rounds - be their golden ticket? Or will the external pressures of financial hardship and volatile relationships stop them from even reaching the dancefloor?","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/z8p7sF1VXHbqOCJYZkT9bikbNQN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biscuit Tin Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Performance is power.","title":"Keep Stepping","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip Busfield","original_name":"Philip Busfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b012dd1cfe3a0377912d9b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Cornish","original_name":"Luke Cornish","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b012cc1cfe3a0379f8e124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595174,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frace Mercado","original_name":"Frace Mercado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65958664a698cf588e43a016","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Cornish","original_name":"Luke Cornish","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6595865f0e64af3d048c18e9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595173,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Geoff Blee","original_name":"Geoff Blee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65958669a698cf588e43a01c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15671312","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BiscuitTinProductions","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z8p7sF1VXHbqOCJYZkT9bikbNQN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z9R99cj851Eo6BuXm858lZRsyBL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Keep Stepping – Trailer – SFF 22","key":"jJlwheamacA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-05T11:10:19.000Z","id":"62f83dc9f92532009229dc29"}]}}}
