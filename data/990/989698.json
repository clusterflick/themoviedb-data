Back at his restaurant, sitting at a table, he starts talking, facing the camera. Who is he? René  Orduña. Neither hero nor victim, Rene is only a witness of his own existence during the 70s and 80s in the United States. A period of nomadism, geographical and amorous, whose only reference points were festive, this is what he evokes, without regret or nostalgia: the hypothesis of joy. And the film makes room for this word, playing with colors and sounds as cushions where it can be properly seated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y3gNZ838lZpQDxsxJQCtTMk0lp1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"René O.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3594665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Orduña","original_name":"Rene Orduña","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62af8e947f1d83050fa246af","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Bauer","original_name":"Thomas Bauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62af8f1262e86f006084c990","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/y3gNZ838lZpQDxsxJQCtTMk0lp1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
