Catering primarily to a gay clientele, the bar had 4 stories to move around in: 2 dance floors, a piano bar/pool room, and a rooftop terrace. Every night you could hear disco on one floor, new wave/rock on another, jazz standards in the basement and then chill on the roof overlooking historic Fenway Park Stadium.
