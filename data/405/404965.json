What is often overlooked, however, is the literary importance of the Somme: more writers and poets fought in it than in any other battle in history.  Narrated by Michael Sheen, War of Words: Soldier-Poets of the Somme details the experiences of the poets and writers who served in the battle. The work of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, David Jones, Isaac Rosenberg and JRR Tolkien (who arrived at the Western Front with ambitions to be a poet) was informed and transformed by the battle. Taken together, their experiences allow us to see this dreadful historical event through multiple points of view.  The film uses animation, documentary accounts, surviving artefacts, battalion war diaries and the landscape itself to reconnect this literature to the events that inspired it.","popularity":0.7335,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parapet Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":12935,"logo_path":"/rml1bBbFJ33HE0rTrkNpuFVfpAQ.png","name":"BBC Arts","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War of Words: Soldier-Poets of the Somme","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Sheen","original_name":"Michael Sheen","popularity":2.1903,"profile_path":"/iKHKWahPQYuxJSjXf8ZEmEZD9wZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"577c7d33925141110a003132","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Barton","original_name":"Peter Barton","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - First World War Historian","credit_id":"577c7d63925141573e001f33","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Egremont","original_name":"Max Egremont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Biographer, Siegfried Sassoon","credit_id":"577c7d85c3a3683fe2001df4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Fricker","original_name":"Christophe Fricker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Literary Historian","credit_id":"577c7db0c3a368616200349c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Garth","original_name":"John Garth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Author, Tolkien and the Great War","credit_id":"577c7dcfc3a3683ed200205d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Graves","original_name":"William Graves","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Son of Robert Graves","credit_id":"577c7dee9251411111003266","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Moorcroft Wilson","original_name":"Jean Moorcroft Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself - Biographer, Siegfried Sassoon","credit_id":"577c7e0a925141111d003351","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul O'Prey","original_name":"Paul O'Prey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself - Editor, Selected Poems: Robert Graves","credit_id":"577c7e35925141111100329b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathon Riley","original_name":"Jonathon Riley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Royal Welch Fusiliers","credit_id":"577c7e6ec3a36861500034e8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Stallworthy","original_name":"Jon Stallworthy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Editor, The Oxford Book of War Poetry","credit_id":"577c7e9092514157b8001eaa","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Steel","original_name":"Nigel Steel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself - Principal Historian, Imperial War Museums","credit_id":"577c7eb1925141573e002020","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645976,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Symmons Roberts","original_name":"Michael Symmons Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself - Poet","credit_id":"577c7ecf92514157b8001edd","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Zeepvat","original_name":"Charlotte Zeepvat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Herself - Biographer, W.N.
