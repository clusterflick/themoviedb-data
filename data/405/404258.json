Each films the world around them and intimately reflects on their individual struggles with making films. Kore-eda self-consciously reflects on his process, “What does a camera shoot? What does a film capture? The emptiness in my life reflects in my work.” Kawase concentrates on her everyday life and candid moments with her friends, who say, “Hang in there Naomi we are all on your side,” and, “You never keep the promises you make, but I love you anyway.”","popularity":0.2431,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This World (A Correspondence Between Naomi Kawase and Hirokazu Koreeda)","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Arashiyo (Oufuku Shokan: Kawase Naomi x Koreeda Hirokazu)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"This World (Winter)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirokazu Kore-eda","original_name":"是枝裕和","popularity":1.1456,"profile_path":"/9Quu2Jo5ItVgs8V1YPCaLEHc8y1.jpg","credit_id":"625ca7cfbf09d10066be95bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirokazu Kore-eda","original_name":"是枝裕和","popularity":1.1456,"profile_path":"/9Quu2Jo5ItVgs8V1YPCaLEHc8y1.jpg","credit_id":"625caadad38b5817adc76294","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Kawase","original_name":"河瀨直美","popularity":0.3904,"profile_path":"/87ETduqOsnFELgm6mkh1URrpDts.jpg","credit_id":"57742b0d9251417fd4001fc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hirokazu Kore-eda","original_name":"是枝裕和","popularity":1.1456,"profile_path":"/9Quu2Jo5ItVgs8V1YPCaLEHc8y1.jpg","credit_id":"57742b16c3a3687035002103","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
