Tracing her career from pin-up girl, to New Wave model of sexual freedom, to drug-dealing granny in the film Paulette, by way of La Fiancée du Pirate and Les Stances à Sophie, this film pays tribute to her extraordinary life and artistic odyssey. Her grand-daughters, Anna, Juliette and Solène, revisit the dreams of Bernadette, in the family home in the Cevennes region where they, like her, grew up. Her close friends, Bulle Ogier and Jean-Pierre Kalfon, reminisce on their artistic and human complicity. Throughout the film, Bernadette Lafont in person, with her inimitable character actress voice, re-evokes a life in cinema marked with insolence, courage and freedom.","popularity":0.3183,"poster_path":"/a2lxZHVQAq0QYPMirx1nhnsPUgM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16452,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lapsus","origin_country":""},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernadette Lafont, and God Created the Free Woman","video":false,"vote_average":6.917,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Lafont","original_name":"Bernadette Lafont","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/eN4yXWW69DE0XpfKG09pziQclJ4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5776528c9251416dd60022c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980918,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Michel Demonteix","original_name":"Michel Demonteix","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"628ca34e7d5db51b2b94bdfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Kalfon","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Kalfon","popularity":0.294,"profile_path":"/r55H3IrpdYD8Dq04PpboZCmmiPB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57765273c3a3684f6c001de0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Medveczky","original_name":"Anna Medveczky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5776527e9251417ee3001d68","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bulle Ogier","original_name":"Bulle Ogier","popularity":0.5224,"profile_path":"/lS4b8sdG6u2IBo7cBPTqNSqAq2O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57765284c3a3685031001f9b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esther Hoffenberg","original_name":"Esther Hoffenberg","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577652629251414919002e17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5721732","wikidata_id":"Q24705493","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62eMKZ3CGn5XZAOsLVqOdWUPQiy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/a2lxZHVQAq0QYPMirx1nhnsPUgM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema","release_date":"2017-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jerusalem Film Festival","release_date":"2016-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
