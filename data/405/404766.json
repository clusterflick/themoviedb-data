These people, who experienced the twentieth century's bloodiest war as Soviet soldiers, immigrated to Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union and found themselves in a society that is totally indifferent to their glorious past. The film offers a close and compassionate look at the veterans' lives, fueled by complexity, pain, and an almost silent insult, alongside joy and self-deprecating humor. The feeling of living on borrowed time drives the veterans to embark on what may be their last adventure.","popularity":0.2815,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yes Doco","origin_country":""},{"id":15,"logo_path":"/2GukAxjXAF3Qf4GosI6WzIgljL3.png","name":"Lama Films","origin_country":"PS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veterans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644945,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ayelet Kait","original_name":"Ayelet Kait","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57799b609251415ede001eed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amir Harel","original_name":"Amir Harel","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57799b709251415ede001ef5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644943,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tanya Aizikovich","original_name":"Tanya Aizikovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57799b0ec3a3682002001ea1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644943,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tanya Aizikovich","original_name":"Tanya Aizikovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57799b069251416d06001a6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644943,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tanya Aizikovich","original_name":"Tanya Aizikovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57799b4f9251415fbe001f01","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644943,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tanya Aizikovich","original_name":"Tanya Aizikovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64550b17d8f44e0db0727202","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4011542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":160224,"name":"post world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
