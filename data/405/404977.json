Hahamishia Hakamerit was broadcast on Israeli Channel 2 and Channel 1 between the years 1993-1997. Later on, reruns of the show were broadcast on the cable channel Bip (channel).  The show's often surreal skits were characterized by a satirical point of view which did not spare the audience sensitive subjects such as politics, national security, the Holocaust and sex.","popularity":0.6016,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matara Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cameric Five In Green","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Ha-Hamishia Hakamerit","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"החמישייה הקאמרית בירוק","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"החמישייה הקאמרית","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"החמישיה הקאמרית","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shai Avivi","original_name":"Shai Avivi","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/6guZUYJ5hSXQOiWxuVNlccihVZ2.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Various","credit_id":"577bda1ec3a3684399000bfb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rami Heuberger","original_name":"Rami Heuberger","popularity":0.3174,"profile_path":"/1PADvclr48hzDnosb2iwpA84Eq1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Various","credit_id":"577bda329251411f56000853","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keren Mor","original_name":"קרן מור","popularity":0.3242,"profile_path":"/kB05N0kscsiGS0BEqH4YVEU4GmA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Various","credit_id":"577bda45c3a36862880003c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dov Navon","original_name":"Dov Navon","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/eiyXMfafO6xMHAFbpGzvYslrr8E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Various","credit_id":"577bda539251411ea2000863","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Menashe Noy","original_name":"מנשה נוי","popularity":0.3493,"profile_path":"/dS0KM4vNOXb6A3Aij7jt0yRuOnX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Various","credit_id":"577bda669251412f4c0003aa","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1398473,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amnon Zlayet","original_name":"Amnon Zlayet","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/v6zEZ21Y9Dx5UFxIAy6VCKRPTai.jpg","credit_id":"645516a2c044290122ccacf5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47104,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avi Koren","original_name":"Avi Koren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645516abd8f44e0dae96e257","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itai Neeman","original_name":"Itai Neeman","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645516b087a27a0138a75608","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55046,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Etgar Keret","original_name":"Etgar Keret","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":"/2E009TQjmDgKOb6WoibjI2vHvJb.jpg","credit_id":"5faa5d207314a1003db088b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe El Dror","original_name":"Joe El Dror","popularity":0.1112,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faa5d292f3b17003ef0af03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231072,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Uzi Weil","original_name":"Uzi Weil","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faa5d34e2bca8004298aecd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1255799,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Eitan Zur","original_name":"Eitan Zur","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faa5d5ed6d64d003e77d376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":5598,"name":"tel aviv, israel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
