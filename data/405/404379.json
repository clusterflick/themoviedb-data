This one-off documentary uses never-before seen footage, interviews and reconstructions to tell the story of the twins’ lives from 1968 until their deaths. From their 30-day trial and Ronnie Kray’s committal to Broadmoor - following his diagnosis as insane - to operations on the outside and the twins' various marriages inside.  A number of the subjects interviewed for the documentary had first-hand dealings with the Krays, including Wilf Pine, Ronnie Kray’s business manager; Freddie Foreman, who was sentenced at the same time as the Krays for the disposal of the body of Jack ‘the hat’ McVitie; and Maureen Flanagan, a close family friend and former model who Reggie proposed to three times whilst in prison.","popularity":0.1294,"poster_path":"/22auVYoKykAPGxxyVo8XqmKdReX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodcut Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Prison Years","title":"The Krays - The Prison Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Maddock","original_name":"Neil Maddock","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Reggie Kray","credit_id":"5775940a925141673d00013e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Merritt","original_name":"Tony Merritt","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ronnie Kray","credit_id":"5775941ec3a368090d00014d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643645,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matt Blyth","original_name":"Matt Blyth","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577594a0c3a36808f2000175","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Hulland","original_name":"Louise Hulland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57759471c3a3680902000167","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643645,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matt Blyth","original_name":"Matt Blyth","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5775959692514167520001f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1643643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Beal","original_name":"Kate Beal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577594549251416741000156","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5503310","wikidata_id":"Q27038221","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22auVYoKykAPGxxyVo8XqmKdReX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Documentary","release_date":"2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
