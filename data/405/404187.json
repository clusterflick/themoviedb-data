A British diplomat had been kidnapped, a Québec cabinet minister murdered. The troops were brought in as a safeguard. This film is a vigorous reflection of the discussions and analyses of the situation that went on wherever people gathered, voicing attitudes and fears, sympathies and concerns.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":"/94OVBkeE9N7U1XAzArnkDW0UYqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reaction: A Portrait of a Society in Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1643051,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Normand Cloutier","original_name":"Normand Cloutier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5773a4d6c3a368725c0008bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":621794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Spry","original_name":"Robin Spry","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/tZ99dhOqCaeSMrf4rHaNQ7c8hTo.jpg","credit_id":"5773a481c3a368233f0018d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":621794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Spry","original_name":"Robin Spry","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/tZ99dhOqCaeSMrf4rHaNQ7c8hTo.jpg","credit_id":"5773a49ec3a368730a000715","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1643052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shelagh Mackenzie","original_name":"Shelagh Mackenzie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5773a4e8c3a368725c0008ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4ab2989a3c490014312c99","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223994","wikidata_id":"Q7300245","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/94OVBkeE9N7U1XAzArnkDW0UYqG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
