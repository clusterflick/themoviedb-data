[has] been hailed as [a] classic of the new wave. [The tape] juxtaposes fragments from a soap opera with sequences of ice skating races. The graceful movements of the skaters punctuate repeated excerpts from a dreadfully intense discussion between a doctor and his patient: ‘He doesn't do anything, doesn't say anything.... It's just the way he looks at me.... That sound crazy?’ The narrative builds up slowly as a few more words of the deadly dialogue are released. Extended in this way, the pathos is bare, the narrative content becomes meaningless and the result is particularly moving.\" --Katherine Elwes, Performance (July/August 1981)","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/hNYMpZUySHVtkpJ46Z1JYx2UcbM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pop Pop Video","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dara Birnbaum","original_name":"Dara Birnbaum","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57720e35c3a36824650033a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hNYMpZUySHVtkpJ46Z1JYx2UcbM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
