But, through his creative determination, he finds patronage in Jong Jans and Jong's wife, Almeri. Abraham and Katie settle into their new home, working for Jong and Almeri, but Katie's battles with mental illness and alcoholism rock the boat. Abraham staunchly supports his wife, but his own ambitions as an artist make him restless. Abraham is a dreamer who wishes to rise above his station in life and make his mark on the world, but the realities of his circumstances get in the way of happiness.
