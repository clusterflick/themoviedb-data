There are no records of the cameraman’s name – which is a pity since today the most attractive aspect of this film are views of old St. Petersburg. The capital of Russia was by no means the capital of Russian filmmaking: until the mid-1920s Moscow was miles ahead both in experimental and commercial cinema. With only a dozen surviving films from St. Petersburg this one is an important rediscovery.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silken Web","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1642903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jurij Jur’evskij","original_name":"Jurij Jur’evskij","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5772fd0c9251415acd00020e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
