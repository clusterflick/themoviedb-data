When Rowan is taken away from the civilized world, his lessons in the wild begin. Yet when he shatters the balance of nature, Rowan discovers another world beneath our own. In that shadowy land of old gods and wild hunts, the divide between man and beast becomes uncertain and the fairy-tales of his childhood spring to life. With only the guidance of a hunting hawk, Rowan must make amends for his crime against nature, and choose between what is real, and what is fantasy.","popularity":0.223,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hawk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gwyn Davin","original_name":"Robert Gwyn Davin","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Rowan (adult)","credit_id":"673aa04e3c831a132953cb61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Madoc","original_name":"Philip Madoc","popularity":0.2957,"profile_path":"/bs1qNserVwEbRBLIvzxoSVRmLMW.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Gawain","credit_id":"673aa0583c831a132953cb6a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5065845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffan Thomas","original_name":"Steffan Thomas","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Rowan (boy)","credit_id":"673aa06c3c831a132953cb7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5065846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Maw","original_name":"Joanna Maw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"673aa0795859f981eedfe049","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579020,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"M.J.
