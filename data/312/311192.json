Not a good movie, not a bad either. The ending is abrupt and artificial, which seems to be a common plague of Third Reich's crime movies. Gustav Fröhlich could never get rid of his silent era mannerisms and overacting. But on the other side, this film is not boring and has to offer some decent plot turns and acting.","popularity":0.2678,"poster_path":"/eYOTr9nh0lTXwfM3ZZyzt4hnMnM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1944-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der große Preis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Fröhlich","original_name":"Gustav Fröhlich","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/bkjDaorTT3LcOeTcQF1TDpBlHwt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Westhoff","credit_id":"548e092a92514122ea005158","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Wernicke","original_name":"Otto Wernicke","popularity":0.2057,"profile_path":"/xHWKwyOG7JyqUDoKQmbOnk5wJB5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Obermeister Kramp","credit_id":"548e0938c3a3684ea1004a3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carola Höhn","original_name":"Carola Höhn","popularity":0.2765,"profile_path":"/AlRenogTA3QVL4HFUbMDGxXz3jn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fanny","credit_id":"548e095292514122ed0051de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruni Löbel","original_name":"Bruni Löbel","popularity":0.1921,"profile_path":"/wkikHJaNxkwkz6aGjjLXbTpM8P7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anneliese","credit_id":"548e0962925141031b001487","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Schafheitlin","original_name":"Franz Schafheitlin","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/waBnCjhX3M73pKaKDJFRyM7wKKN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Greininger","credit_id":"548e09c2c3a368153b002d23","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"O.E.
