This is a rotoscoped piece of animation created from three randomly selected pieces of found footage. The foundation of this piece is based in mathematics, chance and montage editing measured in increments of triangular numbers. After the Formalist groundwork was laid, elements of Surrealism were employed to take the film beyond the initial framework of the metric and rhythmic editing process. The pixels were playfully manipulated and melded together into an entirely new form, backed by a noise composition set into place without regard for pacing, only duration. Music by legendary noise musician Merzbow.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newscaster/Dragon/Maggots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masami Akita","original_name":"Masami Akita","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54905243c3a3686d74001d18","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Sagovac","original_name":"Chris Sagovac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54905622c3a3686d7c001c52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2848476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
