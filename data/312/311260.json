Some 95 years later, 40 Australians retraced their footsteps in living detail – from the foothills of the pyramids to the treacherous expanse of ANZAC Cove. Incorporating archival footage from the Australian War Memorial, interviews with historians, experts and authors, The Charge of The ANZACS is a detailed documentary account of Australia and New Zealand’s equine involvement in WWI. Following the Australian Light Horse Association’s attempt to re-enact the monumental journey, they commemorate the anniversary of the charge of Beersheba and explore the extraordinary lives of many fallen heroes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Charge of the Anzacs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CHARGE OF THE ANZACS, THE Trailer","key":"oDEX6Yal11A","published_at":"2014-12-15T06:01:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"548ef627c3a3685c3f001b23"}]}}}
