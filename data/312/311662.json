Firstly, Talbot Rothwell became ill whilst writing the script, and was unable to finish it. Dave Freeman had to be brought in to complete the script, but the two men did not work together. As a result, the script does not flow as easily as the earlier offerings. Secondly, Charles Hawtrey pulled out of the special at short notice. Having taken third billing to Sid James and Terry Scott in the previous two shows, and knowing they would both be absent, Hawtrey demanded top billing. But Carry On producer Peter Rogers refused, giving top billing to Hattie Jacques instead. Hawtrey's role had hastily to be recast, and was split between Norman Rossington and Brian Oulton, both of whom had played cameo roles in several Carry On films. The special featured a collection of historical sketches, loosely linked around an 18th-century banquet.","popularity":0.9343,"poster_path":"/c3Wl1O0AoxV7VzmemKLQ2A7FJp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/h9O2O30eqiYaNi8qRKclV2U4Wjw.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1972-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This time sees the cast acting out classic christmas panto Aladdin, singing bawdy Elizabethan songs and what's that going on in the Garden of Eden?","title":"Carry on Christmas (or Carry On Stuffing)","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Carry on Stuffing","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hattie Jacques","original_name":"Hattie Jacques","popularity":0.2764,"profile_path":"/n95sCWibvNbS3w4jnt8BwzK9ZrF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5490206592514122030015a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Sims","original_name":"Joan Sims","popularity":0.3487,"profile_path":"/zlqfbnRk85lAqt5ouKdA0JiQZRG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5490207092514122180013ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Windsor","original_name":"Barbara Windsor","popularity":0.404,"profile_path":"/nOAxChNw7qKnItlbZQs5kVtBx45.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54902086c3a3686d710012a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Butterworth","original_name":"Peter Butterworth","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":"/tkoFsJ8w2r9zeBtPqvcJ78pKwEc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"549020adc3a368269a000342","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Connor","original_name":"Kenneth Connor","popularity":0.3817,"profile_path":"/yqZIM8VPgJO2vL6bTN0DQTk4c1k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"549020ba92514122120015dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Rossington","original_name":"Norman Rossington","popularity":0.2208,"profile_path":"/l3sLtmYvdCUZuMywcOupkQkaLTn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"549020c9c3a368269a000346","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Douglas","original_name":"Jack Douglas","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/ilUwtqw7U1J3VuVaN4CMmQ6mdWO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"549020d592514122150014d8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Oulton","original_name":"Brian Oulton","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/uOgp6kuUPaeru6uX1BUAD4ySI67.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"549020ddc3a368269a000349","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Leon","original_name":"Valerie Leon","popularity":0.4888,"profile_path":"/1FPux9w3hjMPx9bP5fcxMYUcLuE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"549020ec925141220f0015b6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":184933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Cornelius","original_name":"Billy Cornelius","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"549020f9925141220b00155a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":193016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Stanton","original_name":"Valerie Stanton","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"54902103c3a3686d8200158a","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronnie Baxter","original_name":"Ronnie Baxter","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a25f0911386c00c590b92b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0187775","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c3Wl1O0AoxV7VzmemKLQ2A7FJp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11401,"name":"carry on"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
