From a Komodo dragon's virulent bacterial bite to a black widow spider poisoning her victim and a cobra devouring a rat (tail first), viewers get to see skin-crawling close-ups of Mother Nature's creepiest critters. Intriguing tidbits about each creature make the program as enlightening as it is hair-raising.","popularity":0.4332,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic Kids: Creepy Creatures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"National Geographic: Creepy Creatures","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Turner","original_name":"Kathleen Turner","popularity":1.3708,"profile_path":"/fItxvQb7Jp3DnP6fXOm30zvYYaM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clawdette the Black Cat (voice)","credit_id":"622e4a73688cd00071923418","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1893665,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Connie Rinehart","original_name":"Connie Rinehart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e4988a6fdaa001b7d639f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cynthia Van Cleef","original_name":"Cynthia Van Cleef","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e49760e4419001b6b45cd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cynthia Van Cleef","original_name":"Cynthia Van Cleef","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e496d21621d007a3604b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3464468,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jevon Heyliger","original_name":"Jevon Heyliger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e49bfafe2240046228976","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0420795","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
