With his first book written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy, something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books, Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two begin a tentative relationship in Sophie’s home town of Portland, Oregon, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry.  Liam’s agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel August’s true identity, but Sophie doesn’t know of his public persona. The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs for himself. Will their romance survive once his true identity comes to light?","popularity":1.495,"poster_path":"/cLgHUoemiSv3TqoCOnb8oiYdRVX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larkin-Goldstein Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"True love in false covers.","title":"A Novel Romance","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":83,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Write Man","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Acker","original_name":"Amy Acker","popularity":1.9587,"profile_path":"/9lpLwfscOoG4jyYIH761SRnm09U.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sophie Atkinson","credit_id":"548df61ac3a36820ba004a82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Bruce","original_name":"Dylan Bruce","popularity":0.7359,"profile_path":"/yGFyqKg96R6lyhXktpDvwjBZRQb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Liam Bradley","credit_id":"548df62fc3a36820b800539f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Tennant","original_name":"Emily Tennant","popularity":0.5576,"profile_path":"/7s4xgP16c3jIwKpWK8JGclo74Az.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tabitha","credit_id":"548e0320c3a36820c5005298","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1399273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tammy Gillis","original_name":"Tammy Gillis","popularity":0.394,"profile_path":"/qTAhgHG7cqZJrSBiUi3hGHJr43o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"548e03f3c3a36820be0044e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles S.
