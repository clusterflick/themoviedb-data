This mindful tale centers on the emperor of China and his pet nightingale, which sings like an angel but isn't much to look at. The songbird is a favorite of the royal court, but everything changes when the emperor gets a bejeweled mechanical nightingale. Other stories include \"Jack the Fool\" and \"The Galoshes of Fortune.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5XERxGIRmh9qbKtaGAPNrjFpTl0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starlight Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hans Christian Andersen: The Fairy Tales: The Nightingale & Other Stories","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5XERxGIRmh9qbKtaGAPNrjFpTl0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD compilation of three episodes from \"The Fairytaler\"","release_date":"2006-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
