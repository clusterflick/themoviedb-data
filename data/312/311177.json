It advocates surpassing the monetary system by introducing a resource-based economy, in which all of the world's resources are utilized for the common heritage of all people. With the advent of newer technologies, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology; and by nurturing individuality and creativity we could create abundance for everyone; not just a selected few. It presents future cities (on land and sea), architecture, efficient transportation, clean alternative energy systems, interviews with project founder and director, Jacque Fresco, and much more. It is an in-depth explanation of the direction and aims of The Venus Project.","popularity":0.1161,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacque Fresco","original_name":"Jacque Fresco","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/4ABJ5NanPcgptnZUWqFeX3fwQIA.jpg","credit_id":"548deaa5c3a368153b002803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1941722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
