This film centres on his unparalleled stardom, revealing how, alongside one of the most staggering musical careers in history, he has received rave reviews for his acting abilities, launched a clothing range, signed superstars like 50 Cent to his own record label, and grabbed the headlines with his explosive behaviour at every given opportunity. His ability to stay at the cutting edge whilst taking on these other challenges is investigated thoroughly using exclusive interviews, rare and previously unseen film footage photographs and comments from his family, friends, colleagues and [in some cases] enemies.","popularity":0.216,"poster_path":"/djibykCL09h20d1qUG8y4vlSETS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrome Dreams Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unauthorized Documentary of Eminem","title":"Eminem: The Glory Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djibykCL09h20d1qUG8y4vlSETS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":156137,"name":"music history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
