Worse still, Handel has lost his inspiration to compose. But when he overhears the singing of famous actress Susannah Cibber, Handel is moved to once again write some of the greatest music ever heard. King George II tasks him to create an oratorio to celebrate the new Irish Viceroy in chaotic Dublin.","popularity":0.8614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33616,"logo_path":"/XAMIOcQdxX4C0P5wdDrYsgz349.png","name":"Sprout Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolution Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":82963,"logo_path":"/u6Z0LZZsQeVelUsvjZDmEPvkHHL.png","name":"Lorton Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Hallelujah!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Fiennes","original_name":"Ralph Fiennes","popularity":5.2318,"profile_path":"/u29BOqiV5GCQ8k8WUJM50i9xlBf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"George Frideric Handel","credit_id":"5ae642180e0a261060003169","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicholas Adams","original_name":"Nicholas Adams","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae642829251410ccf0025e7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Eaton","original_name":"Andrew Eaton","popularity":0.1727,"profile_path":"/8NLEP2n3lvdvXCeWqeuopjPix9B.jpg","credit_id":"5ae643129251410ccf00261f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Croker","original_name":"Jon Croker","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/miH6limlqar1VBL3ED8ag4sxHKn.jpg","credit_id":"5ae64267c3a3681358003cd0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Addison","original_name":"Chris Addison","popularity":0.2838,"profile_path":"/pDPJrs1VBpqHpBIlMwuMIQ8s5zK.jpg","credit_id":"5ae6422a9251410d3d002b9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4580,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gina Carter","original_name":"Gina Carter","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae642a7c3a3681348003948","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8342896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":194063,"name":"messiah"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
