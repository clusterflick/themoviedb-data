Maurice is non-functional in most of the physical areas of marriage that count, but Stella attends to his other needs faithfully for three years. Then his brother, Colin, shows up from South America, and he and Stella fall passionately in love and are making plans to run away together. Mother Taylor is aware of the romance, as is Nurse Weyland, who is secretly in love with Maurice, and now hates Stella for her careless attitude toward Maurice's patiently-borne sufferings. Maurice is also aware of the affair. He has a talk with his wife and brother. Complications arise.","popularity":0.3086,"poster_path":"/hjzxQOl2VSaAjLQdDhIfNfEPEjK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sacred Flame","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Frederick","original_name":"Pauline Frederick","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/oZkkaaZf07bEa3LT0YXMoGlcqSm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Taylor","credit_id":"5f0f8e26a1074b003738f604","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Courtenay","original_name":"William Courtenay","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/legT04fQG1jgLt9FCPGyvRYRmZK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Major Laconda","credit_id":"5f0f8e2ba1074b003838f80f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Nagel","original_name":"Conrad Nagel","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/eq8mN5jfRlkKhU0AlOtbSTtZdeS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Col.
