It is formed as a triptych: the first part takes the viewer on a journey to the very roots of the image, the frame, the angle, the light, and the frozen movement of people, and contemplates stills and cinema photography. The second part revolves around three photographers whom Perlov deeply admired: David Seymore, Henri Lartigue, and Henri Roth (the latter's photographs served as evidence in the Eichmann Trial)","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":"/bHQcDWOnjZuoEgagwBwElPi9U7c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"my stills 1952-2002","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Perlov","original_name":"David Perlov","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/oXFHsE3rCXg7rNIobA9aSLwHthQ.jpg","credit_id":"5aea2a18c3a3682be10012b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2097538,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tamara Pilz Hunter","original_name":"Tamara Pilz Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b622724925141406a01cc41","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.637,"height":2259,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHQcDWOnjZuoEgagwBwElPi9U7c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
