Scotch spies a creepy yet interesting character stealing luggage, who then offers Scotch a ride into town if he will assist in dropping dirt and a frog-shaped flower pot into another man's car. Scotch, who is clearly several cards short of a full deck, complies and immediately earns the wrath of the car owner McDunley, a bearish sourpuss who runs the local video store and who has a mysterious long-running feud with Anderson, the luggage-thief who quickly becomes Scotch's new best friend.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":"/zvpFf1s9oNU7Oey8aAfKeTYJhbI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hale Manor Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Living, loving, and stealing luggage.","title":"Everything Moves Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Guerette","original_name":"Philip Guerette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Scotch Leary","credit_id":"5ae6a5379251417baa002521","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","original_name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Anderson","credit_id":"5ae6a6b6c3a36813510098f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Ford","original_name":"Matt Ford","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"McDunley","credit_id":"5ae6a5509251410ce4007042","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Angelillo","original_name":"Tina Angelillo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"5ae6a56e9251410d440051c6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1521191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Aransky","original_name":"Mike Aransky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rob Leary","credit_id":"5ae6a580c3a3681367005841","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Robinson","original_name":"Kelly Robinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5ae6a58fc3a368134e00a4f9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","original_name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae6a6140e0a26104f0069e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1521191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Aransky","original_name":"Mike Aransky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae6a59f0e0a261054006779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0286613","wikidata_id":"Q5418076","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zvpFf1s9oNU7Oey8aAfKeTYJhbI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
