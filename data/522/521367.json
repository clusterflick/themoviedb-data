The kingdom is then ruled by Wikramawardhana, son-in-law of Hayamwuruk. To rival Majapahit, Bre Wirabhumi creates the Pamotan kingdom and looks for allies amongst other kingdoms. This creates confusion among the kingdoms friendly with Majapahit. Brama Kumbara (Fendy Pradana) from the Madangkara kingdom tries to settle the dispute. What happens instead is a misunderstanding that leads to the death of Brama’s envoy. Even worst, the lover of the murderer, Lasmini (Murti Sari Dewi), takes revenge by kidnapping Brama’s wife. The conflict then escalates into the Paregreg war between Majapahit and Pamotan.","popularity":0.3509,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65106,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Kanta Indah Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1988-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saur Sepuh: The Knight of Madangkara","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","title":"Saur Sepuh I","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fendy Pradana","original_name":"Fendy Pradana","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/3Yep6jVjoIf5Z1qyVw0uvnykvGl.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Brama Kumbara","credit_id":"5ae67dd39251410cec00465c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1613025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anneke Putri","original_name":"Anneke Putri","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/1CA6iaPaIkel1G4mnaVWz8eO0j6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harnum","credit_id":"5ae67e05c3a3681358005f85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1520483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elly Ermawati","original_name":"Elly Ermawati","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mantili","credit_id":"5ae67e199251417baa0010b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murti Sari Dewi","original_name":"Murti Sari Dewi","popularity":0.0746,"profile_path":"/7k50pEHz8LSE3lQaR6kfK3bes2m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lasmini","credit_id":"5ae67e2ac3a368136a00400e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baron Hermanto","original_name":"Baron Hermanto","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/tlOcNBSZsvyYpowkRIZFFU8K7sW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae67e39c3a368136a004010","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hengky Tornando","original_name":"Hengky Tornando","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":"/9iSeb311q8rnhBr03xw6JKeSsGo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gotawa","credit_id":"5ae67e549251410ce400595a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1653939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chitra Dewi","original_name":"Chitra Dewi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/j3p7UTyD75KJiHNcM91F0r5KndT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae67e8a0e0a2610750053e0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sirjon De Gaut","original_name":"Sirjon De Gaut","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Wikramawardhana","credit_id":"5ae67eba0e0a261063005363","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harto Kawel","original_name":"Harto Kawel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bre Wirabhumi","credit_id":"5ae67f359251410cdc004e0f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":516525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Imam Tantowi","original_name":"Imam Tantowi","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae67f6b9251410cec004702","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614574,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Niki Kosasih","original_name":"Niki Kosasih","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae67fad0e0a26106c0052b6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":516525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Imam Tantowi","original_name":"Imam Tantowi","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae67ff49251410d3d004b01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614578,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harry Sabar","original_name":"Harry Sabar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae6801bc3a36813550082cf","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0326631","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3098,"name":"castle"},{"id":250111,"name":"saur sepuh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"1988-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
