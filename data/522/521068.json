Using a 35mm still camera, multiple exposures were composed and edited in-camera, creating frameless sequences of images printed on 35mm filmstrips. When projected, these images become a non-linear, non-synchronized collage. The ephemeral quality of the images—their transparency, layering, and repetition—invites us to reflect on the role memory plays in perception, the ways we mentally reconfigure fragments to construct stability and meaning in an environment of perpetual flux.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3kz324l9cjgWGXbKoAKj7uHj4y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronogram of Inexistent Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malena Szlam","original_name":"Malena Szlam","popularity":0.0781,"profile_path":"/1FqqGSxaU8iRwVtvBMZNuK2it6u.jpg","credit_id":"5ae4229c9251416ac30031ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11714250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3kz324l9cjgWGXbKoAKj7uHj4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
