Before long, the camorra learns of their actions, and their licenses to fish the local waters are revoked. With nowhere to turn, they head back to North African waters, but the behavior of one member of the crew starts to endanger the others on board. The partially improvised dialogue by the cast of mostly untrained actors is delivered in the local Neapolitan dialect, which lends great authenticity to the story.","popularity":0.1141,"poster_path":"/gHx3gem0NL6vI6fhvEHI3GeaUbK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2001-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailing Home","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15603,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramiro Civita","original_name":"Ramiro Civita","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659af36b1d1bf400971b3780","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincenzo Marra","original_name":"Vincenzo Marra","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9dd702a6e2d2001f4ff009","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20648,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Guerra","original_name":"Andrea Guerra","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/mqTi0J49NCqOwQjpM0Qu0vTquDK.jpg","credit_id":"5d9dd718a5046e001f83d0f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincenzo Marra","original_name":"Vincenzo Marra","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9dd70fa6e2d2001d501cb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298577","wikidata_id":"Q3993887","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHx3gem0NL6vI6fhvEHI3GeaUbK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
