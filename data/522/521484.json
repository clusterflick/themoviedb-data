From industrial China to the rural American south to contemporary Brooklyn, we observe the people and places that reproduce, consume and reclaim BLACK MEMORABILIA. This feature documentary takes us on a journey into the material culture of racialized artifacts and confronts us with the incendiary features of these objects. BLACK MEMORABILIA also moves beyond perverse attractions and absolute objections to collectibles and antiques that serve as reminders of America's troubled racial history. In the midst of roiling ethnic unrest in the US today, the film's confrontation of our feelings about these objects strikes at the heart of a pressing contemporary issue and opens a unique dialogue about the continuing legacy of racism in America.","popularity":0.2798,"poster_path":"/vRPoa0ua8JcgUaRYNhbHCQ87DY9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192983,"logo_path":null,"name":"C-Line Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Memorabilia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Colvard","original_name":"Chico Colvard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae737c8c3a3682e020054b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Colvard","original_name":"Chico Colvard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae7384f0e0a26107500ca9e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Colvard","original_name":"Chico Colvard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae73860c3a368135b006e28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Colvard","original_name":"Chico Colvard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae7386a9251410cec00a9e0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1605875,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hannah Buck","original_name":"Hannah Buck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae7387d0e0a26106c00c64d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937912,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Keiko Deguchi","original_name":"Keiko Deguchi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae73892c3a368134e012444","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robb Moss","original_name":"Robb Moss","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wNIfIUDxHZKEwPUP0XGR3MhJyku.jpg","credit_id":"5ae738a3c3a368136700a8ba","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heidi Ewing","original_name":"Heidi Ewing","popularity":0.1085,"profile_path":"/vmDT1aZpEzsNvDu7TLcseyPUfLJ.jpg","credit_id":"5ae738ac0e0a26105800badf","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Nelson","original_name":"Stanley Nelson","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/lRYyHCFY0U2RlMVJ7OpPYmkHMvA.jpg","credit_id":"5ae738ba0e0a26106600c7f7","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6098626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"blackmemorabilia","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/si8EtW4Z7ZI9lW1lRNnelecnX3C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vRPoa0ua8JcgUaRYNhbHCQ87DY9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eIrRn7xGTPoDpfe2fjuChqfmdxa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1847,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kKqWFhyzQExKoQv4SflIrOeQXAQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1231}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
