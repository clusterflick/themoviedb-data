This is how the author sees this annual hustle and bustle and weaves an equally bizarre event around it, which focuses on the love of a Munich exterminator for the daughter of a Saxon high school teacher. He equips the story with a monstrous inventory of secondary characters, who provide plenty of linguistic and social misunderstandings.","popularity":0.1319,"poster_path":"/tOeXx7W692RWhhyGODbfMekj0md.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66769,"logo_path":null,"name":"DÃ¼rer-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1968-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'S Wiesenhendl","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Pongratz","original_name":"Alfred Pongratz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dienstmann","credit_id":"5ae4ff1e92514156790000ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erni Singerl","original_name":"Erni Singerl","popularity":0.2313,"profile_path":"/u80t4Js3bFDoG5Nu6H1oaQ7LaAb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ella","credit_id":"5ae4ff29c3a3685c07000081","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Prikopa","original_name":"Herbert Prikopa","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tante Valevska","credit_id":"5ae4ff3f0e0a2658a4000147","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1330725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Else Rambausek","original_name":"Else Rambausek","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/j8Ae0LnQpvbfmtHHIxAVgRWlLBs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Theres","credit_id":"5afb190c0e0a26231b002ffd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Wilhelm","original_name":"Kurt Wilhelm","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae4ff0c0e0a26580600012f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando","original_name":"Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8f40516728a8002989f1ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0486166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tOeXx7W692RWhhyGODbfMekj0md.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
