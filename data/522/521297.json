Gone underground in the solitude of the Italian Maremma, he evades questions of morality and ethics. Nathan returns to the roots of photography and falls in love with the interior designer Ewa, a clever and pretty young woman who opens up completely new sides of life for him. The medial flood of information accusing his brother Amon of being a con artist who scammed investors floats like the Sword of Damocles above everything. On the run from the law and from bounty hunters, Amon also goes underground and hides out in their parentâ€™s former holiday home. During the sudden reunion of the two brothers, the past and present collide and an atmosphere of suspicion, mistrust and betrayal arises.","popularity":0.8196,"poster_path":"/zvrdkff6m3ek3RuvWrC81jxfbqe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man with the Camera","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Prisor","original_name":"Lucas Prisor","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/nqkXOWi60SWBqrxTZR4liSRrRZj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nathan","credit_id":"5ae60d45c3a3681370000a0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Burlakov","original_name":"Vladimir Burlakov","popularity":0.2937,"profile_path":"/zIpN4PwIDQSNgUvR2D3cNXYn0Ae.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Amon","credit_id":"5ae60d87c3a368134c001801","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2478608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katia Fellin","original_name":"Katia Fellin","popularity":0.1705,"profile_path":"/43kHrjr3qKFIDHOQWChhCewixuD.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"606d913dad59b5002abcfb9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Savage","original_name":"John Savage","popularity":1.0025,"profile_path":"/exzL5D7RSnIepF9FsFlzCs248he.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Epifano","credit_id":"5ae60d569251410d10000cb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaymes Butler","original_name":"Jaymes Butler","popularity":0.3151,"profile_path":"/i22INNLIiq0h3W26UwdcLed1O4N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bounty Hunter","credit_id":"5ae60d780e0a2610660010fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Preuss","original_name":"Uwe Preuss","popularity":0.5001,"profile_path":"/9CrAt3DSEHps4PP7LiHWah9yGMF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wolfgang Behn","credit_id":"5ae60d939251410d44000e2e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2032158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabeah Rahimi","original_name":"Rabeah Rahimi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"5ae60da39251410d20000d98","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1502486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Maria Reichert","original_name":"Eva-Maria Reichert","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/5s2MoMII55BAAv3Hv2UQclMzIPU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Zoe","credit_id":"5ae60dd5c3a368134300119a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1838586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Matschke","original_name":"Jochen Matschke","popularity":0.1968,"profile_path":"/2VaHEZXiCK2UBHeZLLYtRYrjoFV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mikail Rogov","credit_id":"5ae60dfe0e0a2610700010a6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1547021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Eichholz","original_name":"Vanessa Eichholz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/dyd7amkY0xVgjOosMLWgOXT0Kua.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"606d915de04aca0058db6c54","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sascha Maaz","original_name":"Sascha Maaz","popularity":0.1405,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"606d91650d2f53002935d2ed","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1779563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beniamino Brogi","original_name":"Beniamino Brogi","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/cafPiOS3JEZSX8hR0bJLJbbMYn2.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"606d916cad59b5002abcfba1","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Preuss","original_name":"Uwe Preuss","popularity":0.5001,"profile_path":"/9CrAt3DSEHps4PP7LiHWah9yGMF.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"606d92fd9ca759006e5c2a00","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"B.K.
