Here, though, the studio is not simply the location of the artwork’s genesis; the artist uses the artwork itself to dissect the space—and ultimately destroy the site—of its own production. In the video, Larson uses a turntable apparatus to inscribe circles onto paper, eventually perforating it. He continues the action until he breaks through the floor, creating a disorienting passage into unexpected new spaces.  — Whitney Museum 2014","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Rotation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Larson","original_name":"Chris Larson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae9c664c3a3683b9d0061bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
