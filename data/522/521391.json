Vernon, a pathological liar, is her only employee. However, instead of working, Vernon spends his time following Katherine around the shop, far more interested in talking about Cliffs Notes than he is in doing anything useful. Somehow, Vernon can't seem get Katherine's attention, until his fictional 'Juliet' is replaced by a real female cab driver. Initially fascinated with the red streaks in her dark hair, Vernon uses 'Juliet' in an attempt to impress Katherine. Instead, Vernon's pursuit of 'Juliet' threatens Katherine, which only serves to drive Vernon closer to 'Juliet.'","popularity":0.2781,"poster_path":"/ff0dAoT4HAQ1kMPWJDC89VLt3ES.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103962,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malamute Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Redheads are okay, but sometimes a little variety is good for the soul, don't you think?","title":"The Distinct Smell of Red","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guilford Adams","original_name":"Guilford Adams","popularity":0.26,"profile_path":"/28g6Ed2OUjQUdi6KKKJxD1cgwm8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Vernon","credit_id":"5ae6a36e9251410d100051ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Christian-McNair","original_name":"Robin Christian-McNair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Katherine","credit_id":"5ae6a3800e0a26106000681a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":205213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edi Patterson","original_name":"Edi Patterson","popularity":0.6131,"profile_path":"/ecVF2n0OrZcbDlPEkNnrAUyWQuH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Juliet","credit_id":"5ae6a3b2c3a3681367005733","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Kittelberger","original_name":"Jason Kittelberger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae6a3cc0e0a26105a006b6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Kittelberger","original_name":"Jason Kittelberger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae6a3d69251410d09006b58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032710,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Donna Strader","original_name":"Donna Strader","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae6a3df0e0a26104c00666e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0165713","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ff0dAoT4HAQ1kMPWJDC89VLt3ES.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
