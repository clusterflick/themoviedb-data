In dire need of money to finance a friend's operation, Mascotte auctions herself off at an artist's ball. She is \"bought\" by a novelist named Jean (Igo Sym), who merely wants to teach his flirtatious wife a lesson. Discreetly keeping his distance, Jean persuades Mascotte to pose as his mistress so that his wife will become jealous and return to his arms. Of course, things don't go as planned.","popularity":0.3069,"poster_path":"/is7l17e2FjnNoSvCLq5M1TjjhGw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1929-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adieu Mascotte","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Modell vom Montparnasse","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Harvey","original_name":"Lilian Harvey","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/hkEO3LYFOgu7tGVQLzc5ZpbV0w1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mascotte","credit_id":"5ae7b524c3a3681348013a4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igo Sym","original_name":"Igo Sym","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/xKiyW2xr0k6DnC8y3fiIDkliYs3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Dardier","credit_id":"5ae7b53ac3a36813550184b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marietta Millner","original_name":"Marietta Millner","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/j7FTxctDnmyAjTpP2WATRJrUIEa.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"His wife","credit_id":"67312f71060e42935fb65e89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Halm","original_name":"Harry Halm","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gaston","credit_id":"5ae7b5459251410ce4011fb9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Falkenstein","original_name":"Julius Falkenstein","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/h0TNT6fcmHKnkbnJ4W0VAw2zXpB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Giron","credit_id":"5ae7b54fc3a368134c0187b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Pröckl","original_name":"Ernst Pröckl","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Diener","credit_id":"5ae7b557c3a36813550184c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae7b5600e0a26105a011713","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","original_name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/8APjW4PoDWOX3EmP0JHBsB06dpJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Schaffner","credit_id":"5ae7b56a0e0a261070010f89","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Paulig","original_name":"Albert Paulig","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/sNva8ys3uhO4MpquNk4DnWitnfm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae7b5739251417baa00c284","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilhelm Thiele","original_name":"Wilhelm Thiele","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/uHiyOPYENpPJet44eVwpYkiP5Ip.jpg","credit_id":"5ae7b5179251410d4400d7f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Linsky","original_name":"Michel Linsky","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d58db49d71fb4001325953f","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13885,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Franz Schulz","original_name":"Franz Schulz","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d58db52d71fb40012259552","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320299,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolai Toporkoff","original_name":"Nikolai Toporkoff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/7Mr5HN5qNAHk7pdAzcMquY78TJd.jpg","credit_id":"5d58db64d71fb40015259563","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0019623","wikidata_id":"Q21035724","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/is7l17e2FjnNoSvCLq5M1TjjhGw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
