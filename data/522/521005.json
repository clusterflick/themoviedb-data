In the early 1990s the skate scene was bankrupt after a government economic plan that broke the industry. Motivated by the love of skateboarding and a \"do it yourself\" attitude, some friends, teenagers at the time, got together and released a home video that would change their lives forever. The tape was called “Dirty Money”. The video was an instant success, traveled the country, and inspired thousands who shared the same dream, becoming the cornerstone for the reconstruction of skateboarding as a sport and lifestyle in Brazil.","popularity":0.1066,"poster_path":"/qfCCim0CoxwAwlIbXIPEc3k90te.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Preasures","origin_country":""},{"id":103866,"logo_path":null,"name":"CEMPORCENTOSKATE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirty Money","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Dirty Money - Uma geração que transformou o skate no Brasil","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Dirty Money - A geração do Skate","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":200021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Burnquist","original_name":"Bob Burnquist","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/pRXtMu5RyQHxl5ei9orY1dhTCwb.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae39a44c3a3684903004522","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Márcio Tarobinha","original_name":"Márcio Tarobinha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae39a6292514149d300327a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fábio Cristiano","original_name":"Fábio Cristiano","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae39a6a92514149e2004bba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Vianna","original_name":"Alexandre Vianna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae39a730e0a2649d90052cf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Koraicho","original_name":"Ricardo Koraicho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae39b78c3a3684900005615","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Vianna","original_name":"Alexandre Vianna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae39b640e0a2649f4004dcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031030,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcelo Veloso","original_name":"Marcelo Veloso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae39f6fc3a36848f1007620","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q10266869","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qfCCim0CoxwAwlIbXIPEc3k90te.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1228}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":390,"name":"skateboarding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
