The film follows Butler's impassioned efforts to nurture troubled youth and keep them in school, fighting racial discrimination, but when his own teenage son is arrested and beaten in jail, he begins to question his methods and abilityâ€”not just as a teacher, but also as a father. With incredible access, Circles is an inspirational portrait of a father desperate to provide his son with the leadership and compassion he never received from his own.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vUYu3j5arfNa9rz6NeaJjV0BG6Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2032526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Butler","original_name":"Eric Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Eric","credit_id":"5ae665c7c3a36813510060bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tre Thomas","original_name":"Tre Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tre","credit_id":"5ae666369251410cd5003b2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercedes Morgan","original_name":"Mercedes Morgan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mercedes","credit_id":"5ae666510e0a26106600471d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betsye Steele","original_name":"Betsye Steele","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Betsye","credit_id":"5ae666729251410cd900480e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Quant","original_name":"Ted Quant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ted","credit_id":"5ae6667cc3a368134e006c56","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cassidy Friedman","original_name":"Cassidy Friedman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae66693c3a3681345003c31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cassidy Friedman","original_name":"Cassidy Friedman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae666a19251410cd5003b59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vUYu3j5arfNa9rz6NeaJjV0BG6Y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ogf1Xd3GrKCCVJj00FBLxquApHR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
