Alexander the Great has always enjoyed a unique status in history. To the Greeks and Romans, he was a hero, to the Arabs, he was a prophet, to Westerners, he is a myth.\r Alexander the Great Hellenized the ancient world and spread Greek civilisation single-handedly throughout, as far as the borders of India, by relentlessly pursuing his sworn enemy Darius the Great, King of Persia.\r But what remains today of the \"real\" Alexander? Of his life and environment? Through the many depictions of the hero and the archaeological traces of his triumphant conquest, this film portrays the legendary figure, who has always been, and continues to be, a great source of inspiration, even for artists of today.","popularity":0.2268,"poster_path":"/jXT4xgw0AFuR600OU18NdQsyBRL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":309,"logo_path":"/eVdJe4ha50lW1Eop1tq93TMh1XW.png","name":"Angoa-Agicoa","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":58641,"logo_path":"/wE7gFEpY5aTc0TtLdjYIopiSImh.png","name":"Les
