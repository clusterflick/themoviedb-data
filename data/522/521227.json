On the first day of filming, a teachers’ strike begins, paralyzing classes in the whole province, and – indirectly – the film itself. Donoso consequently embarks on an odyssey (which is sometimes funny and sometimes sad), through the past and present of his homeland. Stikes, claims, Sarmiento, the earthquake, the province’s bureocracy and its relationship with Buenos Aires, and finally, the desert, await for Donoso in his venturesome journey.","popularity":0.1928,"poster_path":"/aYYuDv5mutx6agQubkkTwFVYSxC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20124,"logo_path":"/uyKNacxTuJItGNZoqMzPtKtZBLn.png","name":"El Pampero Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2005-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opus","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Donoso","original_name":"Mariano Donoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae57c8dc3a368054e002b89","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Donoso","original_name":"Mariano Donoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae57b51c3a368092d000f85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Llinás","original_name":"Mariano Llinás","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/dfCOcnGqMXzr8BdaHHQ9ohdGfvN.jpg","credit_id":"5ae57bbf0e0a260377001e78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Masllorens","original_name":"Ignacio Masllorens","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/p6ME16mqPTyC77E1Bdi2iawWOGc.jpg","credit_id":"5ae57bf50e0a2602e30020ed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Donoso","original_name":"Mariano Donoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae57c440e0a2631aa003ffc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Donoso","original_name":"Mariano Donoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae57c5f925141309d003bd3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1706305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agustín Mendilaharzu","original_name":"Agustín Mendilaharzu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6c722f0e0a267ef813c0bb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1706305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agustín Mendilaharzu","original_name":"Agustín Mendilaharzu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9efc01e63571001df90087","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Donoso","original_name":"Mariano Donoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9efc1024f2ce002230ab49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Llinás","original_name":"Mariano Llinás","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/dfCOcnGqMXzr8BdaHHQ9ohdGfvN.jpg","credit_id":"5e9efc21c92c5d0021b7b862","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587464,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Chwojnik","original_name":"Gabriel Chwojnik","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qr3H8IHD78zjroizTiveDc9w7hT.jpg","credit_id":"5e9efc3ce635710024f90319","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0304877","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hPpfsEUn8g4PpdyYvLiTSlOwtS0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aYYuDv5mutx6agQubkkTwFVYSxC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
