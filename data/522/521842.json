Rankin (not Rankins) shoots Tug, who is unaware of Rankin's lawless activities, in an argument and Jim is accused of murder and also stampeding the sheep. Believing Jim is guilty, Tug's daughter, Ruth, aids Buck in capturing Jim, but he escapes. Ruth gets help from Sheriff Hank Bosley, and a sheepherder, Sanchez, reveals Rankin's responsibility for both the rustling of Bledsoe's cattle and the killing of Wilson.","popularity":0.5448,"poster_path":"/m3VcH9Lp2RGuK2Lx25mPFrcOqw1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Latest of Bob's Wows!","title":"Near the Rainbow's End","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Steele","original_name":"Bob Steele","popularity":0.3453,"profile_path":"/jOaQFxwyNWRNEEdRoiiRaOVrOpK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jim Bledsoe","credit_id":"5ae91e73c3a3683b9d00133d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Bledsoe","credit_id":"5ae91e81c3a3683bb5001c2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Ferguson","original_name":"Al Ferguson","popularity":0.1887,"profile_path":"/pqsu8OuPrGPMwuvvPsL1cVMzEMr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Buck Rankin","credit_id":"5ae91e9b92514124720016ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Hewston","original_name":"Alfred Hewston","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tug Wilson","credit_id":"5ae91eb2c3a3683baf001869","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1027912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Lorraine","original_name":"Louise Lorraine","popularity":0.1295,"profile_path":"/4cALckPqW0MKFOSc6VuUtWawmun.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ruth Wilson","credit_id":"5ae91ec2c3a3683bb2002769","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Bell","original_name":"Hank Bell","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/kJrAa6i3IK9I3AyNUOCRzuLh13P.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sheriff Hank","credit_id":"5ae91ed6925141242c0019f3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Comstock","original_name":"Clark Comstock","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Man with Pipe","credit_id":"5ae91ee3c3a3683bb5001c5b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Corey","original_name":"Jim Corey","popularity":0.1461,"profile_path":"/seiP80s9TYehniM1qiTQUZywxWR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henchman","credit_id":"5ae91ef6c3a3683baf00189d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Luther","original_name":"Johnny Luther","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Cowhand Singer","credit_id":"5ae91f049251412483001a2d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Lyons","original_name":"Cliff Lyons","popularity":0.3328,"profile_path":"/pIY0P7eeSGtPcsdRM4YAqT4VEvj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lefty - Henchman","credit_id":"5ae91f180e0a263960001af1","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merrill McCormick","original_name":"Merrill McCormick","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Frenchy Sanchez - the Shepherd","credit_id":"5ae91f29c3a3683bac00224c","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Perry Murdock","original_name":"Perry Murdock","popularity":0.1856,"profile_path":"/6neMtPnKPrcNhEPqwewsOaxHzNn.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Perry - Cowhand","credit_id":"5ae91f3a925141243d001e42","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tex Palmer","original_name":"Tex Palmer","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Cowhand","credit_id":"5ae91f5e925141247e00148f","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1356880,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sally Winters","original_name":"Sally Winters","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae91f7b0e0a26395d001cf2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305053,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trem Carr","original_name":"Trem Carr","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae91f92c3a3683bb2002850","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118218,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"E.R.
