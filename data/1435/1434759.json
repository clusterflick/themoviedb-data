Roped together at the waist using a few flat knots and little equipment, the two twin brothers achieved more than 200 firsts across the entire massif. A unique style and commitment, a state of mind made up of adventure, literature, inventiveness and friendship. Unclassifiable and outgoing, after 60 years of Pyrenees, their desire for the mountains is intact. When does a race start? How does the idea, the desire, come about? What sense does it make to only achieve firsts? And what is the role of the Pyrenees themselves in this reciprocal and endless game of attraction?","popularity":0.2765,"poster_path":"/4a8d3Zk7c027FBFvwNATU9Cib26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1117,"logo_path":"/2X2uFeObxawiAajNDOf3Mhri5Wg.png","name":"Antenne
