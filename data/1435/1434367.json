He is rattled by frantic calls from his office, continued nags from his wife to do the weekend tasks, chaotic loudspeaker announcements from the lane besides, agitated pressure-cooker whistle as if it’s going to burst anytime – and amid all this catastrophe his phone hangs! This is when the iconic Bhooter Raja, appears in his hung-mobile through an app & gives him a boon, a boon where he will be in slumber for a day – nothing in the world can affect him while he taking rest (rather Lyaad) for 24 hours. The musical starts from here and captures a day where he is enjoying his Lyaad moments, completely unaffected by the chaos around.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/uOOELRjo8wT1i5g2eECZkE8AW1n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lyaad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ritwick Chakraborty","original_name":"Ritwick Chakraborty","popularity":0.3324,"profile_path":"/5UQBHY7BSYqfhuUtulX7fAwAc3G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67afac2e8f46d2b9f305306a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/fiBtIrt7b6mxbcTesFGiAlV2xOp.jpg","credit_id":"67afacab8f46d2b9f305307e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/fiBtIrt7b6mxbcTesFGiAlV2xOp.jpg","credit_id":"67afacb906e4016cb94a483a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12429312","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"bn","file_path":"/uOOELRjo8wT1i5g2eECZkE8AW1n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2020-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
