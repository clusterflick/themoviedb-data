Guided by memories of the mountain paths his mother Liu Xia once led him through, he began searching for their reindeer herd. At the same time, he brought elements of urban culture—skateboards, mountain bikes, short videos, and rap—into the forest. This unique blend represents the style of the new generation of reindeer herders, who maintain a connection with the world beyond the forest. They cherish the traditions of the hunting era but are not confined by them.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"柳霞的太阳","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"The Sun, in Liu Xia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gu Tao","original_name":"Gu Tao","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pKY0W3DUvR1Z7vFWNBZyhw1YKzF.jpg","credit_id":"67b2a10641ea6104626dc040","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
