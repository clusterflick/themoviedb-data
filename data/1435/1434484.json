A group of filmmakers gathers for what they believe to be a routine crew call - an invitation to collaborate on their next big project. Instead, they walk into a sinister trap where their darkest secrets are exposed, and their worst fears come to life. Each attendee has a hidden past intertwined with the abuse of a rising actress named Courtney Monroe, who sought fame but found herself betrayed and discarded. Some were direct perpetrators, while others remained silent bystanders. Now, a mysterious game master seeks to make them confront their guilt - in a game where losing means death.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ojClREgjKAXkr1NCk1ZHUnJsl9H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ashley Brantley Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everyone gets what they deserve.","title":"Crew Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ojClREgjKAXkr1NCk1ZHUnJsl9H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
