The film captures the inner dialogue and meditations of an extraordinary artist in the moments of creation. Heyden works for over a year to create works inspired by the Eno River in Durham, North Carolina. And she shares how nature, music, her Bauhaus inspired education at the School of the Arts in Zurich and her life experiences anchor and inform her art. Heyden was a 20th century modernist whose body of work redefines the art of modern tapestry.","popularity":0.2621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146702,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Groove Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Weaverly Path: The Tapestry Life of Silvia Heyden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5247301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Heyden","original_name":"Silvia Heyden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67af9040f68e724f201cd397","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenny Dalsheimer","original_name":"Kenny Dalsheimer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af901088917a03f38e7569","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5247300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marybeth Dugan","original_name":"Marybeth Dugan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af90272506e5fd303b692e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1747914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":214409,"name":"weaving"},{"id":294168,"name":"textile craft"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
