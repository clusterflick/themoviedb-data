Raphaëlle, struggling with maladaptive daydreaming, escapes into highly immersive fantasies, torn between joy and suffering. This refuge keeps her from facing reality, including her homosexuality. Over time, she learns to break free from it, embrace her identity, and write. Through discussions with specialists and a writing workshop, the three young women share their perspectives on dreams and existence in an intimate and existential journey.","popularity":0.0527,"poster_path":"/wO9EREBl6OAMsAkM9nvYVOpd4Ey.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97782,"logo_path":"/xPgTSHpGRJR2JCyMDvlE7XehTRw.png","name":"Talweg Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5357044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elona","original_name":"Elona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elona","credit_id":"67f4eb518cfccf7bafd959ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5357046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphaëlle","original_name":"Raphaëlle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Raphaëlle","credit_id":"67f4eb5e7b43bdce20ad76d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5357047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte","original_name":"Charlotte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"67f4eb668cfccf7bafd959c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Calvo","original_name":"Sabrina Calvo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sabrina Calvo","credit_id":"67f4ebd31bb0472899999b22","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne Mayer","original_name":"Jeanne Mayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af0868f68e724f201cbade","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3064426,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Meigniez","original_name":"Julie Meigniez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67afb99b1f3841ee176c3331","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne Mayer","original_name":"Jeanne Mayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2a5aeede8d82f3badac06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g6xeWSRe9fmrhxO34ZjciS96bmw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n4osI98KR2ZIBV7oYjzHOSaSwYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1699,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wO9EREBl6OAMsAkM9nvYVOpd4Ey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
