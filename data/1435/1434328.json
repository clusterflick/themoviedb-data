Fearing the fires of war, waves of people seek refuge from all over Europe to Paris, the only remaining city of light. But no one can guess how much longer that light will last.  Ravic, a surgeon, is a refugee from Germany making a living in Paris as an unlicensed doctor. On a cold rainy night, Ravic meets a woman who is standing off in a daze, apparently about to jump off Alma Bridge into the River Seine. He rescues her just in time, and inquires about her background although he isn't very interested.","popularity":0.1431,"poster_path":"/tWI2n6nUTRjBsnW9VGGVjj9VCZG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arch of Triumph -From the Novel by Erich Maria Remarque-","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu Todoroki","original_name":"Yu Todoroki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67af9ef4b76419ebfc1cc820","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2706186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuuto Nozomi","original_name":"望海風斗","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/zQEz5vazTRtpaF5zE7OIjIWR75R.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boris Morosow","credit_id":"67af9f04e7908d6cc48e8486","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maaya Kiho","original_name":"真彩希帆","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/jAMwxE4UWeTQphaSv4nHu3V4Hay.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joan Madou","credit_id":"67af9f142506e5fd303b6b60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3228754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakina Ayakaze","original_name":"彩風咲奈","popularity":0.1657,"profile_path":"/6WbzQjkIQLEpwXJVoSKwEZhZgFY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Henri Jardin","credit_id":"67af9f1dfc6e82f86e8e7290","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Asami","original_name":"朝美絢","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":"/u7ip8C8Z2vnneG0WwyTw7Zue8xG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jaime Alvarez","credit_id":"67ef73b3f5a80aa545993017","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sea Towaki","original_name":"永久輝せあ","popularity":0.1435,"profile_path":"/oBZXs6LfnAljlxynkeKnjh8oGH4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rosenfeld","credit_id":"67ef73bff5a80aa545993021","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sen Agata","original_name":"縣千","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/91WJiuhLEhf7JPbITFYzCfS7Zcs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Wiesenhoff","credit_id":"67ef73cfede8d82f3bad0374","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Hana","original_name":"潤花","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/yCPyOggYup74cSMSOHun4B3lCyr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Otto","credit_id":"67ef73d8ede8d82f3bad0378","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928438,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sha Tamae","original_name":"Sha Tamae","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ctZsfYie4Gwn5xaIIMouZhzb8pO.jpg","credit_id":"67ef7441b3e035286cd93a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928438,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sha Tamae","original_name":"Sha Tamae","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/ctZsfYie4Gwn5xaIIMouZhzb8pO.jpg","credit_id":"67ef7551a9313c7184ad0404","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3934208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shibata Yukihiro","original_name":"柴田侑宏","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ef755e8b1f32eb79d9187f","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/299OT9YbaDaJlrQawX6mj9pUDaS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tWI2n6nUTRjBsnW9VGGVjj9VCZG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
