Now struggling to survive on the fringes of society, their lives teeter between a primitive existence in nature and post-apocalyptic science-fiction. Because of their extreme condition, their way of life has never been photographed — until now. Zone Blanche is a film without electricity.","popularity":0.0833,"poster_path":"/oS42ZhjG00csCugc6ByHOKcaub0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Cautin","original_name":"Anne Cautin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67af05b66d1a7b60523b5f3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annick Poinas","original_name":"Annick Poinas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67af05be6d1a7b60523b5f47","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie Reiff","original_name":"Anne-Marie Reiff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67af05c6a18ebf2ac58e5f23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Touloumond","original_name":"Bernadette Touloumond","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67af05cd6d1a7b60523b5f53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ève Couturier","original_name":"Ève Couturier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"67af05dda18ebf2ac58e5f39","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5246424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaëlle Cintré","original_name":"Gaëlle Cintré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af055b6d1a7b60523b5f1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1806793,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Augustin Barbaroux","original_name":"Augustin Barbaroux","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af056a6d1a7b60523b5f28","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576396,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Bailly","original_name":"François Bailly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af0579e7908d6cc48e6616","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876234,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clément Laforce","original_name":"Clément Laforce","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af0587f12cec6e301cb705","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246426,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Beggars Opera","original_name":"Beggars Opera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af0595104612e8633b5c8a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5246424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaëlle Cintré","original_name":"Gaëlle Cintré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af05f6f12cec6e301cb753","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4529178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1606,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oS42ZhjG00csCugc6ByHOKcaub0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1072}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":346362,"name":"electromagnetic hypersensitivity (ehs)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
