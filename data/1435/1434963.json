An artist gets the commission to create an artwork to mark the city jubilee. With “participation” as method, a group of citizens of Oslo joins the project. They are asked to develop and present their own art proposals under the guiding principles “trust, creativity and joyful collaboration”. Together the group will come to a joint conclusion of the best artwork for the city. The project develops into a tragicomic dystopia when the artist attempts to please the municipal bureaucracy as well as multifaceted public.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":253669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oslo Kommunes
