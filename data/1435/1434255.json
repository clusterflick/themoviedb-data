Estonian sculptors, former political prisoners, social scientists and art historians share their memories in the film. Why do we need our monuments? What kind of attitude has been towards Estonian monuments and heritage artwork during the changing times in local history? Memorial columns can be victims of ideology. Estonia has been governed by several state authorities during the 20th century, all of them have left their own monuments. The destiny of numerous military monuments in East-Europe has become a current issue.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/xczaH0ENdY0gJonUmgcoaZNMhuL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freyja Film","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2008-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monument","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337370,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tõnu Virve","original_name":"Tõnu Virve","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bjgsm17RYaXmFuLkYC0S9vhhp73.jpg","credit_id":"67af744db76419ebfc1cc2bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337370,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tõnu Virve","original_name":"Tõnu Virve","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bjgsm17RYaXmFuLkYC0S9vhhp73.jpg","credit_id":"67af745a2506e5fd303b6619","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5247144,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juta Kivimäe","original_name":"Juta Kivimäe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af74642506e5fd303b6622","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3950510,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rasmus Puksmann","original_name":"Rasmus Puksmann","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/hoq5Jdi4Izro3lp1soe0n4jvagn.jpg","credit_id":"67af7473f12cec6e301cccd5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305969,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mihkel Soe","original_name":"Mihkel Soe","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/3JikfPxoktc9Nk6tQxZyn16qdXV.jpg","credit_id":"67af747e9669ff44cc3b6fd0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5247145,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arthur Virve","original_name":"Arthur Virve","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af7488c6080c56368e7558","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395156,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sven Grünberg","original_name":"Sven Grünberg","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/w7XobunUliSEluyaWav4abMXd8a.jpg","credit_id":"67af7492a6f774127c1cc68b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3805171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mario Narbekov","original_name":"Mario Narbekov","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af74a0c46fb7c09e3b669b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3950510,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rasmus Puksmann","original_name":"Rasmus Puksmann","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/hoq5Jdi4Izro3lp1soe0n4jvagn.jpg","credit_id":"67af74aac6080c56368e7561","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337370,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tõnu Virve","original_name":"Tõnu Virve","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bjgsm17RYaXmFuLkYC0S9vhhp73.jpg","credit_id":"67af74c1c46fb7c09e3b66a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1872827","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2316,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/xczaH0ENdY0gJonUmgcoaZNMhuL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
