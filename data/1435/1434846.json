The Aiguille de la République, in the Mont-Blanc massif, culminates at an altitude of 3,305 meters among the Aiguilles de Chamonix group of summits. In the Fontainebleau forest, children learn mountaineering techniques on the bouldering climbing site. In 1954, rock climbing was also practiced in the Chamonix valley. The Montenvers train crosses the viaduct taking tourists or athletes to the Mer de Glace viewpoint. The two climbers take an approach step and reach the Envers des Aiguilles refuge. They then climb this steep and smooth wall, progressing along the ridge. On the platform, a rope throw allows them to climb up and sit at the top to dominate the panorama. Then the return: abseiling from the summit block.","popularity":0.1945,"poster_path":"/pWqN4CjqyaRxsk1KUFh8jz1gOO1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54184,"logo_path":"/ooOsSY5D4cD5zZs1vK14BD3TMmm.png","name":"Société Française de Cinématographie (SFC)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La République nous appelle","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Fromentin","original_name":"Jacques Fromentin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b10596af9b0caae135c492","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Bastien","original_name":"Michel Bastien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b1059fb5c58ae5ee3633a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Lara","original_name":"Jean Lara","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/gGSiHf6i9KVlU5nnwgY7bngMEgI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (Narrator)","credit_id":"67b105b2af9b0caae135c49c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2319025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Dassonville","original_name":"Hélène Dassonville","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/1h3RXUCcoPQjcGAs5oZ2HG5voLC.jpg","credit_id":"67b105c1c465103e0435c1f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1947362,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"René Vernadet","original_name":"René Vernadet","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/4p55mykNQh2YC0FUOag5uJd7c54.jpg","credit_id":"67b105cc4fddfd52e335bd65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38377,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Yatove","original_name":"Jean Yatove","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/hgTDl2KbdPTRSReVXUdkamztQik.jpg","credit_id":"67b105d870c8865ebd36390d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4924808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lXJiRGIt9Ko0VuGevI5Hr4ncTV6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWqN4CjqyaRxsk1KUFh8jz1gOO1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":346918,"name":"french alpinism"},{"id":347026,"name":"mont-blanc mountains range"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
