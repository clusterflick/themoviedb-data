Forced to choose between being raped by outlaws or giving in to Neil's sexual demands, Grace moves in with her fiancé. A year later, Grace rescues James Stapleton, a gold miner, from a desert death and helps him to escape from Neil's greedy clutches. Before Neil can punish her, she knocks him out and flees to New York, where she meets and then marries Oliver West, a jeweler with failing vision. To help with his medical bills, Grace sells a short story, but Neil shows up and threatens to expose her past unless she gives him her earnings. Eventually, Oliver finds out about Grace and Neil and goes blind from the shock. Determined to win Oliver back, Grace enlists the help of Stapleton, now a rich broker, to thwart Neil and secure a sight-restoring operation for Oliver. When Oliver hears Neil's confession of Grace's difficult past, he finally forgives her.","popularity":0.1821,"poster_path":"/xbX97qqVjdh9X8G8oHjefTLUO5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shall We Forgive Her?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Elvidge","original_name":"June Elvidge","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fbcSD4gt790qR0CBpsqqL4EkqfP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grace Raymond","credit_id":"67af19b7c46fb7c09e3b5cf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Ashley","original_name":"Arthur Ashley","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/bvdYXp0uMcvYL2LrXclVXSuhhyC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Neil Garth","credit_id":"67af19c09669ff44cc3b5daa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bowers","original_name":"John Bowers","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/j6KhoMBcaddOHhyuHjXIUxAyjzP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Oliver West","credit_id":"67af19c980f76d61eb8e6850","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Clary","original_name":"Charles Clary","popularity":0.2506,"profile_path":"/nAEqw3M130Wco0N1g0IVFWFvUE6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Uncle John","credit_id":"67af19d380f76d61eb8e6864","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1645326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Barrington","original_name":"Herbert Barrington","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/aurqfc6ddpV2jkwnlQEOZevAS1p.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paul Ellsworth","credit_id":"67af19dec46fb7c09e3b5cfc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Matthews","original_name":"Arthur Matthews","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/dL4Pvp4fdyxNtit2Jmhj4Hl5e4q.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dick","credit_id":"67af1a35e7908d6cc48e6995","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":952657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George MacQuarrie","original_name":"George MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/9eGUVUBTQLA6e3uT0YmZQ72hPbT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"James Stapleton","credit_id":"67af1a2ba24bd8f7101cbfcc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandria Carewe","original_name":"Alexandria Carewe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Joan","credit_id":"67af19f2a24bd8f7101cbf99","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Collins","original_name":"Richard Collins","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"67af1a06c46fb7c09e3b5d10","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2563379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Johnston","original_name":"Katherine Johnston","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nellie West","credit_id":"67af1a20a24bd8f7101cbfbb","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Ashley","original_name":"Arthur Ashley","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/bvdYXp0uMcvYL2LrXclVXSuhhyC.jpg","credit_id":"67af1a5df68e724f201cbdb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1320457,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Harvey","original_name":"Frank Harvey","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/vC6plQkst8zFh721EcHM5ORODG4.jpg","credit_id":"67af1a6cfc6e82f86e8e5fe1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346916,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Sarver","original_name":"Charles Sarver","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af1a78c46fb7c09e3b5d2c","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0182417","wikidata_id":"Q53844848","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1597,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xbX97qqVjdh9X8G8oHjefTLUO5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1065}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
