This activity has become a sacred ritual for him. Yet deep inside, he awaits and seeks some sort of solution to his solitude. One day during a particularly severe drought, the Earth answers him - the man finds the unconscious body of a woman in the soil cracked by the heat. Without stopping to think, he takes her home, resuscitates her and looks after her. This unexpected companion seriously test his convictions. How far can solitude go? A story about the destructive vicious circle of solitude - the fixed idea, love and giving up love.","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":"/zUGibURA6UtGrEOPAIX9kyf84TN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6163,"logo_path":"/AlWeXHCWoJMx4HoZiOJ4GNjJ6qz.png","name":"Exitfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2001-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
