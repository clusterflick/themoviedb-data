He is sensitive, melancholy and a dreamer. He is unable to communicate his feelings to the woman he loves. Everything seems to have been entangled in a mesh, irrespective of these characters. He cannot even differentiate between his capability to love and his passionate desires which have been repressed. That is how he is confused and with his ideals and morality he is living outside his own time and inevitably suffering. His self criticism is endless. He dreams about whatever he lacks and about his ideals. The dreams have led him to the domain of non-communication. His repressed passion along with his self criticism has made him bored with life. Now at every point he expects something exceptional.","popularity":0.1541,"poster_path":"/eMlkAqWjVI7ABGxNX4osHO2Tpzg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reconnaissance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irrfan Khan","original_name":"Irrfan Khan","popularity":1.584,"profile_path":"/qkA9PpWJRw3rNjVkWfNZdwLvRZx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67af8f00104612e8633b775a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1147135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Kanwar","original_name":"Anita Kanwar","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67b31bce6113c493dc6dcc6d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandeep Chatterjee","original_name":"Sandeep Chatterjee","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af8f1b104612e8633b7765","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eMlkAqWjVI7ABGxNX4osHO2Tpzg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bsJyPdTZC8ij23ldYkKd1uXIKfv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJQKeH5ymY0pkERnMtIyUbI0rt3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":337121,"name":"ftii diploma film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
