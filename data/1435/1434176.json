Known for his use of common material, Bochner's elements are easily understandable yet his art is founded on the unexpected questioning of how simple things hold the ability to reveal eye-opening complexities. A relationship established through language, Bochner's work takes the form of a dialogue between practice and theory, defining his subject as \"the contradiction between physical space and mental space.\" Bochner uses that contradiction to create visual think pieces, locating his own intention- and thus emotion- through his process, his sites, and the mind of his viewer.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":"/uRhjil6PFlwoJHVVxxbBVt3WRQv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mel Bochner: Thoughts Made Visible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Bochner","original_name":"Mel Bochner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67af40f0e7908d6cc48e6ef8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"67af40e19669ff44cc3b65ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11568826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uRhjil6PFlwoJHVVxxbBVt3WRQv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
