After embarrassing himself in front of the girl of his dreams, he sets out to change his image and become popular. However, upon taking a potion from a local gypsy, he is turned into a super cool hipster that cannot be stopped. Able to out-cool and out-handshake anyone, he begins sleeping with women who are younger and younger at an alarming rate. Time is of the essence as Rudolph's soul seems to dwindle in light of his new found coolness. Now his two best friends will try to stop him in the name of their home town, but will they be enough to save every woman's fortitude in time?","popularity":0.1255,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":253610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Not A Tad Bad Flim Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far would you go... to be cool?","title":"Hip Hop, Cherry Pop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4722407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Botsch","original_name":"Joseph Botsch","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rudolph","credit_id":"67af2fe5e7908d6cc48e6d46","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin J.
