Hand-processed in salty seawater, its 16mm images dissolve and transform. The landscape flashes by in broken frames of light and shadow, as if the world itself was stuttering between memory and motion. A meditation on seeing and being seen, the film lingers like a fading dream, where observer and landscape blur into one.","popularity":0.2474,"poster_path":"/ww8T7W2THqI5PEZonB3woKNk6MD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things many have eyes seen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2755031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannick Mosimann","original_name":"Yannick Mosimann","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/zdvNJoIBHFAVqM76iq8AruG4ZP5.jpg","credit_id":"67afb1da14263d4fe76c324d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rMuYVVjb0277AElQ94inolejksu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ww8T7W2THqI5PEZonB3woKNk6MD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3307,"name":"surreal"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
