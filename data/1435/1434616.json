It looks organic and could perhaps be part of a small insect. The hand enters again and replaces the object with another which seems to be the same kind of thing but which is also unrecognizable. This is repeated and each time the new object is placed in exactly the same place and each time it is slightly bigger than the one before. By the end of the film, the object is relatively large, but tantalizingly unrecognizable.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":"/uNJfGRg8giqbl8zm4HjVqRCfuS7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comparative Anatomy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2619121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Feingold","original_name":"Ken Feingold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b07df4ac088a41456c4219","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uNJfGRg8giqbl8zm4HjVqRCfuS7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
