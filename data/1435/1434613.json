However, his designated successor, Ramavolahy, and his Merina clan, plan to conquer the other kingdoms by force to establish a Great Merina Kingdom. Andrianampoinimerina must convince Ramavolahy to support his dream, or else find another heir. After a mystical revelation, he decides to replace Ramavolahy with Ikoto, the son of his wife from Ambohitratrimo, a Sakalava Princess. The film is a historical drama mixing palace intrigues, conspiracies, and betrayals, highlighting the visionary wisdom of the Great King, who paved the way for the Genesis of the Malagasy Nation thanks to Radama, recognized as King of Madagascar by royalty and the International Community.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2NN0E6LcpppjIFoAAYzeOy48IOm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valamparihy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MG","name":"Madagascar"}],"release_date":"2023-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nampoina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valo­ni­aina Ranaivoson","original_name":"Valo­ni­aina Ranaivoson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Andrianampoini­me­rina","credit_id":"67b07b7c70c8865ebd36208d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andry Andrianierenana","original_name":"Andry Andrianierenana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67b07e53b5c58ae5ee362706","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikolo Mikajy Kirombo","original_name":"Mikolo Mikajy Kirombo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67b07e62b5c58ae5ee362716","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaona Harivelo Nicolas","original_name":"Jaona Harivelo Nicolas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67b07e6dac088a41456c4257","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raymond Ranjeva","original_name":"Raymond Ranjeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b07b2e70c8865ebd362071","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Randrianierenana","original_name":"Henri Randrianierenana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b07b4370c8865ebd36207f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haingotiana Rasolondraibe","original_name":"Haingotiana Rasolondraibe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b07b51b1bd2f6e9f35a9fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31174272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Fiz3T2CmM993WYdfwYOahhZfcw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"mg","file_path":"/2NN0E6LcpppjIFoAAYzeOy48IOm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mg","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mg","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BANDE ANNONCE - FILM NAMPOINA","key":"9xtyiF5JWP8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-10T07:32:12.000Z","id":"67b07dc8ac088a41456c41fb"}]}}}
