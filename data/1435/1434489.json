A black and white film work from an imaginary state of the same name, in which a lone rider crosses an empty landscape in a meditation on identity and belonging. The Bedouin term ‘Illiyeen’ refers to a heavenly record or register where the deeds of the righteous are written down and protected. But here, Illiyeen is transformed into an allegorical ‘state of nowhere and nation of everywhere’ beyond geographical or national borders.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/wSKzyXbgWBwWzpiUgJsyBektjyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2025-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Illiyeen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliyah Mesayer","original_name":"Eliyah Mesayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff61f47dbfba4646c3ee0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3471063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nanna Rebekka","original_name":"Nanna Rebekka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff628acb9fcdc0a35a3c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248030,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebekka Laugesen","original_name":"Rebekka Laugesen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff631acb9fcdc0a35a3cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4092192,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philip Peng Rosenthal","original_name":"Philip Peng Rosenthal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff70547dbfba4646c3efe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199628,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joakim Wei Bernild","original_name":"Joakim Wei Bernild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff713af9b0caae135a1a9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199628,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joakim Wei Bernild","original_name":"Joakim Wei Bernild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff718f2e084af7f361691","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3471063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nanna Rebekka","original_name":"Nanna Rebekka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aff72547dbfba4646c3f03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSKzyXbgWBwWzpiUgJsyBektjyl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"CPH:DOX 2025","release_date":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
