Eighth entry into deeply beguiling series of works responding to the Alps acted as the closing night event of Alchemy Film Festival. The images are studies of the Alps degraded and distorted live at the front of the auditorium; the picture pixelated, streams of colour engulfed the screen like a crashed desktop, and as hawks hovered over the mountains they left staggered trails of glitches across the screen like computerised vapour trails. The audio was also created live using short atonal precomposed tracks. The aim was to create a digital alchemy, an abstracted journey into the mountains, a wild wonder inside and out.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE EIGHTH ALPS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Perconte","original_name":"Jacques Perconte","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/oFRS8RjhboOOKhQK8j4sVWF25lS.jpg","credit_id":"67b1365b169e365af69f97c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
