Born in an artist's village, the author evokes the life of the troupe founded by her father Ramilison (known as Dadamily, Basigara) and more than six centuries of history of her country. The film is also haunted by death: many of the people filmed died of illness or road accidents, because in Madagascar, the health system is in ruins, the bush taxis are rolling coffins, and the drivers, who most often have bought their license, know neither the code nor safe driving. Why so many deaths? In this country, if you are not rich, and you are injured or sick, you die. A rebellious film that invites us to change things profoundly in the largest island in the Indian Ocean.","popularity":0.0568,"poster_path":"/6SwzSxXHGt4i5icuQhI5o4HWc1K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24731,"logo_path":"/vwQj2DPMJWBlgKC2Ek6h4aOe5AQ.png","name":"Les Films Grain de Sable","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MG","name":"Madagascar"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Opéra Hira Gasy de Madagascar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emeline Raholiarisoa","original_name":"Emeline Raholiarisoa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67b0564ea524dd1d0a35a95e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emeline Raholiarisoa","original_name":"Emeline Raholiarisoa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b051de47dbfba4646c4b11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emeline Raholiarisoa","original_name":"Emeline Raholiarisoa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b051ebe5a6eebadf36210d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Pfohl","original_name":"Frédéric Pfohl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b05209ddbc64cc91361dc6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Mauro","original_name":"Didier Mauro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0521fddbc64cc91361dce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5248320,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tarika Ramilison Fenoarico","original_name":"Tarika Ramilison Fenoarico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0524947dbfba4646c4b3d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6SwzSxXHGt4i5icuQhI5o4HWc1K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L'OPERA HIRA GASY DE MADAGASCAR BANDE ANNONCE","key":"EpEoNVCohTw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-23T14:01:33.000Z","id":"67b0554547dbfba4646c4be8"}]}}}
