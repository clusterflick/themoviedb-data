Their targets, a bizarre mix, included the Miss World contest, Fordâ€™s motor factory, the home of a conservative cabinet minister and the Biba department store. Following a two year hunt by the newly formed Special Branch, eight suspects were arrested, and following the longest trial in British criminal history, four young graduates were convicted of the bombings.  The Angry Years tells the little known story of the Angry Brigade - contributors include Jake Prescott, ex Angry Brigade member, the journalist Paul Foot and the Special Branch detective credited with tracking the Angry Brigade down.","popularity":0.5236,"poster_path":"/uflfccVb5f46yke05eM9RulBRr9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Granite Film and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angry Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Akhurst","original_name":"Lucy Akhurst","popularity":0.4079,"profile_path":"/o7NxnyYFZGV0K0wQhPTTv13yHeM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67af2eecf68e724f201cc221","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Prescott","original_name":"Jake Prescott","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67af301bf68e724f201cc2ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208915,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gordon Carr","original_name":"Gordon Carr","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself (Television Journalist)","credit_id":"67af3073f68e724f201cc33d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Foot","original_name":"Paul Foot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself (Journalist)","credit_id":"67af30a3c6080c56368e6d09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathon Green","original_name":"Jonathon Green","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself (Historian)","credit_id":"67af30f9f68e724f201cc3c1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacDonald","original_name":"Ian MacDonald","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself (Barrister)","credit_id":"67af3146c46fb7c09e3b5e08","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Creamer","original_name":"Roy Creamer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself (Ex-Special Branch)","credit_id":"67af31ed2506e5fd303b5985","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fran Robertson","original_name":"Fran Robertson","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af2ad6e7908d6cc48e6bd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044471,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Neve Cunningham","original_name":"Neve Cunningham","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af2af3e7908d6cc48e6bf6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246691,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Welfare","original_name":"Simon Welfare","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af2b0df7d37fc2db1cbe00","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fran Robertson","original_name":"Fran Robertson","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af2f44f68e724f201cc245","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5i1f5UVa03idA1ykscMaN4mXmSK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":830,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uflfccVb5f46yke05eM9RulBRr9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33702,"name":"bombing"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":227148,"name":"anarchism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'The Angry Years' documentary","key":"-698lksFk4U","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-09-08T09:12:15.000Z","id":"67af2cb5104612e8633b6204"}]}}}
