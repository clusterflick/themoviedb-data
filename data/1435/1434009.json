Nearby, an eyewitness to the nuclear tests writes down his personal memories, while his son struggles to save his sick daughter. Through the intimate story of three generations of one family, the film reflects on humanity's collective history and the dire situation facing our future. The steppe serves as a metaphor for our planet, now perilously close to becoming a vast nuclear wasteland.","popularity":0.0768,"poster_path":"/uXhG2CGyP2hIUXoD7Yh0sl5uXft.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2025-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Live Here","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhanana Kurmasheva","original_name":"Zhanana Kurmasheva","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aeb5f7f28d95adb3d0e450","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35301026","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXhG2CGyP2hIUXoD7Yh0sl5uXft.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
