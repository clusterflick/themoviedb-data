These collages of propaganda footage, cultural gatherings, and scenes of everyday life show moments of genuine unity. Yet, beneath this sense of belonging, other truths begin to surface and the film shifts from a broader documentary exploration of the country to a more intimate, personal narrative. The focus turns to the filmmaker’s investigation into her grandfather’s imprisonment and the silent trauma it has left behind. Fragmented memories create a complex picture of political repression in Yugoslavia. As the film progresses, the visuals slowly fade, symbolizing the lack of clarity and the gaps in understanding the full scope of what happened to those silenced under the regime.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There’s Fatamorgana In My Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5246743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eneja Golob Džananović","original_name":"Eneja Golob Džananović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67af32912506e5fd303b59c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
