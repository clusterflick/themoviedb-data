The film is a study of a territory, and the marks and wounds that it bears of a history of pillage, but also a portrait of the people that inhabit it (farmers, antique dealers, amateur archaeologists, local historians) and their symbiotic relationship to the landscape.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/fuf6QgZ4DPar85TqisEuofnjps9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Siticulosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1806929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maeve Brennan","original_name":"Maeve Brennan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0e37fddbc64cc913635cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1806929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maeve Brennan","original_name":"Maeve Brennan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b0e38bacb9fcdc0a35c3fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fuf6QgZ4DPar85TqisEuofnjps9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1260}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2025/event/open-city-documentary-festival-opening-night-siticulosa","release_date":"2025-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
