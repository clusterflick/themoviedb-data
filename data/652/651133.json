What moves it is the desire for creation, but this cannot be carried out freely without a process of accumulation: hence the need to leave the cave in which it finds itself in order to seek a comparison with the world around, to experiment and experiment. The tower, on the other hand, will represent an opportunity to test a process of redefining one's own identity, a questioning of the self that is possible only through the contemplation of another destiny.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2459926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Baroni","original_name":"Alberto Baroni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc49bc4284ea0011f8d06c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
