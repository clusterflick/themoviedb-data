The film chronicles the harrowing and hilarious adventures of three wildly different characters. The first, Manuel, is a salty 73-year old who attends illegal cockfights in California and fights to preserve the ancient but embattled sport. The second, Clara, is a vibrant Latina who was forced to quit cockfighting when the sport was outlawed in Arizona. The third, Larry, is a firebrand ex-patriot exiled to Mexico where he fights roosters for a living. Cockfight pierces the veil of secrecy that cloaks this enormously popular yet controversial activity. By bringing you in contact with people whose daily lives are defined by cockfighting, the film seeks to demonstrate how people can draw meaning, value and humor from something many see as savage and barbaric.","popularity":0.2228,"poster_path":"/8h72XJjpLomMoe7Ulbk0d23R3h7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Angry Young Ranch","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cockfight","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Cook","original_name":"Larry Cook","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ddd5e783faba0001302a018","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Costa","original_name":"Manuel Costa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ddd5e8a1c63290014fe543c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Godfrey","original_name":"Clara Godfrey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ddd5e9c4284ea0017faa986","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Holthouse","original_name":"David Holthouse","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/swWsQrdPpCvWvp2NdYQA3SUc5Rx.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"607bc9852b8a430029c97e36","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doyle Thompson","original_name":"Doyle Thompson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ddd5ed54284ea0011fa92ac","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054376,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Parrish King","original_name":"Adam Parrish King","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463e8ba8c44b9780cf60567","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiller Russell","original_name":"Tiller Russell","popularity":0.1943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5fdc4284ea0014fabb1c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiller Russell","original_name":"Tiller Russell","popularity":0.1943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5f151c63290014fe5501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415578,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Len Peterson","original_name":"Len Peterson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd601b1c63290012fe5811","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loren Mendell","original_name":"Loren Mendell","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5fd10cd44600122e5835","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Graham Tracey","original_name":"Graham Tracey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5f9ee8d0b40013f9f062","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loren Mendell","original_name":"Loren Mendell","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5f5c0cd44600122e5803","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiller Russell","original_name":"Tiller Russell","popularity":0.1943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5f26e8d0b40018f9f64f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loren Mendell","original_name":"Loren Mendell","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd5fba0cd44600122e582c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0379739","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8h72XJjpLomMoe7Ulbk0d23R3h7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1721,"name":"fight"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New York International Independent Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
