Together with Erod's dour Albert and Ileana Tonca's Sophie-clearly in love with Werther herself-the drama is set out with unusual clarity and realism.Philippe Jordan ensures that Massenet's pent-up emotion explodes exactly on cue,its expressive power providing impossible to resist.","popularity":0.2362,"poster_path":"/dbiFVbq6OlVJCwYhXOjKPYirg9G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2005-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Werther","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Álvarez","original_name":"Marcelo Álvarez","popularity":0.1324,"profile_path":"/cs1e8vXhhAkH8ECq1FhpewriD9q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Werther","credit_id":"5ddd93e6d400f300137dadf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":471356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Garanca","original_name":"Elina Garanca","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/2xLi7RtxE1j2FQMuaXvVXkRjIr2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"5ddd94094284ea0017faf22e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Eröd","original_name":"Adrian Eröd","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"5ddd9459e8d0b40013fa3078","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Tonca","original_name":"Ileana Tonca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5ddd94721c63290017fe9993","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Šramek","original_name":"Alfred Šramek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uV8xHCOY4z6dLYWP1OaSn6B88UT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Le Bailli","credit_id":"5ddd948b0cd44600192ec11d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Jelosits","original_name":"Peter Jelosits","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Schmidt","credit_id":"5ddd94a44f58010012f93943","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Pelz","original_name":"Markus Pelz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Johann","credit_id":"5ddd94bae8d0b40013fa322e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clemens Unterreiner","original_name":"Clemens Unterreiner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Brühlmann","credit_id":"5ddd94d2a806730017141fa9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Gusenleitner","original_name":"Maria Gusenleitner","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Käthchen","credit_id":"5ddd94ea4f58010016f95d35","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jordan","original_name":"Philippe Jordan","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/sSPyOAw49EgfxKeoD9ziM89HA1j.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self -
