From the back alleys of the Plateau to artists’ apartments, from a passionate recycling advocate to a queen of the night, everyday heroes are the subject of this final film. They are humble folk, faithful to their personal ethical sense, determined to make the world more beautiful. They are true adventurers, especially as seen by Michka Saäl.","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mavericks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1693074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michka Saäl","original_name":"Michka Saäl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd6e2fa80673001213816f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426121,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sylvestre Guidi","original_name":"Sylvestre Guidi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd6e3e4f58010016f92e9c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468396,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xi Feng","original_name":"Xi Feng","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd6e8e4284ea0014facb4a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
