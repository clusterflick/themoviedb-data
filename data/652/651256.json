A usual lonely night. While he is playing mechanically with his pasta soup, a woman enters, running away from the storm. The man, confused in front of this apparition, is looking for a solution with his nose in his soup. His pasta soup is answering him. 'Soup' is the suspended time, the side comment thanks to the rain, that shows how a man can deal with the opportunity to change his life.","popularity":0.0972,"poster_path":"/goBfgFb33urtETvImh5USN5SXON.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cassiopée Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":580584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvan Garouel","original_name":"Yvan Garouel","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/3fAEO392nxYpDPaASrmNaDr4hF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"5ddd345e3faba0001902a3d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Legrand","original_name":"Suzanne Legrand","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Madeleine","credit_id":"5ddd34784f58010016f8e6d2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie Lagarde","original_name":"Stéphanie Lagarde","popularity":0.1408,"profile_path":"/hIGb8DlqvJ4RYxlKigX11ixDyhe.jpg","credit_id":"5ddd34cc4f5801000ff8b91f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie Lagarde","original_name":"Stéphanie Lagarde","popularity":0.1408,"profile_path":"/hIGb8DlqvJ4RYxlKigX11ixDyhe.jpg","credit_id":"5ddd34d34f58010016f8e765","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2765122","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/goBfgFb33urtETvImh5USN5SXON.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
