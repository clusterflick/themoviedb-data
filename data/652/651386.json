A machinist by trade, Mouchet retired nearly two decades ago, but his obsession with precision and detail has continued.  To date, he has created 48 carousels; each is a functioning masterpiece that is constructed to be exactly 1/20 scale of the original. Mouchet works from photographs and measurements he has taken over the years of carousels that have toured France and across Europe. Mouchet tediously prepares shop drawings and hand-tooled parts, analyzing the different modes of assembly and the varying principles of movement.  He combines an expertise in engineering with whimsical recreations of the carnival atmosphere, replete with electrical motors, lights, signage, transport trucks and miniature people, made by him and hand-painted by his wife, Georgette.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":"/agXcPvTLiN5ZQjIVfhtbZox6boN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poetry of Exactitude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Po√©sie de l'exactitude","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Govenar","original_name":"Alan Govenar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddd94c2a806730017141fa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1382521","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/agXcPvTLiN5ZQjIVfhtbZox6boN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":547}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
