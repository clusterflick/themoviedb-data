Most people are put off by the fact that it has 5 acts, therefore they conclude that it must be incredibly long. It is long but not as long as some people may fear as most of the acts are under half an hour each. The total length of the DVD in question is 171 minutes, just under 3 hours, including titles at the beginning, applauses and curtain calls between the acts and at the end. The opera contains Verdi's most powerful overture and a number of very elegant arias, duets and ensembles for the principals.","popularity":0.1581,"poster_path":"/2Z3nYZKLh4VwJiGO682z6OsEMqC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12638,"logo_path":null,"name":"NVC
