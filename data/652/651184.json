His name is Dan Mark - nothing less! - and his life is a state of constant action, which in no small bit is due to his diagnosed ADHD, but which can't reduce him to a social case study. On the contrary, Rødbro is at a highly energetic eye level with the young man, whose parents and friends pour good advice down on him about the life that he is about to become adult in. A piece of modern street documentary by one of the Danish film scene's most promising names.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dan Mark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1681636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Marie Rødbro","original_name":"Eva Marie Rødbro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc9f724f58010012f7e52a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
