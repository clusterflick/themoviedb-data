In two parallel stories, a son’s desire to be free is shown as he struggles from his father’s oppressive domination. This is shown on the one hand by a boy who watches over his father in his sickbed wishing to free himself from his father’s domineering presence; and on the other, a biblical Isaac who frees himself from Abraham’s intent to kill his own son.","popularity":0.1543,"poster_path":"/7CFFY13E7pitEz2JLQ7IuwKTJty.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isaak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony
