He thus sails to Greenland, where he spends all he's got to buy a polar bear to bring as a gift to the Danish monarch. We then follow Audun's adventures in Norway, Denmark, Rome and then again in his homeland, a much richer man than when he left.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lbGEarwy1gqm2qogehSEMLLKEBt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1993-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Audun and the Polar Bear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigurdur Brynjolfsson","original_name":"Sigurdur Brynjolfsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc4655cdf2e600133b186c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467612,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Algimantas Taujanskas","original_name":"Algimantas Taujanskas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc466b4f58010016f74e0d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbGEarwy1gqm2qogehSEMLLKEBt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
