She crossed 11 countries involved in wars, hitchhiking with another Milanese artist, Silvia Moro, both wearing a wedding dress.  This was a performance for peace, trust and hoping to prove that if you rely on others, you’ll receive good things only.  After travelling many roads, the two artists decided to split for a while in Istanbul, planning to meet again in Byblos. Pippa left then, alone, and nobody heard from her again.","popularity":0.512,"poster_path":"/oi28aNQHway4dihfcbL98AIzJTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nacne","origin_country":""},{"id":110397,"logo_path":null,"name":"A+E
