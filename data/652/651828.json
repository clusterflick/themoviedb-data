The uplifting Second \"Resurrection\" Symphony, with which Bernstein had an especially long and close association, is recorded here in a historic performance from 1973, set in the Romanesque splendor of Ely Cathedral. In the Third, Bernstein encompasses the symphony's spiritual panorama like no other conductor, with the Vienna Philharmonic players alive to every nuance.","popularity":0.5053,"poster_path":"/zRWfqc3xdLdrjknehi3AOQPusb3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1973-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":246,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler - Symphonies Nos. 1, 2 & 3","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5ddfe64c4f58010012fce547","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheila Armstrong","original_name":"Sheila Armstrong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ddfe664202e110011203e57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1411502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Baker","original_name":"Janet Baker","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ddfe67563e6fb001444ee49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa Ludwig","original_name":"Christa Ludwig","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/wGh2rAEQVelko9bN4d0qVkfFUgb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ddfe692202e110011203eb1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"London Symphony Orchestra","original_name":"London Symphony Orchestra","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff35c3c46e75f0041d49618","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff35c435507e900400de08b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddfe6b8c51acd0013f37adf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustav Mahler","original_name":"Gustav Mahler","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/21kYlDN9JDw4cKw3Bs3pZyu81t0.jpg","credit_id":"5ddfe6c5202e110011203f1f","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRWfqc3xdLdrjknehi3AOQPusb3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":951},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/guz4ElmQS2wmeZuybWHMcvAT330.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
