Taking the shape of a photo-novel, the documentary not only recounts the founding members lives as trans women under the Argentine dictatorship (1976-1983), the AIDS epidemy, state repression and mass assassinations but also years of fighting for their rights, sorority and the exaltation of life and laughter in times of death.  Filming each one of them is filming them embracing their new role as curators, archivists and historians while a collection of 7,000 photos goes through the filter of their memories.","popularity":0.4437,"poster_path":"/lD0lA6uStmNlPwoQCuMFhbVFhD7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125832,"logo_path":"/m0myubEa2qBvRmiQNHoD9gXrB3Q.png","name":"La Belle Affaire Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Memories Revealed","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivo Aichenbaum","original_name":"Ivo Aichenbaum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddeaf111c63290017005367","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Federico Nipoli","original_name":"Federico Nipoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddeaec90cd44600123049dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agustina Pérez Rial","original_name":"Agustina Pérez Rial","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddeaf340cd4460012304a7a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774362,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Flore Cavigneaux","original_name":"Flore Cavigneaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddeae971c63290017005264","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armin Reiland","original_name":"Armin Reiland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddeaeef88bbe6001819605e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Worthington","original_name":"Quentin Worthington","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ygjdxxiN1RVsg8bPMoJ2Q2ASnoA.jpg","credit_id":"5ddeae693faba00019049d1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Worthington","original_name":"Quentin Worthington","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ygjdxxiN1RVsg8bPMoJ2Q2ASnoA.jpg","credit_id":"5ddeae833faba00019049d2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2469094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Worthington","original_name":"Quentin Worthington","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ygjdxxiN1RVsg8bPMoJ2Q2ASnoA.jpg","credit_id":"5ddeaf003faba00013047778","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286011,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jerôme Blesson","original_name":"Jerôme Blesson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebaa233cc277c00206ea4ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1459,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQVoSaokA78zl5qNlNQV9JTOXVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2594},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lLJkS8kb62Wl33Z4iHjTce8COA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lD0lA6uStmNlPwoQCuMFhbVFhD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208798,"name":"trans woman"},{"id":229325,"name":"transgender rights"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
