Recorded in Israel, Vienna and later in London, it is punctuated by biographical interludes and illustrated by musical examples drawn from the cycle of Mahler's works recorded by Bernstein. Bernstein talks, plays and conducts various orchestras (Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Wiener Philharmoniker) and soloists (Janet Baker, Christa Ludwig, Edith Mathis, Lucia Popp, Walton Groenroos) in performances spanning 17 years. Leonard Bernstein also examines the roots of Gustav Mahler's inspiration. The programme also features music from the nine symphonies, 'The Song of the Earth' and the 'Wunderhorn Cycle'.","popularity":0.3654,"poster_path":"/c0qd3dwDs4qm65nC735UDL6wWMT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Drummer Boy: An Essay on Mahler by Leonard Bernstein","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bernstein on Mahler","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dddacbf3faba000130308f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1411502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Baker","original_name":"Janet Baker","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dddacdc1c63290017feb908","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa Ludwig","original_name":"Christa Ludwig","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/wGh2rAEQVelko9bN4d0qVkfFUgb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dddacea4f58010012f95791","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1310970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Mathis","original_name":"Edith Mathis","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/wUZBeqOO3LuA14dI5kDu55bpgEn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dddacfb4284ea0011faee39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Popp","original_name":"Lucia Popp","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/2fBlAH3CT0rjhyQLHEQyqqTarQA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dddad0a4284ea0011faee61","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walton Grönroos","original_name":"Walton Grönroos","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dddad1f4f58010016f97538","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6585d9f24da3d41d284115df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Butler","original_name":"Peter Butler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dddad4f4f58010016f9754a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustav Mahler","original_name":"Gustav Mahler","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/21kYlDN9JDw4cKw3Bs3pZyu81t0.jpg","credit_id":"5dddad604f5801000ff94d4a","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1638950","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c0qd3dwDs4qm65nC735UDL6wWMT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/otVCptRl0tURDNLpIlw8pqUqjpz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210633,"name":"mahler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
