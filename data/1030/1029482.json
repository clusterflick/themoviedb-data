Hamza struggles to reach a peaceful place. Despite his wife’s pleadings and the villagers’ contempt, Hamza sits his baits and traps in the forest, hoping to defeat the mysterious threat. He finds refuge in his journey from social rejection and denial. In the woods, Hamza is free to act according to his beliefs, fighting his own battle to heal an open wound – the trauma of losing his childhood friend, and the horrific memories of torture and guilt.","popularity":0.1476,"poster_path":"/47HsNjVGQXB6VhWYhglsMzFIVEg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183174,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hiba Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamza - Chasing the Ghost Chasing Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1585765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamel El Basha","original_name":"Kamel El Basha","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/x7y9taclO7bfZGW024ESN66SAxm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63341340dd4716008bca62f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":996262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruba Blal","original_name":"Ruba Blal","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/jkCJlJKrNCTRfht4soCU1kBs9D0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"633413497f0540007ab19e81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3120512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Motaz Malhees","original_name":"Motaz Malhees","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/zJpFeotJjnlCDzPJldh2HnCGWnJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63341352764841007d2e0934","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khoulod Tannous","original_name":"Khoulod Tannous","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"633413706082eb00883e8f6e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3718883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ward Kayyal","original_name":"Ward Kayyal","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334137b6082eb00800c6b5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718884,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Majd Kayyal","original_name":"Majd Kayyal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334138ddd4716007ea0f6ee","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2552423,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ashraf Dowani","original_name":"Ashraf Dowani","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334139d024ec8007abaf071","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2293911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Saed Andoni","original_name":"Saed Andoni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633413ab229ae20080722c28","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hiba Salameh","original_name":"Hiba Salameh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633413d20e64af00840690b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/47HsNjVGQXB6VhWYhglsMzFIVEg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"Cairo International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
