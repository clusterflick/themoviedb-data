Myopia, or \"difficulty seeing far away,\" is a global problem. The World Health Organization has sounded the alarm. But in Japan, more and more reports show that myopia is increasingly severe among children and continues to get worse as they grow. The latest research shows that myopia increases the risk of eye disorders such as cataracts and glaucoma. It also reveals a correlation with depression, dementia, and other conditions that have no obvious link to the eyes.  This documentary investigates what is happening to the eyes and how we should change our lifestyle to protect them.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes in a Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ikeda Shuhei","original_name":"Ikeda Shuhei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334211a209f18009d7f1a03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021827,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Ooishi Hiroto","original_name":"Ooishi Hiroto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63342149229ae2008072339c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ishihama Ryo","original_name":"Ishihama Ryo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334212e6082eb00883e9828","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nakayama Tatsuki","original_name":"Nakayama Tatsuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63342152209f180085da493b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nakamura Takunori","original_name":"Nakamura Takunori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334213b024ec8007abaf7ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
