The wisened Calabrian invites the viewer into his sun-washed world of bright orange sun umbrellas, cool blue seas, freshly baked pastries and fresh vegetables.  Directed by Jan Vrhovnik, written by Ana Kerin and music score by Oscar-winning Nico Casal, Paradiso is less story and more a poetic thought piece. Dipping into a snapshot of life for an aging man from Italy, whimsical moments like the swatting of a fly are interspersed with provocative thoughts on life that can only come with the wisdom of an older man who has seen it all.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/89rH21xlg35jQVLxjmXMUKERVFS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Discover the secret to living the good life in this sun-kissed silhouette of the Calabrian coast","title":"Paradiso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Mancusou","original_name":"Giovanni Mancusou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6335f31185702e007db6b82e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3417458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Vrhovnik","original_name":"Jan Vrhovnik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6335f2e62cde98007e4142e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Kerin","original_name":"Ana Kerin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6335f2f189d97f00827c8be8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matej Marinko","original_name":"Matej Marinko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6335f2fb2cde9800927ddcf2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nico Casal","original_name":"Nico Casal","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6335f305cb75d1009536f01d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/89rH21xlg35jQVLxjmXMUKERVFS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
