Lupine opens with a young man adoring a Lupine plant, a vibrant wildflower that grows throughout the Mediterranean and marks the beginning of Spring and new life. “I think there are certain moments in our youth where we feel completely light and careless, like we are in a flow,” says Werner, who followed a group of three real-life friends on a coastal sojourn across Rhodes. “I don’t believe that these moments end when we grow up. I believe we get a glimpse of them from time to time.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qBNBgr7pCAGu1vLNYgldrlYnr4r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":183233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meditate on this sunlit snapshot of high-diving youth in Greece","title":"Lupine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Werner","original_name":"Luca Werner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334f948afe224007e1b178b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qBNBgr7pCAGu1vLNYgldrlYnr4r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lupine (2021) A film by Luca Werner | COMMAS","key":"SqDsI0bh5Sk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-10T23:52:36.000Z","id":"6334f970bbd0b0007fd0e37f"}]}}}
