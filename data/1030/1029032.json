Mainly told through a native narrative, it reclaims the memory of a colonial past. Switching the roles of observer and observed, it is anthropology-and specifically the desire underlying anthropological representation, that is depicted as an object of curiosity destabilized by the villager's questions. Point of departure was Kaiang Tapior's question \"Where is your helicopter?\", a remark which puzzled the filmmaker during his visit to the village of Pepera.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/mfQlMiQEAaLBbsDjWOJYnpNyQGa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kobarweng or Where Is Your Helicopter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"63324dfdc525c4007fee7fac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6612550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mfQlMiQEAaLBbsDjWOJYnpNyQGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
