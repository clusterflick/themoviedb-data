The mission is simple: aliens must capture and record living specimens from earth. However a violent earthquake forces the ship to take off whilst a giant robot, used to collect specimens, is swallowed up in the eruption. During quarry excavations in the present day the robot is re-animated, and the mission is still on.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":"/y3pnRJ2FZ0yOfWQhp29JMaevch0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gothic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Specimens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Spence","original_name":"Roy Spence","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/tU2Ea24rp1bTEwOJ7JktGHbQVP8.jpg","credit_id":"6334ff2eafe224007e1b1a61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Spence","original_name":"Roy Spence","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/tU2Ea24rp1bTEwOJ7JktGHbQVP8.jpg","credit_id":"6334ff388c22c0007a4accbd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23773830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1916,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y3pnRJ2FZ0yOfWQhp29JMaevch0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1284}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Roy Spence: Specimens","key":"l_KIW5PzfeA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-07-12T11:59:55.000Z","id":"6334ff75c26796007c4321e2"}]}}}
