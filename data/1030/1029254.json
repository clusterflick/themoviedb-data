While people in Europe were suffering a crisis that made them lose memory and a sense of their culture, a group of youth in his village in Oaxaca was trying to document their own culture by making a film during Carnival rituals. While the youth are pushed to invite a director from the city to come help them, ultimately changing their project to be a remake of Ingmar Bergman’s THE SILENCE, a Swedish woman comes exploring in search of magical lizards that could be the next remedy for memory crisis back home. Characters mix and stories blend into each other in this absurdist and melancholic lo-fi/sci-fi story narrated as oral history with multiple voices.","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":130898,"logo_path":"/q8GClKMhw82ZrlPn5A3g6YwEHp.png","name":"Pensée Sauvage Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outlander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1138259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bani Khoshnoudi","original_name":"Bani Khoshnoudi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tjIR0BwDAUg1xyY2EHxRLkbVskL.jpg","credit_id":"63333196d3d387007d5b27a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
