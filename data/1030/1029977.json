At a temple in Kyoto, a Zen priest contemplates the metaphysical immortality held within a single breath.  Some years ago, filmmaker Spencer Macdonald read an article in The New York Times titled \"Can a Jellyfish Unlock the Secret of Immortality?\" by Nathaniel Rich. Comprehensive and insightful, the article is compelling not least for its potential to deliver a revelation that defies one of life’s most fundamental truths; that we all live then die. It also shines a light on the arrogance of the anthropocene, the evolving landscape of Shirahama, and a detailed insight into the life and work of the charming and fervently curious Dr. Shin Kubota, a warm and eccentric scientist determined to harness the biological secrets of a jellyfish for humanity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ba8MWh8RrGuAnzX9CQwx9fQT0oR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meditations on life and immortality with scientist Shin Kubota and Zen abbess Koju Kaji","title":"Scarlet Medusa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Kubota","original_name":"Shin Kubota","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6335f18c85702e007db6b7bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koju Kaji","original_name":"Koju Kaji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6335f199edeb43007a1f0a40","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Spencer MacDonald","original_name":"Spencer MacDonald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6335f181982f74007b84ef0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ba8MWh8RrGuAnzX9CQwx9fQT0oR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
