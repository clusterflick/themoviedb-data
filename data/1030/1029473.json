Northrop fought to get the flying wing into mass production - only to lose everything. But his dream became the B2 stealth bomber, 40 years later.\r This documentary takes us from the early days of the aviation designer to the final production and test flights of the Northrop B-49 \"Flying Wing\" jet bomber, which was 50 years ahead of its time and the first true \"stealth\" aircraft.\r The film contains archival video and interviews with the original test pilots and Northrop employees.","popularity":0.1292,"poster_path":"/vchHSHZUuehsuw661tHs3CsXK5B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82981,"logo_path":"/2zl1si6wU6VD0i5uOzwEai6xT1P.png","name":"Discovery Communications","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wing Will Fly: Northrop B-2 Stealth Bomber","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Northrop Jr.","original_name":"John Northrop Jr.","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63340fbd076ce80084c2af4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Coleman","original_name":"Ted Coleman","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63340fec0e64af007f35a5e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Myers","original_name":"John Myers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63341036a6fdaa007a1f14cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Benjamin","original_name":"John Benjamin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63341054076ce80084c2afb6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Maloney","original_name":"Ed Maloney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"633410720e64af0084068dfc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bion Provost","original_name":"Bion Provost","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63341086229ae20080722a0f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Larsent","original_name":"Bob Larsent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63341098a6fdaa007d4b3a26","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Wolford","original_name":"Roy Wolford","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"633410ac076ce800817ac55e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Chart","original_name":"Ira Chart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"633410cea6fdaa007a1f1524","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Stanley","original_name":"Max Stanley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"633410e9024ec80091a9b94e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cardenas","original_name":"Robert Cardenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"633411118a0e9b007b7c7e1a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James O.
