Intersecting several voices--adolescent girls, mothers, lesbians, dancers, bodybuilders...--this film draws a mosaic portrait of the breast, from childhood to maturity, from seduction to illness, from motherhood to surgery, from the tyranny of the image to self-acceptance. An impressionist documentary, funny and touching, against the backdrop of the beach and holidays.","popularity":0.1211,"poster_path":"/ko19ryo4kz3ekdOBBk3fAePmjWy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What place do breasts occupy in the identity of women?","title":"Les seins dans la tête","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1789798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Beauchemin","original_name":"Serge Beauchemin","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/yz9X3xAgZsLNGBU2DTA0dQGdBDc.jpg","credit_id":"63348e87d46537007ad683c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340601,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yves Gendron","original_name":"Yves Gendron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348e978a0e9b007e91d0b3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625497,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francine Poirier","original_name":"Francine Poirier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348ecfea89f5007d8d9cad","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288191,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetan Gravel","original_name":"Gaetan Gravel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348f0b78570e007c31ca65","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2311095,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josée Beaudet","original_name":"Josée Beaudet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348e506082eb00800c9fa3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serge LaForest","original_name":"Serge LaForest","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348f19229ae20097df3a34","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":10752,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominique Fortin","original_name":"Dominique Fortin","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348eb57f054000842d13ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Gervais","original_name":"Suzanne Gervais","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348ef77648410085352271","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mireille Dansereau","original_name":"Mireille Dansereau","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/ftKVuu6l6TJkTjfp4tPfUAlsQ1d.jpg","credit_id":"63348e0f8a0e9b0083f4b867","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mireille Dansereau","original_name":"Mireille Dansereau","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/ftKVuu6l6TJkTjfp4tPfUAlsQ1d.jpg","credit_id":"63348e348a0e9b007e91d090","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46437,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serge Boivin","original_name":"Serge Boivin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63348ee17f054000967bb890","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0237717","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ko19ryo4kz3ekdOBBk3fAePmjWy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
