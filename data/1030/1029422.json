The film documents a case study of an elderly lady who has been transferred to the university hospital in multisystem failure, accompanied by her husband and multiple suitcases of her belongings. Mrs Reynolds is a needy and demanding patient whose fears and anxieties are expressed by her annoying attempts to get attention, treating the nurses like servants and complaining about much of the care given to her. Mrs Reynolds' 8-month-long hospitalization showcases the importance of individualizing care, being aware of both emotional and physical needs, collaborating with other disciplines, and it demonstrates the nurse's role as a patient advocate with clinical competencies that were an early version of today's case managers.","popularity":0.1097,"poster_path":"/f9ZaysfniphsqzbwSsCg6iRf27n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smith, Kline & French Laboratories","origin_country":""},{"id":183162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Anderson Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Reynolds Needs a Nurse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dolores Little","original_name":"Dolores Little","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6333cf326082eb00883e682f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Olcott","original_name":"Virginia Olcott","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Reynolds","credit_id":"6333cf3ea14bef007de2eb29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Lee","original_name":"Martin Lee","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6333cf54d465370082a9f2be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3718618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxine L.
