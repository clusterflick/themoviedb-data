Instead of simply hiding, these young men and women - many of them teenagers -- banded together to fight back, carrying out deadly acts of sabotage, staging ambushes, and waging clandestine warfare against the Nazis and their collaborators. The Jewish Partisans tells the inspiring story of how these innocent young adults transformed into guerrilla soldiers, surviving - and ultimately triumphing - against extraordinary odds.
