He’s been produced by XTC’s Andy Partridge, and written for the likes of Captain Sensible of The Damned. Though it would be wrong to call him an \"unknown\", he has never been directly in the limelight. This film brings to light the amazing career and life work of the artist, who, on top of being the most published contemporary British poet as well as an established gardener, continues to record and release music today.","popularity":0.337,"poster_path":"/xPdU8xkqhHtorPPWdxD16h8Lowc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sharp Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Martin Newell is The Jangling Man","title":"The Jangling Man: The Martin Newell Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2663238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Newell","original_name":"Martin Newell","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/nwrlp0Im39cz43KsM7nDL6Kfekn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15bb7d5db50fc7f7c633","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Pratt","original_name":"Jessica Pratt","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/r3MXm90D0oLXigPC7zk9ctVQC68.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15c415376c3de44d53e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mac DeMarco","original_name":"Mac DeMarco","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/etJjQ75tvpc4L9EnatHcPaopgqA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15cc0e64af00adab97b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2221675,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Gregory","original_name":"Dave Gregory","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15d9c3aa3f00b6d6ae4d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Cole Smith","original_name":"Zachary Cole Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15e3befd91007c264c04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iain McNay","original_name":"Iain McNay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15ee15376c3daaf9c730","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Tatum","original_name":"Jack Tatum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"638e15f88d77c40083ee47b6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492148,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jim Larson","original_name":"Jim Larson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e15ae15376c3d9ae20bfd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sharp","original_name":"James Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e15990e64af00c25ea425","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Sharp","original_name":"James Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e158724418200a06c2a88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492148,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jim Larson","original_name":"Jim Larson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e15a82441820084a62933","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22334238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xPdU8xkqhHtorPPWdxD16h8Lowc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Martin Newell // The Jangling Man (Official Documentary Trailer)","key":"yyLFvggq-84","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-30T13:53:58.000Z","id":"63a370b320ecaf00850a6cde"}]}}}
