Young Masters: Baji Quan is the first episode and focuses on a 23-year-old man from Hebei province who is a stalwart practitioner of Baji Quan—a traditional Chinese fighting style known for its graceful stillness and sudden moments of targeted and ferocious violence.  Director Haonan Shen traveled to the Mengcun Baji Quan International Training Center to profile Wu Hao whose paternal ancestor Wu Zhong (1712–1802) was the first recorded Baji Quan teacher. In this evocative portrait of a young man’s passion for sharing his family’s rich heritage, we get up close and personal with the violent elbow strikes, staff jabs, fierce rising and firm falling stances that characterize the martial art.","popularity":0.0642,"poster_path":"/3yuVWi22SkuqgTqdhE6x83VFVLK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Discover the beautiful brutality of China’s most explosive Kung Fu style","title":"Baji Quan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3133534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shen Haonan","original_name":"申浩男","popularity":0.8754,"profile_path":"/j243zdIZjx0805OrbRZfMSjSdC5.jpg","credit_id":"6336493ea14bef007a05e3d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1225,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yuVWi22SkuqgTqdhE6x83VFVLK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":817}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
