The Levys of Monticello is a documentary film that tells the little-known story of the Levy family, which owned and carefully preserved Monticello for nearly a century â€“ far longer than Jefferson or his descendants. The remarkable story of the Levy family also intersects with the rise of antisemitism that runs throughout the course of American history.","popularity":1.3925,"poster_path":"/x23BWOC9liL9qtcCtt62JQsU9Qa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Monticello did not end with Jefferson","title":"The Levys of Monticello","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Pressman","original_name":"Steven Pressman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63345c1e8a0e9b0083f4a6b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23550198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktivUcdRQ1hqpECztfQ4Gz4BIbA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3556}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x23BWOC9liL9qtcCtt62JQsU9Qa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":961},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":826,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ge8JYZ74SaCUzibGu78yH0ggIyI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":287033,"name":"american history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Levys of Monticello - Theatrical Trailer","key":"1i4Ry1jSiUM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-06T20:39:32.000Z","id":"65a73ed738765101271a2668"}]}}}
