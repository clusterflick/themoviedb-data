M. A. Littler’s subtle, almost static, but powerfully affecting visual meditation, cued to Wright’s voice and a gossamer score, captures poetry as it comes into being, a beautiful rumination on the life of the poet, the poignancy of mortality, and the meaning of love that sustains the high note of lament for the dissipation of experience into memory, and memory into darkness, capturing it in its passage and caressing it as it goes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qt3lpRPsrgHaOdJzAkzA4yfNeha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Franz Wright","title":"Last Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1DeZSTLnG9LAryp1sLov9T3513l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qt3lpRPsrgHaOdJzAkzA4yfNeha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1143}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
