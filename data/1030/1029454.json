It alights and blankets the landscape, transforming it into a mythological scenery. Everything sounds differently: steps, children's jolly laughter, bells chiming in a distance, the public announcer at a ski race, even silence. Snow scrunches under the feet, and, after all, one moves differently: on skis, on a snowboard, on snowshoes, or on a sleigh, in a cable car, or, slower than normally, in a car on a slippery road. Being indispensible for the tourist industry, snow produces a linguistic paradoxon: snow guns to secure snow. Snow/Schnee explores the Semmering region in Lower Austria in 23 deep winter motifs: a film to listen to, a soundscape to see.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SNOW | SCHNEE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Neuwirth","original_name":"Manfred Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mgxc4ejAmB3Jnqa6b3K0ZxwjwtJ.jpg","credit_id":"6333f89f8a0e9b0083f474b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
