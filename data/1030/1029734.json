Earnest, passionate and devoted to his parents, the young man proves to his family and peets, that Down’s Syndrome does not get in the way of achieving your dreams.  Director Ariel Danziger took a very different approach to the filming of Ritmo del Agua. It’s light-footed, monochrome depiction of Herrera’s interior world is a far cry from the glossy, cinematic pacing of previous projects, such as Somewhere and Jamila. Instead, Danziger shoots straight for the heart in a pared-down documentary profile stitched together using the protagonist’s emotional bonds.","popularity":0.1384,"poster_path":"/rcDVqfwZJ0gN6rmIW8cHRxof2KS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2020-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take a plunge into this profile of a champion Mexican swimmer changing perceptions of Down’s Syndrome","title":"Ritmo del Agua","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426480,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manuel Velasco","original_name":"Manuel Velasco","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334ffb4982f7400836ab5e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2724304,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William Zitser","original_name":"William Zitser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334ffa4bbd0b0007fd0e605","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rcDVqfwZJ0gN6rmIW8cHRxof2KS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
