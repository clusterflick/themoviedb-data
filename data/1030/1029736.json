No Somos De Aquí, Ni Somos De Allá is the most personal project I've directed thus far.\"  Aguirre shines a spotlight on young people's experiences of growing up in the culture of two countries. The delicately shot portraits reaveal the rich diversity of thought and expression from people who consider themselves both Mexian and American. \"The film had been percolating in my mind for over two years,\" says Aguirre. \"It consists of a lot of internal dialogues that I've had with myself as a filmmaker and as a first-generation American.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/8swjTzJDzJA4mpdaYp3fRGYbTu1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A celebration of Mexican-American biculturalism","title":"No Somos De Aquí, Ni Somos De Allá","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3077643,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leo Aguirre","original_name":"Leo Aguirre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633501fafa78cd00a34554c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8swjTzJDzJA4mpdaYp3fRGYbTu1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
