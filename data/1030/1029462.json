After an exhaustive recording process elsewhere I visited the synagogue en route to the airport to quickly record a solo piece. The engineer and I had only a couple of hours to capture something before catching our flight home to Montreal. Microphones were set up at varying distances throughout the synagogue and I improvised a solo piece using the acoustics of the space. We had just enough time to record what became an 18 minute multi-tracked piece. Every layer was a first take and a response to the previous.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gates of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2584669,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Sharp","original_name":"Jason Sharp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63340396209f18009d7f0965","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Vallée","original_name":"Guillaume Vallée","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jZu3mvAqOnudTXVSpiojibXWwFn.jpg","credit_id":"6334038a209f18007dcd995f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
