daughter.","popularity":0.3825,"poster_path":"/hiVe3nDpkTGolmClr2rG2I2vANp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1953-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Una
