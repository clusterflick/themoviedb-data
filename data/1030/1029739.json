Also, my anxiety about the trip was forged by the false idea that we must have control over everything—a state of mind imposed on us by big cities. But I set this aside and ended up embarking on one of my most pleasant documentary experiences.”  Veio is a short film that immerses the audience into the isolated universe of a self-taught artist who looks to nature to guide his work and philosophy. Veio spent much of his formative years in the company of adults, gradually developing an interest in bygone eras and the recent past. This earned him the nickname Veio—meaning ‘old’ in Portuguese.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9e00cy0izoWyVth1iJxNJDiyAT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94246,"logo_path":"/hrAQVo8JaIBLx7Crk8DqmfFg19B.png","name":"Nowness","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An inspiring portrait of a Brazillian artist bringing new life to dead trees","title":"Veio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Veio: Life as a Work of Art","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Lion","original_name":"André Lion","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633503bfafe224007e1b1c44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9e00cy0izoWyVth1iJxNJDiyAT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
