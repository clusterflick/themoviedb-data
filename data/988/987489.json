The literal translation is 'circling the mountain,' so the mountain itself and a connection to nature is crucial; it has a more meditative meaning, it is part of a lineage of enlightenment wisdom that spans centuries, ages and generations.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endurance Test: The 1000 Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Olita","original_name":"Ivan Olita","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a833d25a5ed00066e81f56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
