There are various reasons why our protagonists chose to live in the homesteads, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Some were done with spending too much time in an office,  traffic and living a virtual life, they wanted real, tangible things. Some have moved to countryside by their own choice, but some by predisposition of their families. But what unites them all - they aspire for the stability provided by their own land and house.  Together with our protagonists, we will spend one year’s cycle of farmer’s life, that will start with the spring sowing and finish with the autumn harvest and land preparation for the next year.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/3FspDTVehL7nxmv73dqMT8FNnXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Seleckis","original_name":"Ivars Seleckis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fTMcZgbtqfFFxUhgTTc5rwUaQ4s.jpg","credit_id":"62a8f685a8b2ca0068d86551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596246,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andris Vanadziņš","original_name":"Andris Vanadziņš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63232ea4f14dad008288a14e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907341,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dace Dzenovska","original_name":"Dace Dzenovska","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63232eb6fd4a96007f61dafc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308264,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valdis Celmiņš","original_name":"Valdis Celmiņš","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/bIUeLfSpth5h0uD4wTrqO4OisXo.jpg","credit_id":"63232ecb244182007f8c8030","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604659,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kārlis Auzāns","original_name":"Kārlis Auzāns","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/fMlOa8ag3OTan5azmwxrHXhBQqT.jpg","credit_id":"63232eddf14dad007d6227ea","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Armands Začs","original_name":"Armands Začs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6xvyKUtUt7y9SGofrTxkvE3CnVH.jpg","credit_id":"63232eef13a320007dc49d99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699652,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernests Ansons","original_name":"Ernests Ansons","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63232f4e244182007f8c8059","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gints Grūbe","original_name":"Gints Grūbe","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/6GGLvVF0lsMjs8RsW6PR9S16eaR.jpg","credit_id":"63232f5f3d35570084229a70","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","original_name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63232f701b722c007fee301e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784923,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annija Korpa","original_name":"Annija Korpa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63232f7df14dad008288a1a8","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22188360","wikidata_id":"Q130380650","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6pYZo2ozjwAUBkedvvWGI5P8GYT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3FspDTVehL7nxmv73dqMT8FNnXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Splendid Palace","release_date":"2022-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2022-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2022  | Trailer | The Land","key":"LSIvnFv7e5Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-04T12:20:33.000Z","id":"65dccecb1cc4ff0186fd66dc"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Land by Ivars Seleckis.
