Maestro Nathalie Stutzmann makes her Met debut conducting a star-studded cast led by baritone Peter Mattei as a magnetic Don Giovanni, alongside the Leporello of bass-baritone Adam Plachetka. Sopranos Federica Lombardi, Ana María Martínez, and Ying Fang make a superlative trio as Giovanni’s conquests—Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Zerlina—and tenor Ben Bliss is Don Ottavio.","popularity":0.5058,"poster_path":"/cxInjGt3Ujvy4WefPqEic4odKki.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":195,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Met Opera Live in HD- Don Giovanni","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Don Giovanni","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Mattei","original_name":"Peter Mattei","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/f2JpqPiMjArGx0QOju4IPHbmUPV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"62a90bf271f0950066835119","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana María Martínez","original_name":"Ana María Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Donna Anna","credit_id":"62a90bba5a5ed0009a2838dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federica Lombardi","original_name":"Federica Lombardi","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/wTboohyygUIYAMrfpAbDDTluZHr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donna Elvira","credit_id":"62a90ba705b54973b1b893fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2771399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ying Fang","original_name":"Ying Fang","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/8u14g3fZNaZOl0miaGQiLImOXxx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"62a90be022af3e321384e2ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2593680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Bliss","original_name":"Ben Bliss","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6Z8vnXAaZkW6EQjRyi1vXvthDqH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Don Ottavio","credit_id":"62a90be65541fa0066bb2801","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Plachetka","original_name":"Adam Plachetka","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/gzzgPuMJkFsEodjrjCRND3akEOr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"62a90c126f31af0098744af1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Walker","original_name":"Alfred Walker","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/7smSY0U7AhFKhvLcnVxnmuE4lwW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"62a90c22eb14fa09de0ba0e9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Tsymbalyuk","original_name":"Alexander Tsymbalyuk","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/ofWx0UDQ0jxEpabqK4cXwFEo6ph.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Commendatore","credit_id":"62a90c2a907f26009c022ee2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Morley","original_name":"Erin Morley","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/wy0ZL6gbltavBKAp2dRaWN7xpF6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self -
