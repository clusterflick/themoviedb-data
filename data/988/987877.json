Owen has been banned from most of the mainstream platforms and services for being unafraid to voice his opinions on a wide range of topics, but the politically correct censors couldn't stop him from building a community. The Bears seek to bypass the degeneracy of modern society and answer the question of \"now what?\". It is about growing and self-sustainability - no matter the scale. This documentary focuses on how a crowd-funded project starts taking shape: the building of cabins on undeveloped land in Northern Idaho. It highlights people who are united in their goal of creating a place where they can get together and have fun.","popularity":0.3594,"poster_path":"/9xzdMkcsieZni8jXatMBQDu78tF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":247643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unbearables Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Building Beartaria: an inspiring story in 2021","title":"Building Beartaria Beartaria Rises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":477074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Benjamin","original_name":"Owen Benjamin","popularity":0.2408,"profile_path":"/mLpl3z8hS7KH3ljEGYYRqpoOglh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a97979bbd0b00050828d66","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":477074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Benjamin","original_name":"Owen Benjamin","popularity":0.2408,"profile_path":"/mLpl3z8hS7KH3ljEGYYRqpoOglh.jpg","credit_id":"62a9798b65e0a21c6a6c5d83","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":477074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Benjamin","original_name":"Owen Benjamin","popularity":0.2408,"profile_path":"/mLpl3z8hS7KH3ljEGYYRqpoOglh.jpg","credit_id":"62a979a0124c8d0050a7feec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9xzdMkcsieZni8jXatMBQDu78tF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Building Beartaria Part Two: Beartaria Rises Trailer","key":"wbF76oIpo5U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-12-17T21:57:31.000Z","id":"62a979687e12f00e260b6a33"}]}}}
