He definitely danced to his own drummer. He could play a shy, lovable man like Latka Gravas on \"Taxi\", and then turn around and play Tony Clifton, an obnoxious, crude Lounge Lizzard. He was also one of the Great \"Put on Artists\" of our time. He also put on the world with his wrestling fiasco involving Jerry Lawler who eventually slapped Andy out of his chair on The Letterman Show. It was all staged!!  Come on along with us and follow Andy's career from early childhood, with exclusive family shots, to his untimely death at 35. Even then, his close friends didn't believe it.
