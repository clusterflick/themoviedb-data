We visit Eleochori, Messinia and talk to the elderly residents who stubbornly decided to rebuild their village when it was destroyed in the earthquake of 86. But time and the modernization of life have left the village empty as most left for Kalamata or even larger city in Greece.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/8ZKL4bGBtnAfte2LhppzZocMuG8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Did the modernization in our villages make them unable to do the natural disasters?","title":"Roots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4079770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolas Sampson","original_name":"Nikolas Sampson","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64752f3dc2823a00c42141ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ZKL4bGBtnAfte2LhppzZocMuG8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kvA9IIeDtxjc0EQ4g8IgGrDRKHe.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"5th Panorama","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"5th Panorama","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
