MARKET THIS! is a timely documentary that explores the desire for radical politics and culture in the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Two-Spirited and Transgender community. The documentary began in 1999 after the Queeruption gathering in New York City. During workshops and caucuses and through discussion and entertainment, participants came together to explore ways that this community can sustain and validate itself without supporting a system that actively exploits poor people, women, People of Color, g/b/l/TS/t people. This video takes the dialogue from Queeruption one step further. MARKET THIS! considers both the successes as well as the problems which resulted most visibly (and ironically) from a lack of involvement and presence of People of Color and Transgender people.","popularity":0.2677,"poster_path":"/inniFYos9tF68P2HddXtg8rTB8M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paper Tiger Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Market This!: Queer Radicals Respond to Gay Assimilation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Huh","original_name":"Kate Huh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494520a89b56100e29dd4f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Lollo","original_name":"Maria Lollo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64945214af6e9401256536bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4125001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tara Mateik","original_name":"Tara Mateik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494522089b56100ff63b5ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/inniFYos9tF68P2HddXtg8rTB8M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":222461,"name":"people of color"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
