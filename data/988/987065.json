It reveals radical Black and Indigenous feminist networks and thought that could shape what is to come. It drinks deeply from the art and activism of the incomparable Jewelle Gomez, Ioway & African American, Wampanoag, and Cape Verdean lesbian elder. Her life and work replenish humanity with fierce hope as her power swells into the world, from histories of Massasoit and her great-grandmotherâ€™s buckskin dress, queer Black ancestors, and slavery-era vampires to starry regenerative futures.","popularity":0.1329,"poster_path":"/AP4XU7p7Vu3E5fLcAZgdfWaj51.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Queer Women of
