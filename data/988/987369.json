One of them, Béla learns that the TV news showed a former classmate of them, Frike Herner, whose father was the village's policeman when they were children. Béla recalls how at that time a childish conflict between the two of them grew to a great extent. As he remembers more and more details, begins to realize that human destinies repeat themselves from generation to generation and are just as constant as the always-the-same ditch in front of them. Comical and sometimes painfully thought-provoking story through present and past try to find the answers to questions ranging from the individual to the entire world: are we in God's hand, or is God inside us, and can we shape our own destiny? The film is based on the play of the popular Hungarian writer, János Háy.","popularity":0.1235,"poster_path":"/eKXE9tXxGa4q9PTiQA3thGVzca5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
