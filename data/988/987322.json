Its central theme concerns the predetermined beauty standards which are imposed by the western society on women. A fundamental aesthetic and thematic purpose of the film is the provocation of intense, disturbing and shocking feelings through the graphic images, the inconvenient sounds and the audiovisual repetitions.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/epZAjya9eZuLpLhGoXDN4c2V8TO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dollhouse","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3587160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sotiria Papantoniou","original_name":"Sotiria Papantoniou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a791cd5541fa0050caea9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3587160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sotiria Papantoniou","original_name":"Sotiria Papantoniou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a791dc5541fa00a30ad795","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/epZAjya9eZuLpLhGoXDN4c2V8TO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"6th Panorama (TIFF - John Cassavetes)\t","release_date":"2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"6th Panorama (A.U.Th Campus)","release_date":"2022-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"6th Panorama (Cinobo)","release_date":"2022-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"6th Panorama (Greek Film Archive)\t","release_date":"2022-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
