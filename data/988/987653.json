As its disembodied gaze wanders through the base's empty greenhouses and searches through the crew's logs for something that could explain their sudden departure, the boundaries between nature and the artificial, mind and programming, waking and dreaming begin to blur, until a vision of our future emerges, one where we have been freed from the constraints of our biology, and where our digital ghosts haunt hallucinogenic reproductions of a lost Earth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bc97jMJYnNCiEqtfjl6cy9s2Jhr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sadovnik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas L.
