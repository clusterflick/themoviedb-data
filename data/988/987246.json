Inspired by the book The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams, \"Velveteen\" chronicles a black queer man's journey from self-hatred and repression to self-discovery and acceptance. With dance and poetry, we follow our protagonist as he navigates ancestral trauma, racism, and homophobia to heal himself, find community, and live an authentic life free from the expectations of others.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/q8dh16D6qJJXYikTxZqEmLcEUUM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Velveteen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3572002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David J.
