Or did he? Certainly not without the homophobia, insensitivity and blatant lack of knowledge which plagues the whole of government around such issues. “Transformer AIDS” looks at the governmental response to AIDS at this crucial point in history, when activism forced the issue onto the public agenda. A sarcastically funny, yet poignant critique engineered spearheaded by critic Bob Kinney.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transformer AIDS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
