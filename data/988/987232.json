The film speaks volumes about their lives as well as the twilight of life itself. Two old sisters with their Stoic philosophy, tell the story of their hard works, way of living, as well as a tragedy of husband´s accidental death and more than that, tell the story of countless honourable poor people on every continent. There is an unique interaction and universal human relationship between a Bangladeshi filmmaker and two old Portuguese shepherd despite language and socio-cultural barrier. This film was produced as a “graduation film” for the Erasmus Mundus DocNomads master program in documentary film-directing.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qDjWaaAGLV4FlCz8xS9KcyuhHWP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Passage","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohel Rahman","original_name":"Sohel Rahman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7621405b54973b2e55d00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohel Rahman","original_name":"Sohel Rahman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7621cd5569718c6ad9897","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohel Rahman","original_name":"Sohel Rahman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a761e33e2ec8006530eae0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Pehböck","original_name":"Tobias Pehböck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7620665e0a200515c287d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohel Rahman","original_name":"Sohel Rahman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a761f13e2ec8005053cd16","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohel Rahman","original_name":"Sohel Rahman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a761fc1684f7349fff6b03","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Pehböck","original_name":"Tobias Pehböck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7622565e0a200515c28e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3587031,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rui Mendes","original_name":"Rui Mendes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7620d3e2ec8009bc0380e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qDjWaaAGLV4FlCz8xS9KcyuhHWP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
