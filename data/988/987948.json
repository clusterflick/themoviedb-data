Food is only available through the government, and only to those holding a monthly-issued card. Joe Campanella plays a husband who finds himself in desperate straits when his ration card is rejected because it was in poor condition when received. Despite an official policy that no one in that society goes hungry, Campanella's character receives no help.","popularity":1.5297,"poster_path":"/4n7WiEamU5UAjJkS9bRateDRnCC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Then They Forgot God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Campanella","original_name":"Joseph Campanella","popularity":0.3745,"profile_path":"/o6A0IZkjcDNDVBTFCVLsdySz3w3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Arthur Thompson","credit_id":"6462a186e3fa2f016621d884","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Garland","original_name":"Beverly Garland","popularity":0.6814,"profile_path":"/xDrFCdQcbdqv22UoEddG7IyXF7A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vilma Thompson","credit_id":"6462a196e3fa2f0103a20763","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Seven","original_name":"Johnny Seven","popularity":0.3971,"profile_path":"/kn6k8OPk4OnAGl2aKp9zOBXfMyw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Ravitch","credit_id":"6462a1a4dbbb42013638067c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Morris","original_name":"Howard Morris","popularity":0.6213,"profile_path":"/nb50cjIZX1tBzXlXGWuzihKXgPB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Williams","credit_id":"6462a1b28c44b978071ea399","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelsea Brown","original_name":"Chelsea Brown","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/zx1n4HW8xqKxbrVrKoTiGtxb8IQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Wallach","credit_id":"6462a1c38c44b97808ff5354","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam West","original_name":"Adam West","popularity":1.2052,"profile_path":"/a3Yw8bb6AF7a8Zr7IyEZhZxWVWN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Collier","credit_id":"6462a1d00f36550153c75a7a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ging","original_name":"Jack Ging","popularity":0.5004,"profile_path":"/i7gZLiwbFVcxLpEP8lvudNpdkAs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Wolf","credit_id":"6462a1dc0f36550136a504fc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vince Howard","original_name":"Vince Howard","popularity":0.2024,"profile_path":"/evEagtsRD5l69rmSy9i51z1yuoP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Cheston","credit_id":"6462a1eca67254014367bd94","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Gregory","original_name":"Mary Gregory","popularity":0.3243,"profile_path":"/j02wWM62eM6ihph85XlXP88EVbl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Arlene Vikkers","credit_id":"6462a2008c44b978071ea3bc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bramley","original_name":"William Bramley","popularity":0.2751,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mr. Thatcher","credit_id":"6462a2118c44b9780cf556c0","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1878074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay King","original_name":"Fay King","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Barnes","credit_id":"6462a225a67254014367bda2","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943559,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Taylor Byars","original_name":"Taylor Byars","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462a26b8c44b9780cf556eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244193,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melvin Hersh","original_name":"Melvin Hersh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462a2908c44b9780af20e0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sy Salkowitz","original_name":"Sy Salkowitz","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462a23fef8b32011b14dc1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"S.
