Transferred to Manus Island Detention prison a month after his arrival on Australian shores by boat, Behrouz spent six years in detention. His reporting and writings from the Manus detention prison, using a smuggled mobile phone, brought to international notice the horrific reality of life for detainees. His book 'No Friend but the Mountainsâ€™ written while in detention on his mobile phone has become one of the most celebrated books in Australia in recent times, winning Australia's prestigious literary award, the 2019 Victorian Prize for Literature.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/uW06TRWeT5wh97ohr4sN7OlHLc6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of survival","title":"Behrouz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Behrouz Boochani","original_name":"Behrouz Boochani","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a9526ed5569718c6b5d949","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon V.
