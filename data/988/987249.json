Three concentration camps were situated just across the Slovenian-Italian border, and this is also where a new concentration camp - a detention center for migrants - was being built at the time of making this film. Further, the film discusses the issue of statelessness - by comparing everyday situations endured by the Roma people in Rome, Italy, and by the Erased people in Slovenia - they too were, and still often are, detained in Italian and Slovenian detention centers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dIIif5weI3Sa6iZp0swGqRu08D3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Other Side of the River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Dall'altra parte del fiume","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On the Other Side of the River","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3587053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Dembsky","original_name":"Helena Dembsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7680f7f6c8d77b97e8324","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3587054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Pignoni","original_name":"Roberto Pignoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7681805b54973b1b20e29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3587055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uršula Lipovec Čebron","original_name":"Uršula Lipovec Čebron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a768283d4d9617e96ab5c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dIIif5weI3Sa6iZp0swGqRu08D3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
