This video follows several men and women as they take us into the bush to look for leaves that they need for healing. We then follow then home where they explain and demonstrate their way of preparing the poultice or infusion. Narrated by the people themselves –and with beautiful songs about the importance of leaves woven throughout – this poetic film gives unique insight into the culture.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/WUmVoguEKhMKwQecFIXObSHVO6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breaking Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Kramer","original_name":"Karen Kramer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a6d4d9255dba0065273c95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176569","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/WUmVoguEKhMKwQecFIXObSHVO6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":889},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u5xpQliQEjsbgomvXletsXrUY78.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
