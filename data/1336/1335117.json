Their relationship is founded on a shared lie, a guilt that torments them both, and an unrelenting desire that threatens to consume them both. They married young, not knowing the depths of love or passion, but when they met, they knew they had found their soulmate. The characters Luís and Ana, played by Carla Chambel and Rúben Garcia, are united by a passion that lasts for several years, supported by furtive encounters, declarations of love, conflicts and guilt. The Waning Sky presents a poetic and lyrical narrative of the complexities of desire, love and the lingering pain of living with the consequences.","popularity":0.1203,"poster_path":"/qjiURKNYJUmeD4yJ3UZ9l5SxfPX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fronteira Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2024-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Waning Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Chambel","original_name":"Carla Chambel","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/vubI5HDAuL2DlTpkT0KOMV0tB2f.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"66c1c9a52edd55b4ee924dbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruben Garcia","original_name":"Ruben Garcia","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/i2BLX9cf0VVNJJ9VrRQZFUGNvbA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luís","credit_id":"66c1c9fa4b12fbe89cad7ce5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2121434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Almendra","original_name":"Pedro Almendra","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/waNurAbcAZthJ4fbB2LzMGIphKQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"João","credit_id":"66c1ca11214e2242e99233b9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Ruiz Carmona","original_name":"Carlos Ruiz Carmona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c1ca45af3e2b4c36ad7c92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Ruiz Carmona","original_name":"Carlos Ruiz Carmona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c1ca4f5f05ec0b2e9233f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892181,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joel Brandao","original_name":"Joel Brandao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c1ca6727424ecdbb6e1795","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2340704,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernardo Bourbon","original_name":"Bernardo Bourbon","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jcXcnqgyVkavrst5Fw32axmLGKZ.jpg","credit_id":"677051962c9097b266619057","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28626196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3CFwnGu8eN6dbaokvztMiWB6GiQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1013,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gDN6XLukpvGkpoj90QyDnnzp6py.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qjiURKNYJUmeD4yJ3UZ9l5SxfPX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/4KZtvUFrwMsw2pZN419fl1F3Jgm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Caminhos Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
