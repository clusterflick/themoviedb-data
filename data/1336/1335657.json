She makes her husband swear that he remarry after her death, but on one condition, that he only marry a woman more beautiful than her.  Seeing the picture of his daughter appear, whom he doesn't recognize at first, the king finds in her a woman more beautiful than the queen and he wishes to marry her, and continues to wish it even after she is recognized as his child.  Advised by her fairy godmother, the little girl imposes impossible conditions in hopes of cancelling the wedding. But the king accomplishes the impossible. The girl then asks of him the skin of his donkey, the one that makes the kingdom's riches by defecating gold. Without hesitating the king fulfills the request of his daughter, who then flees him, dressed in the horrible garment to repel all desires.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":"/csy7h2ZMo2lyAIEA2JO5RPKKVKo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donkey Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurélia Arto","original_name":"Aurélia Arto","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/5pbRE84iSBPT5m61OjyC8lLH9N6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Child Donkey Skin / The Queen Her Mother","credit_id":"66c20544b6e4d787c1d3490b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Dillon","original_name":"Hugo Dillon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The King Her Father","credit_id":"66c2057bb58d5cef0ad54666","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dianko Dianoué","original_name":"Dianko Dianoué","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Prince Her Lover","credit_id":"66c205c99aa8442fb444e2a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Sauger","original_name":"Christophe Sauger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Fairy Her Godmother","credit_id":"66c205db6bc895721644e2ba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4867511,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Michel Rabeux","original_name":"Jean-Michel Rabeux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c20431b15e099baf5d6ac0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892426,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Pierre-André Weitz","original_name":"Pierre-André Weitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c204714df29456bad0c127","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2666867,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Pierre-André Weitz","original_name":"Pierre-André Weitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c2048418e6622adcd34585","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2666867,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Pierre-André Weitz","original_name":"Pierre-André Weitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c2049ee53a7849e5d345ec","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4892428,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jean-Claude Fonkenel","original_name":"Jean-Claude Fonkenel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c204d0e03e4a2018d2f140","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/csy7h2ZMo2lyAIEA2JO5RPKKVKo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Teaser Peau d'âne de Jean-Michel Rabeux","key":"SLMg1agOMxY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-11-07T08:35:17.000Z","id":"66c20364baef72a0c4d2f11f"}]}}}
