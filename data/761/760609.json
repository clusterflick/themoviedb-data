A hypnotic nighttime travelling shot, filmed on a train heading toward a brightly lit city, introduces a collage alternating between shots of natural scenes and melancholy self-portraits. Displaying abdominal scars, partially concealed by a brideâ€™s veil, the protagonist is an enigmatic and disturbed figure with multiple identities. Echoing these preoccupations, the image itself is subdivided into multiple panes, each one bearing a multiplicity of possible meanings. With an impressive sense of plasticity, this film marks the arrival of a unique, self-assured voice.
