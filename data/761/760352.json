Because of its spacious parks and the large number of enthusiastically singing birds, Berlin is the best city to make music with nightingales. Almost everything one plays to a nightingale will encourage him to sing more. These encounters becomes a direct window into the unknown, a touch of communication with a being with whom we cannot speak. The play of pure tones jarring against click and buzz, it all becomes not a code but a groove, an amphitheater of rhythms in which we strive to find a place.","popularity":0.0727,"poster_path":"/fv8u77EgUxmiRiheDzIuMSMwbOd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Playart Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightingales in Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Rothenberg","original_name":"David Rothenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b0f41a5610035ede94f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cymin Samawatie","original_name":"Cymin Samawatie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b27f48e0d0039ec6674","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lembe Lokk","original_name":"Lembe Lokk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b39cb6db500362ef7c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Korhan Erel","original_name":"Korhan Erel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b482cff1800396fcb18","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benedicte Maurseth","original_name":"Benedicte Maurseth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b570e441900393fcf3d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wassim Mukdad","original_name":"Wassim Mukdad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b6d0e441900393fcf5c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2163929,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sanna Salmenkallio","original_name":"Sanna Salmenkallio","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b7ea097dc003a5a9596","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietmar Todt","original_name":"Dietmar Todt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b8e3a9650003bad2e31","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Roeske","original_name":"Tina Roeske","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa16b9d0c125500382744ee","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Rothenberg","original_name":"David Rothenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa16c48691cd50037cdfab5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842163,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Ehrnrooth","original_name":"Sophie Ehrnrooth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa16c78cb6db500372f8cdc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2065746,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ville Tanttu","original_name":"Ville Tanttu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd27dead18fb90041fabbcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fv8u77EgUxmiRiheDzIuMSMwbOd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nightingales in Berlin  t e a s e r","key":"191341487","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-21T08:48:00.000Z","id":"5fa169b896e30b003733ab2b"}]}}}
