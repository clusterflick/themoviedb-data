Both her character and technique have been affirmed and respected by the audience and peers. For a long time, Cindy has lived with countless praises and inexhaustible money. Although outsiders see her as a veritable success, in Cindy's heart, she always feels that there is a void that cannot be filled.\r By chance, Cindy met a dancer named Wang Li. Cindy was very surprised by Wang Li's talent in dancing, so she decided to cultivate this plastic talent well.
