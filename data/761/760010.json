Once, people came here to find freedom and fortune and to live in a vast and breathtaking mountain landscape, but years of intensive mining have inflicted immeasurable damage on the landscape.

We hear the memories and stories of the former mine workers, and of the original and current inhabitants of the area.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cEA8oCL2yxV2bTE42UsmEQcA6Xh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Lagier","original_name":"Leslie Lagier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e1a1c09fb003898667d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Lagier","original_name":"Leslie Lagier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e332ceb530038586009","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799109,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pali Meursault","original_name":"Pali Meursault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e636d4c97003886fb02","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799109,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pali Meursault","original_name":"Pali Meursault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e702ceb53003958ddd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Bentz","original_name":"Eric Bentz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e946d4c97003886fb17","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792789,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gilles Bénardeau","original_name":"Gilles Bénardeau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e83ede1b00037e643e7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Lagier","original_name":"Leslie Lagier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00e46f04d010034a3d2fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cEA8oCL2yxV2bTE42UsmEQcA6Xh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
