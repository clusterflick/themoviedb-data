Every four years since — aligned to the national election cycle — they’ve updated the collection to reflect the current moment, presenting the clips in chronological order, with no voice-over editorializing, a tour-de-force of witty and incisive editing. Consisting of rare as well as notorious footage, Political Advertisement argues for television’s enormous importance in selling the presidency — a force that transforms citizens into consumers, and the presidency into the ultimate product.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/zSNCxhtplUjMsadC00SQcVCpQu8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Political Advertisement X: 1952-2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Political Advertisement","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Political Advertisement X 1952-2020","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385091,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marshall Reese","original_name":"Marshall Reese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa312c4e267de003e3b642b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoni Muntadas","original_name":"Antoni Muntadas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa312bbecbde9003d68a6b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoni Muntadas","original_name":"Antoni Muntadas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa330dfc68b6900402b8f52","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385091,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marshall Reese","original_name":"Marshall Reese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa330e823d2780040f5eaa8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13387810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zSNCxhtplUjMsadC00SQcVCpQu8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sala X, Madrid","release_date":"2020-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Salt Beyoglu","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The J.
