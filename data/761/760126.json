Even those who are not passionate about the classical music recognize the famous Ode to Joy. Despite the grim context in which it was created, the 9th Symphony leaves us fascinated, moved and uplifted by its creativity, its power and its culmination in the Ode to Joy. More than 160 years after it was written, Beethoven’s hymn to brotherhood was adopted by the European Union as its official anthem. But Beethoven’s Ninth is also met with enthusiasm far beyond the borders of Europe. What’s the explanation for its never ending success? What is it about this work of art that fascinates people all over the world?","popularity":0.4892,"poster_path":"/hmDgXvR8T62YM3JhOLeVoz42G9g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95576,"logo_path":"/r3aDiyT6jM3ORrc5YaSH1600Ozk.png","name":"DW","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":107767,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sounding
