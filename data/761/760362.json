Mixing live-action with animated puppets and objects, Bowers helmed a score of little-known mini-masterpieces, many starring himself.  This exhaustive introduction to Bowersâ€™s oeuvre, over 2 hours of material, includes the shorts Egged On (1926), He Done His Best (1926), Fatal Footsteps (1926), Now You Tell One (1926), Many a Slip (1927), There It Is (1928), and It's a Bird (1930). With an introduction by filmmaker, distributor and archivist Serge Bromberg, founder and chairman of Lobster Films.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extraordinary World of Charley Bowers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
