Catalina Yagan, 89 years old, remembers the song of her grandfather Asenewensis. Her sons Victor and Roberto Vargas set out on a journey on horseback from the indigenous reserve they currently occupy, crossing the shores of the Onashaga channel in search of their ancestral reflection. Twakana means teaching, and through this story a connection with the ritual singing of Asenewensis is proposed. The Yaghan language travels through the raw nature and feeling of a living people.","popularity":0.0886,"poster_path":"/rSEDJRBxgEjCoyiBXHZ5c26GwBf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waia Films SRL","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twakana Yagan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Vargas Filgueira","original_name":"Victor Vargas Filgueira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa00f6e160e7300394441ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Vargas","original_name":"Roberto Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa00f752790bf0036482221","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Leonidas","original_name":"Ignacio Leonidas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00f865f2db1003929b91b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Tenuta","original_name":"Rodrigo Tenuta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00f947614210038f30669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Tenuta","original_name":"Rodrigo Tenuta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fa1f04d010036a58c26","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Leonidas","original_name":"Ignacio Leonidas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fab2ceb530038586118","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840670,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Maradona","original_name":"Andrea Maradona","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fb95f2db1003929b9a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pablo de Antueno","original_name":"Pablo de Antueno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fc8ede1b00036e51727","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Leonidas","original_name":"Ignacio Leonidas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fd37614210036f40790","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Tenuta","original_name":"Rodrigo Tenuta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fdf7e34830039a51cf9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Leonidas","original_name":"Ignacio Leonidas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00fec0cb335003660f635","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840673,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"José Pera","original_name":"José Pera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa00ffe2716710036764673","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16062718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y3hvxFhDI8XMWvdbRVfthaWXPZZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXoU24nXn7TGEqT57mZl2X43Mh0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1861,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rSEDJRBxgEjCoyiBXHZ5c26GwBf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1316}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" Festival Internacional de Cine de Viña del Mar","release_date":"2020-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Twakana Yagan - Trailer","key":"403760229","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-03T16:48:05.000Z","id":"5fa013767614210035f3983f"}]}}}
