However, this did not come to pass as Junya did not share the same family name and he grew estranged from his family over time. To escape this tension, Junya ventured overseas to pursue other dreams and distanced himself from the hometown where he grew up. One day, while working in an izakaya, he meets a foreigner with the same birthday researching a new dance piece for a film. His fateful encounter leads him to confront a family history that he has left behind and gives the dancer inspiration for her work. Together in the midst of winter, they revisit Junya's hometown to reconnect with his childhood and let go of a promise he cannot fulfil.","popularity":0.1261,"poster_path":"/hBITFORGeiEBSn4Wgo6bw7881wR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faraway My Shadow Wandered","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3011653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sudhee Liao","original_name":"Sudhee Liao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f40951d820f00281cf6e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348377,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liao Jiekai","original_name":"Liao Jiekai","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/tDgYEaSSvDIGlzQGFlE7zpnXn8K.jpg","credit_id":"5fa194448d77c40039ab5095","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2565239,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shaun Neo","original_name":"Shaun Neo","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc27175420228003dc05d6f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14063902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jTcXHpm41NgISqIXqE2MckLH1O5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5zpGsAmgzQF2cV0I7bWCgJcDCy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hRuw0AINtuXAMsEuj5ZMo0uXTe8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hBITFORGeiEBSn4Wgo6bw7881wR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Singapore International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Faraway My Shadow Wandered Trailer | SGIFF 2020","key":"N6-RfXRkGF8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-18T05:17:09.000Z","id":"5fb4bb1e3a48c5003c837e04"}]}}}
