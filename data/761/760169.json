Americans are at loggerheads over the odyssey of the Joad family, tenant farmers from Oklahoma who, like thousands of others, were driven from their land during the Great Depression. Eighty years have passed since the famous work was published, and 90 years since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. To mark this occasion, the documentary examines the genesis of the novel, its themes, its renewed reception during the financial crisis of 2008.","popularity":0.4055,"poster_path":"/yD43sEZI4WLfeVP0fihVZbJDjvm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat
