Full Moon's notorious \"coronaverse\" expands anew in BARBIE & KENDRA STORM AREA 51, the third (but not final!) movie in the world's only quarantine set and shot film franchise. Get ready for a heady dose of pandemic panic as the dynamic duo (played once more by Cody Renee Cameron and Robin Sydney) turn on the TV and get tuned into a viral saga that takes them deep into the forbidden fortress of Area 51 and beyond!  Combining insanely funny new footage with hilariously re-dubbed retro sci-fi cinema awesomeness, BARBIE & KENDRA STORM AREA 51 is the wackiest \"coronasploitation\" comedy
