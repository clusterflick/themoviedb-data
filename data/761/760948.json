He arrives to Beirut with a condition that had been affecting his eyes and causes him to go straight into surgery, temporarily blinding him with patches covering his eyes. He uses the healing time to reflect, write and spend time with his family. The filmmaker then begins to visit the blind institute where he will conduct his research and attempts to cast someone to play himself in parallel, which doesn't go as planned. Little does the institute know that Karim has no treatment to pitch but continues to visit the classrooms and attend in order to find his characters.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/e3Bx0Kkw0imCfr7FcQJ8jwn2cX1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changing Film
