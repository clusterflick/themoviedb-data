Written by the renowned scholar Jonathan Bate, and taking its cue from Jacques’ famous ‘Seven Ages of Man’ speech in As You Like It, the drama traces Shakespeare’s life from his birth in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 to his burial there fifty-two years later. Weaving together this story with extracts from many of Shakespeare’s most famous plays, Simon Callow presents a vivid and very human portrait of the man and of the Elizabethan world in which he lived.  Recorded before an audience during the play’s triumphant London run, Being Shakespeare is both a wonderful introduction to the author and a richly nuanced, funny and fascinating study for those who already love his plays.","popularity":0.2542,"poster_path":"/uAYLfddfNMzMqJQmHEgwWhNLvva.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Shakespeare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Callow","original_name":"Simon Callow","popularity":0.8836,"profile_path":"/no6qlnMrWeUzSt1FjD2Vf9x992e.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa0834063501300315c7c56","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27903,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Freeman","original_name":"David Freeman","popularity":0.1639,"profile_path":"/lmGZ6v9vHrzvRBEzW2dvhMO06Q8.jpg","credit_id":"660c861f35818f016239d94c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Bate","original_name":"Jonathan Bate","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa0d7a53a9650003bac66e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wyver","original_name":"John Wyver","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":"/yHuOcIl8fCdfpHJlkEHT85cnssX.jpg","credit_id":"5fa0d7cbf48e0d0037ebb70c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2098635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r0oW9nqXTU42sD0xk1zhu0qlO2A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1366,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uAYLfddfNMzMqJQmHEgwWhNLvva.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":911},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sAw5CfiPRYUbKn3oSsPYC4SVIvO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Ingles\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"Inglés\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
