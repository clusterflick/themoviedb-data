Better known as The Elephant Man, he produced a little noticed two-page autobiography, sold to those attending a freak show in which he was displayed, opposite the royal London hospital in London's Whitechapel High Street.  There is one surviving copy of the pamphlet. Its text is coupled with starkly filmed sequences of a model church he also constructed, now hermetically sealed within a glass and ebony container, together forming the basis for this poignant, silent film. A reminder of Merrick’s profound humanity in the face of extreme adversity, it also serves as an auto-biographical footnote and reminder of David Lynch’s eponymous feature film on Merrick, in which the model is a central motif and metaphor for his psychological and emotional fluctuations.","popularity":0.1131,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I First Saw the Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1370864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Warnell","original_name":"Phillip Warnell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa1c6d4691cd50037ce69f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1370864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Warnell","original_name":"Phillip Warnell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa1c72d691cd50038cf26af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Rivers","original_name":"Ben Rivers","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/4WUVJwo0o5nE63xROHGRcSJ7O1T.jpg","credit_id":"5fa1c6ed5a99150038fdb91d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Raedeker","original_name":"David Raedeker","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/iJ2H6wnAQJndLydvbHGDqaZrFDk.jpg","credit_id":"5fa1c71c67825900369fd2ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3466786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2012-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
