Coaxed by his father, El Khatib decides to make the journey from Orléans to Tangier. Structured like a road movie, Renault 12 is also the filmmaker’s quest to discover his own origins, in which he both documents chance encounters and stages situations to bring social, political, and cultural landscapes to light.","popularity":0.2546,"poster_path":"/c3ia369ABNJXAzg4AYKKVtMVUng.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Renault 12","video":true,"vote_average":7.625,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2274856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed El Khatib","original_name":"Mohamed El Khatib","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/n6dwGUVsRxfalf1JbOAO6PPZXtz.jpg","credit_id":"6658df8a2c7537f5811d2086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/RuXpHQa12VnAtVwtGuycWBBu25.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/c3ia369ABNJXAzg4AYKKVtMVUng.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":706},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jCiNo2ldk2nIZ1gky0pTMZtSZ7r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195239,"name":"travelogue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
