Murray: Writing in Unknown Tongues","overview":"John Bunion (J. B.) Murray (1908-1988) was a farmer who lived in rural Glascock County, Georgia, near the community of Mitchel. When he was approximately seventy years of age, believing he had experienced a vision from God, he began writing a non discursive script on adding machine tape, wall board, and stationery. He described it as \"the language of the Holy Spirit, direct from God\" and interpreted it using a bottle of water as a focusing device. In the last ten years of his life he made over a thousand paintings, introducing the script into fields of color and adding figures that represent \"the evil people; the ones that are dry tongued, the one's that don't know God\". Murray's works are exhibited throughout the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eTIgvclLsdu6fbkY4KPmYifRZzz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J.B.
