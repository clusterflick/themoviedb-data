Moni is willing to do anything possible to find the attacker and to protect her sister. But is that really what Silke (34) wants? And if so, who is actually the one, to be protected? And above all, protect from who? And which role does the offender René (38) play, who doesn't even understand why he did it. A melancholic film that plays with three different perspectives and constantly reinvents itself while searching for answers.","popularity":0.5223,"poster_path":"/aEeGPQykJICqen9iABNkjjkaakp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151482,"logo_path":"/2foeGkDgiVfJGpYw9N0gn9Zt3qv.png","name":"Contando
