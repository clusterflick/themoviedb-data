He treats the war in a brilliant and sarcastic way, evokes his seduction. Mark Bennett's score is itself provocative, languorous, and close to a waltz. The whole thing is a series of songs cast in the mode of melodrama, that is to say music in tandem with a narration. My contribution lies in the superimposition of war scenes, coupled with what I called an image of Gabriel: a young and handsome soldier, a personification of the good warrior, a protective image. He gives off strong impressions throughout the duration of the film. She makes him appear sometimes active and aggressive, sometimes asleep or beckoning. The film uses footage from the Vietnam War and World War II. They show soldiers marching, tanks rolling. Explosions reveal in passing our dear “Gabriel”.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/2By5ofM83j0xgHUgzd4TbcPVtlf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Songs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence F.
