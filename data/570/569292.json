Taking the dot as an elementary unit is not a coincidence if we think that the notion of pixels with video images began to occupy people's minds in the 70â€™s, decades before the arrival of giant led screens. [...] 9, and then 16 screens within one same screen allow an impressive process of simultaneous abstract sequences. The film partition shows a combinatorial process between monochrome colours in the background and pointillist compositions in the foreground. As many sequences as screens; each one is a reflection on abstract images: pointillism, geometrism, \"nuagisme\" or informal abstraction , are all nods to the history of abstraction in painting: Vassili Kandinsky, Paul Klee, or Augusto Giacometti seem to have been called together within a mondrianesque grid.
