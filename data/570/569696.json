Faced with the threat of violence, loneliness, the lack of financial resources or information about services, the victim is often understandably reluctant to seek help. Emphasizing the importance for women of speaking out, the film also points out the role of the transition house in putting victims of abuse in touch with appropriate legal and social services.","popularity":0.4858,"poster_path":"/v2G3XQG1oiIGLdIQlGt2Q3mG9ST.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio D (NFB)","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sylvie's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Next Step: Sylvie's Story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Dressel","original_name":"Holly Dressel","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5c1b1200c3a3680b4a872c0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Magny","original_name":"Michèle Magny","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61d0fb2ff9a3fb0042b10bac","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691690,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zoe Dirse","original_name":"Zoe Dirse","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d0fb0f4ca67600664b8bc7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1639600,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kathleen Shannon","original_name":"Kathleen Shannon","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410d952fe6c180084e88a2f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2514086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norma Denys","original_name":"Norma Denys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410d95aede1b028635cbc53","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":75008,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jackie Newell","original_name":"Jackie Newell","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410d966e18e3f07b4246999","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Peter Strobl","original_name":"Hans Peter Strobl","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410d96dede1b028e84d14fd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Judith Gruber-Stitzer","original_name":"Judith Gruber-Stitzer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6410d974176a9400f3c2f8b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Horne","original_name":"Tina Horne","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1b11e8c3a3680b50872908","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198528,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerry Rodgers","original_name":"Gerry Rodgers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1b12139251414b03535a27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Horne","original_name":"Tina Horne","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1b121c0e0a265f6555e4de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198529,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sidonie Kerr","original_name":"Sidonie Kerr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1b124ac3a3680b5087296a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0237737","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v2G3XQG1oiIGLdIQlGt2Q3mG9ST.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6719,"name":"montreal, canada"},{"id":167696,"name":"healing"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":207691,"name":"abuse"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
