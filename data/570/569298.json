Matisse painted a curious picture Door-Window in Collioure.\r Homage to Collioure, nod to the cubists, reference to Matisse; offering to the wind and to the sea.\r The furious Tramontana sends you in spasms its rumblings in the air which has become crystalline. The sea rages under the effect of the wind, which suddenly desert the various small boats; SOS for the unwary. Large breaking waves delight children on the beach.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/j57LhMusbu4Me2VpbglVTx8yyH0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vagues à Collioure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2122795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","original_name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1880340e0a26038b3ec555","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j57LhMusbu4Me2VpbglVTx8yyH0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Scratch projection","release_date":"1991-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
