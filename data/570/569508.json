How far can you go? How fast? Whatâ€™s it like to go three days without food and companionship? To run 15 miles, to climb a 14,000 foot mountain, to navigate in dense forest or open ocean, to rappel down a vertical cliff, or sleep in the snow?

The film is fast paced with intentional disregard for time and space continuity. The students tell the story.","popularity":0.1061,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summit Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outward Bound","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fulton","original_name":"Robert Fulton","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/dyzMR7dtY5fyoyccAVfcoiqN4np.jpg","credit_id":"6630479c2a210c0125e1cc39","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fulton","original_name":"Robert Fulton","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/dyzMR7dtY5fyoyccAVfcoiqN4np.jpg","credit_id":"5c412e36c3a368638a42f402","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220200,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joern Gerdts","original_name":"Joern Gerdts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c412e4d0e0a2654c1933b66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428838,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Trautvetter","original_name":"Bill Trautvetter","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c412e98c3a3684c543c1503","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Dyhrenfurth","original_name":"Norman Dyhrenfurth","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c412e830e0a26386792fd52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalie Maxwell","original_name":"Natalie Maxwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c412eac0e0a2646a292ac28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2188031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger C.
