Having left the village to pursue a formal education at Cambridge School of Art at just 16, and begin a life and career that would see him travel all over the world; performing with and meeting his Bluegrass Heroes - the likes of Bill Monroe, Hank Williams, Dolly Parton. Old Suffolk Boys provides an insight into an area of Eastern England, as well as a man who is returning to his roots - entrenched with pickup trucks, a dash of conservative politics and a deep-rooted love of country music, that will surely resonate with audiences.","popularity":0.109,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29116,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Westminster","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"John Holder returns to the village he grew up, Badwell Ash, reconnecting with family and friends from the past and encountering stories - of growing up and growing old in Suffolk, as well as ones of mischief, intrigue and of history.","title":"Old Suffolk Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flow West","original_name":"Flow West","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1a27670e0a2657aa1c3db1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Holder","original_name":"Louis Holder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1a2770c3a3683464d01391","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2009330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Antonio Liptaj","original_name":"Mario Antonio Liptaj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1a2780c3a368344ed01468","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristof Szenasi","original_name":"Kristof Szenasi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1a278c0e0a2657b11c4047","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9105682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
