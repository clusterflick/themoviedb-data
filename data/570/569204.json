On the one hand, the Seine's sparkling, the Alexandre III bridge's sculptures and the majestic stairs descents of a mysterious personage ; on the other hand, the brilliance of a mirror reveals a lascivious inner space, invaded by art works, strange objects, tropical plants, heavy clothes, in the middle of which sit enthroned the Aesthete contemplating male nudes photos. The crystalline voice of a counter-tenor celebrating Bach perfects the voluptuous feeling emerging from this movie.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les métaphores d'Alex","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2197430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Cissokho","original_name":"Alexandre Cissokho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1819f2c3a36866c338bf4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Mazé","original_name":"Marcel Mazé","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1819f8c3a36866d838d79c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965427,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berndt Deprez","original_name":"Berndt Deprez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c181a290e0a2603753e7863","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marti","original_name":"Stéphane Marti","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/goQU4fcq4kFed6jfkioPKbcdpk6.jpg","credit_id":"5c181a0b92514132c90c80b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2197430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Cissokho","original_name":"Alexandre Cissokho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c181a1b92514132c30c907f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0385892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
