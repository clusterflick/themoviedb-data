Tarenskeen and Bakker had started The Meteors in 1977 and Michel van Dijk had recorded a record with Rinus Gerritsen from Golden Earring . However, Alquin slowly gained cult status and the call for a reunion in the compact disc era continued. A concert in Delft followed in 1995 , followed by a number of concerts in 1996. In 2003 Alquin regained a foothold on the pop stages, which resulted in a performance at Cultuurpodium Boerderij in Zoetermeer, which was recorded on both CD and DVD . The more definitive character of this reunion was evidenced by the fact that a new song was also released: Sweet Surrender by Bakker, Tarenskeen and Van Dijk. However, One More Night failed to chart in the Album Top 100 .","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/rPJaeAfmTOaQELKu6L5N7KOD6Dd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185064,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Van Video & Audio Mob","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2003-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alquin: One More Night","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdinand Bakker","original_name":"Ferdinand Bakker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"gitaar, zang","credit_id":"5c1cccecc3a368510aec2022","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel van Dijk","original_name":"Michel van Dijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"zang","credit_id":"5c1ccd0e92514127da4e4788","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Franssen","original_name":"Dick Franssen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hammondorgel, piano","credit_id":"5c1ccd2ac3a368510aec204c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Ottenhoff","original_name":"Rob Ottenhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"saxofoons","credit_id":"5c1ccd450e0a26102ae32fe9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Job Tarenskeen","original_name":"Job Tarenskeen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"slagwerk en percussie, zang","credit_id":"5c1ccd650e0a26102ae33002","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frans Koenn","original_name":"Frans Koenn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"basgitaar","credit_id":"5c1ccd81c3a3685128ec21de","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Page","original_name":"Monica Page","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"achtergrondzang","credit_id":"5c1ccda70e0a26102ae33030","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trudie van Starrenburg","original_name":"Trudie van Starrenburg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"achtergrondzang","credit_id":"5c1ccdc20e0a261031e32479","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1462307,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Schuurman","original_name":"Paul Schuurman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ae2fe35c30a00810f3b2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3760517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaap Poot","original_name":"Jaap Poot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ae31795c0af0098f64bbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2lIiGsrxALULphS1mygJQe3W2mt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rPJaeAfmTOaQELKu6L5N7KOD6Dd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
