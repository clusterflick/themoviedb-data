His guitar almost never has the six strings, his hands are dirty, his mind long ago could not stand the life that he had to live, and he continues as he can stuck to that guitar with which he expresses himself continuously, indefatigable. That vagabond, an omnipresent street artist, is the \"Niño Miguel\", considered by many to be the best guitarist in the history of flamenco, a genius who revolutionized the guitar with only two records in the 70s, a source of inspiration for all other guitarists... a guitarist of guitarists, a living legend, a mystery, a misunderstood genius, excluded from society: The shadow of the strings.","popularity":0.2738,"poster_path":"/8Q5lZmQx00uQR0H6HEZUcN8Amth.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anabenche","origin_country":""},{"id":112444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universidad
