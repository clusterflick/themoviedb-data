The city and its surrounding area have one of the highest cancer rates in the country, and a history of health outcomes split along color lines. Braddock (population: less than 2,000) is also home to people who are determined to stick around and improve their lives and the lives of their neighbors. In this powerful new documentary series, we meet an activist, a filmmaker, a farmer, and a politician fighting to bring their town back from the brink.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/adtFfyPawaKRNr8WD0YpzyAlTcg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Braddock, PA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2198897,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrea González Mereles","original_name":"Andrea González Mereles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a96a48bbd0b000508264d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094285,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erick Del Aguila","original_name":"Erick Del Aguila","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a96a64bbd0b00066041b63","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1966591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ro Haber","original_name":"Ro Haber","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/wsPWjRSXTgsynvJgIXWnaixs9Ay.jpg","credit_id":"5c1c2ad40e0a2644c69a885b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/adtFfyPawaKRNr8WD0YpzyAlTcg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
