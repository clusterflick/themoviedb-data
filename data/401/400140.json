Puerto Rico is losing confidence in its political parties that for years took over loyal fanatics. The people elected with its eyes closed their first independent governor in the country’s history only to have his corrupted regime overthrown by rebels. The country has revolved. Added to this chaos is the fact that a mysterious virus, which has taken over our water supply from rivers and lakes, has infected a large portion of the citizens with symptoms like skin deterioration, extreme sensibility to sounds, and, in a matter of days, death.","popularity":0.2394,"poster_path":"/iHvN2bOsFcCpkaJy0ffdPwkIv7N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trebol
