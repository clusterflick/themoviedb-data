During her visit to his palace, she has a bomb planted in a bouquet of roses that she has ordered for the king.  Only at the last second, when she can no longer resist his charms, does she discreetly defuse the bomb.  Their almost-explosive love affair blossoms.","popularity":0.4224,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77741,"logo_path":null,"name":"Operetta Archives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Little King","title":"The Little King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der kleine König","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Sturdevant","original_name":"Clark Sturdevant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"The King","credit_id":"5753053492514117e200004d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Olglesby","original_name":"Christopher Olglesby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Field Marshall General Lincoln","credit_id":"575305619251410d14000ff0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Neer","original_name":"Daniel Neer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Admiral Montbrison","credit_id":"57530578c3a3684b6a0005f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayson Lebaron","original_name":"Jayson Lebaron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chief of Police","credit_id":"5753058992514108d9000241","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lucas","original_name":"Michael Lucas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lord Chamberlain","credit_id":"575305ba92514117e200006f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Brian","original_name":"Nathan Brian","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Colonel","credit_id":"575305cac3a368707500025a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aidan Smerud","original_name":"Aidan Smerud","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lieutenant","credit_id":"575305e4925141061f000276","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Faulk","original_name":"Stephen Faulk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lt.
