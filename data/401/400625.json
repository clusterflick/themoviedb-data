But the summits reached are not points of arrival, they are intermediate stages which then push him on a journey around the world, in search of himself. His exploration, starting from the vertical walls, then moved towards horizontal paths and was always expressed towards the interior space where our fears and our desires reside. Where the man, sitting alone in front of himself, must decide to surpass himself or to adapt. And Walter never complied with them, he wrote his own rules and followed them all his life, allowing himself no loopholes or shortcuts. He built himself as a mountaineer, as an explorer, as a photojournalist and as a writer, but always and only with the intention of being an uncompromising man with his hands, his muscles, his heart and his head.","popularity":0.6812,"poster_path":"/o9VIciDPOP3xd8q47Qp3Y1CksTY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195769,"logo_path":"/ouGt3dYetuqUTH2JVvIjFHl02Hm.png","name":"Road Television","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walter Bonatti, King of the Alps","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Walter Bonatti – Con i muscoli, con il cuore, con la testa’","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Walter Bonatti, King of the Alps","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Walter Bonatti, Roi Des Alpes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Bonatti","original_name":"Walter Bonatti","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xW8Iu7zcNYtg3TBhZa1NgFmvsws.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6437da11ab684900e01ad186","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhold Messner","original_name":"Reinhold Messner","popularity":0.2707,"profile_path":"/vX0iOTrdmUnnOeXOYXpEcWu2f46.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reinhold Messner","credit_id":"5757eb60c3a3687d7c000e67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nando Nusdeo","original_name":"Nando Nusdeo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nando Nusdeo","credit_id":"5757ec629251413076000e8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Clavel","original_name":"Arnaud Clavel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Arnaud Clavel","credit_id":"5757ec97925141307b000e1e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Zanzi","original_name":"Luigi Zanzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Luigi Zanzi","credit_id":"5757ecbdc3a3687d67000e35","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632358,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fabio Pagani","original_name":"Fabio Pagani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5757eba1c3a3687d6a000e71","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632359,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chiara Ronchini","original_name":"Chiara Ronchini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5757ebd3925141306d000e9e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632363,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maurizio Carta","original_name":"Maurizio Carta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5757ec029251413079000de4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Imperio","original_name":"Michele Imperio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57517ea0c3a36837720024a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4273884","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/orGZnifNRxQ7h3Lg6I30q4T3yzx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pSzvsPrJP3ltIYkhivMKn2gDV0f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mrWMCb9EjP512CY9b1y9Axngdms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/srBb3KswlNFPXR1rqUw0X7PCsHY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1923,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o9VIciDPOP3xd8q47Qp3Y1CksTY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":3754,"name":"legend"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":301494,"name":"walter bonatti"},{"id":307583,"name":"goat climber"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
