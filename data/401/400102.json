After a serious car crash in 1989, he ended up on a wheelchair. He was 23 years old at the time. After a year of rehabilitation, he returned to the stage. Excelling in “Flowers for Algernon”, he continuously acts in the production in front of sell-out crowds across the country. He also lives his personal life, experiencing new loves and breakups, is engaged in civic affairs and returns to the hospital now and then. The film aims to give a non-pathetic image of a life lived to the full despite adversity.","popularity":0.2698,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":219047,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nadace Člověk a čas","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1999-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Potměšil","original_name":"Jan Potměšil","popularity":0.1872,"profile_path":"/u0xlHJou3WVnGRqy3oBoq4KS6Q2.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"574c4de0c3a3683c36000011","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jakub Špalek","original_name":"Jakub Špalek","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/bK5rFEMCOC9nVlWRsi0LxlsDH7K.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b0f3352fe2fa01723cd825","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Třeštíková","original_name":"Helena Třeštíková","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/fNNLoEjLdlrR14jomj0W16yUY34.jpg","credit_id":"65b0f2e03c43440151660be1","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2337731,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Třeštík","original_name":"Michael Třeštík","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b0f2eab9a0bd017244e30f","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1752624,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alena Müllerová","original_name":"Alena Müllerová","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b0f2f38c3159013931f04f","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596062,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pavel Dvořák","original_name":"Pavel Dvořák","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b0f3072fe2fa01723cd7f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4495984,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zuzana Červenková","original_name":"Zuzana Červenková","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b0f316b9a0bd019344fdae","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Třeštíková","original_name":"Helena Třeštíková","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/fNNLoEjLdlrR14jomj0W16yUY34.jpg","credit_id":"574c4df29251410eea000020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Třeštíková","original_name":"Helena Třeštíková","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/fNNLoEjLdlrR14jomj0W16yUY34.jpg","credit_id":"574c4e009251410ef5000010","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349099,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ervín Sanders","original_name":"Ervín Sanders","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574c4e269251410ef5000016","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1628545,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Josef Nekvasil","original_name":"Josef Nekvasil","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574c4e349251410eec000026","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1628544,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kristián Hynek","original_name":"Kristián Hynek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574c4e3dc3a3683c3a000013","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1628541,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Kubala","original_name":"Martin Kubala","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574c4e489251410eec00002a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350620,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zdenek Patočka","original_name":"Zdenek Patočka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574c4e5e9251410efc000020","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q104895214","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":306437,"name":"time-collecting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"1999-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
