A love triangle between Arturo (a Puritan), Riccardo (a Royalist) and the beautiful Elvira results in a drama of escapes, disguises and captures, during which Elvira loses her reason, before a final pardon restores her senses and unites her with her beloved Arturo.  The lead tenor role is notoriously difficult and Juan Diego Flórez shows no strain or difficulty throughout the role. Opera fans will undoubtedly be impressed with the overall production and the tenor's performance in particular.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/rqYfFwj5XFfi0zuGPwcxcC0oyDQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Florez and Machaidze rule!!","title":"Bellini I Puritani","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":268115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Diego Flórez","original_name":"Juan Diego Flórez","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/5C27Cvb0Pvv1Nm8bmKy4T8SWzWI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lord Arturo Talbo","credit_id":"57522bf49251414c5a00084c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1559062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Machaidze","original_name":"Nino Machaidze","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/a2eVh4msA8qak62NZXpZ8d0CApA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elvira","credit_id":"57522c129251414c4700084e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildebrando d'Arcangelo","original_name":"Ildebrando d'Arcangelo","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/s0IZIgj2wNSlTxmDYCbeWTE1jqL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sir Giorgio Valton","credit_id":"57522c349251414c5d0007df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ugo Guagliardo","original_name":"Ugo Guagliardo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lord Gualtiero Valton","credit_id":"57522c549251414c47000869","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Viviani","original_name":"Gabriele Viviani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/73KgtXrWUHIhLIjCbpNjX5zUOcs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sir Riccardo Forth","credit_id":"57522c73c3a368520c00082d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianluca Floris","original_name":"Gianluca Floris","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sir Bruno Roberton","credit_id":"57522c8fc3a368521b000808","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Pirazzini","original_name":"Nadia Pirazzini","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Enrichettta di Francia","credit_id":"57522caec3a36852100008a8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Mariotti","original_name":"Michele Mariotti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"57522ce29251414c5a00088a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier' Alli","original_name":"Pier' Alli","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57522e85c3a3685210000937","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincenzo Bellini","original_name":"Vincenzo Bellini","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/lpZpCuv3Qrm6m9ilagBpmil4mDz.jpg","credit_id":"57522e9c9251414c5a000901","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Bevilacqua","original_name":"Andrea Bevilacqua","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57522ebb9251414c4c000890","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rqYfFwj5XFfi0zuGPwcxcC0oyDQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
