Through grandly composed images, rhythmic editing, and aestheticized details, the director demonstrates his admiration for the interwar avant-garde. The film is a celebration of the new, while at the same time showing a traditional way of life and calling attention to working conditions; it is a refrain-like evocation of an arid country that explores the difficult lot of Syria’s rural inhabitants.","popularity":0.1715,"poster_path":"/1X438eexkG1PZfCLadacFy4XiA4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syrian Arab Television","origin_country":"SY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film-Essay on the Euphrates Dam","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","title":"Film-Muhawalah 'An Sadd al-Furat","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omar Amiralay","original_name":"Omar Amiralay","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/8Fn3s1W6LKSwTNfUeLKekn5mbqP.jpg","credit_id":"5750c768c3a3682f3300003d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omar Amiralay","original_name":"Omar Amiralay","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/8Fn3s1W6LKSwTNfUeLKekn5mbqP.jpg","credit_id":"5750c75f9251412b0f000049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29711707","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bM7hh9OgqS8X5nWdeK8P1oR3RvR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1X438eexkG1PZfCLadacFy4XiA4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":539,"name":"middle east"},{"id":9862,"name":"dam"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
