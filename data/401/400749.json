Robards. Upon winning the prominent position as judge, Ms. Madison finds herself walking a political tight rope with enemies all around doing what they can to cause her down fall.  Judge Madison convicts a murderer to death paving the way for her to be easily elected as the first female Governor.  As Governor she is faced with a difficult dilemma. She has the power to pardon her husband who has been convicted of a serious crime, but to do so she’d be using her office for her own personal gain. “I must find some way to realize my ideals without sacrificing my husband. I must struggle on somehow for the sake of womanhood!”","popularity":0.5312,"poster_path":"/6cc3hVAmpjwHT3U1MCr0362G44f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plymouth Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers of Men","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Every Woman's Problem","type":"Re-Release"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Clara Madison","credit_id":"5752f2eac3a36817de0025e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willis Robards","original_name":"Willis Robards","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/nb7G4EOZy0i1IBZVcza41JeW2fU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Worthington Williams","credit_id":"5752f2f89251414c5d002e99","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Reid","original_name":"Hal Reid","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":"/whvJPsWDZGlmw6peaHP7hQKTghm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jack Scranton","credit_id":"5752f30892514166f5002c0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":959266,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Arthur Tavares","original_name":"Arthur Tavares","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Giuseppe","credit_id":"57f2fa37c3a3683345003efb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Bennett","original_name":"Billie Bennett","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/io568sRaJJC2iZnbRPeboY1Spyb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Undetermined Role","credit_id":"57f2fa44c3a3683345003f05","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcella Russell","original_name":"Marcella Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Undetermined Role","credit_id":"57f2fa509251410c31003f3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":180844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Griffith","original_name":"Katherine Griffith","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/rxMJvezhqhltjgEeNU0xBzhL2DT.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Maida","credit_id":"618add121c6aa700897ae6b2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002959,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter Lundin","original_name":"Walter Lundin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5752f3cb925141187e002080","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willis Robards","original_name":"Willis Robards","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/nb7G4EOZy0i1IBZVcza41JeW2fU.jpg","credit_id":"5752f3ae9251414c5d002eca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Reid","original_name":"Hal Reid","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":"/whvJPsWDZGlmw6peaHP7hQKTghm.jpg","credit_id":"5752f3bc9251414c5d002ecd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008329","wikidata_id":"Q67697320","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1298,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5s3BkZNlbt0amFTNY9SyrcUz5y2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2306}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6cc3hVAmpjwHT3U1MCr0362G44f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15246,"name":"sabotage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mothers of Men (1917) Trailer","key":"Ikw5XWXKCvw","published_at":"2016-08-24T16:33:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57f2f9f09251410c22003d03"}]}}}
