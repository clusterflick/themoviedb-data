Kellerâ€™s montage grazes the sublime mystery of feeling at home.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Parts","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marjorie Keller","original_name":"Marjorie Keller","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/8B2jjQ1lXe1U5d34VetWNKdMxAk.jpg","credit_id":"574d289e925141107f00075c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cFw5n18R5akpA76qhVzOYnPAQ0D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1988-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
