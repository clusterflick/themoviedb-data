Singers are generally well chosen and perform admirably. However, at this point, slight reservations creep in; although Janowitz (Fidelio/Leonore) and Kollo (Florestan) look \"good\" and act well, the singing parts tax them a bit when pushed to the limit. Most of the time that doesn't matter, and an argument can be made that a little vocal strain is in character with their dire plight. Ideally, for me, Vickers as Florestan would have added extra vocal heft and more sensitive acting than Kollo.","popularity":0.3302,"poster_path":"/n3f8zr6t805pH27KulvYrOjK1Wl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pretty darn close to having","title":"Beethoven Fidelio","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gundula Janowitz","original_name":"Gundula Janowitz","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/g8LFdzMOoMpNeCZExyLgBDsBmBr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Leonora","credit_id":"5750f0019251411a6c000bff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Kollo","original_name":"René Kollo","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/zUi9xsOeYwzEAXl8vlNG26BcRvg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Florestan","credit_id":"5750f0229251410885000ed6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Jungwirth","original_name":"Manfred Jungwirth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rocco","credit_id":"5750f0429251411174000caf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Sotin","original_name":"Hans Sotin","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":"/fjlkAstdGHYPBBIDYbvo4f0M1fl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Don Pizarro","credit_id":"5750f0669251411a6c000c13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Popp","original_name":"Lucia Popp","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/2fBlAH3CT0rjhyQLHEQyqqTarQA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marzelline","credit_id":"5750f081c3a36852c1000552","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Dallapozza","original_name":"Adolf Dallapozza","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jaquino","credit_id":"5750f0a49251411a6c000c23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Helm","original_name":"Hans Helm","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fernando","credit_id":"5750f0bec3a36852c100055e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Terkal","original_name":"Karl Terkal","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"1er Gefangener","credit_id":"5750f0df92514146b50004f3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Šramek","original_name":"Alfred Šramek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uV8xHCOY4z6dLYWP1OaSn6B88UT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"2e Gefangener","credit_id":"5750f0fac3a36852c100056b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5750f1199251410885000f1f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","original_name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff3688021118f003f284095","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Schenk","original_name":"Otto Schenk","popularity":0.2738,"profile_path":"/9Xw1Sdl6oIKLHsHT4jyJ1lMeF4g.jpg","credit_id":"5750f13b925141088c000e0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0260025","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n3f8zr6t805pH27KulvYrOjK1Wl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1978-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
