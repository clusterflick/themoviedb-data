The combination of these activities helps Cynthia to solve the puzzle of self-discovery. Cynthia is confronted with a distorted mirror image that slips between the grotesque and the exotic, depending on her posture. While Cynthia performs her nose-pore cleaning routine in front of the mirror, a sphinx appears and sings a song from the animated movie \"The Last Unicorn,\" which laments becoming a woman. Fuelled by the sugar-free drink Crystal Light, Cynthia methodically fills a vase with alchemical home decorating items. Once her project is completed, Cynthia is again left to dwell in her thoughts. Suddenly a ladder grows out of the vase. Cynthia climbs the ladder and, through a trap door, enters an ecstatic rave complete with a techno remix of the Crystal Light commercial music.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SAIL AWAY SAIL AWAY SAIL AWAY!!!","title":"Whispering Pines 6, 7, 8","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana Moulton","original_name":"Shana Moulton","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/k2NurtqeeB6ApNp7NDYZb3nmicO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Cynthia","credit_id":"57551e7b9251417aa0000f0f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana Moulton","original_name":"Shana Moulton","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/k2NurtqeeB6ApNp7NDYZb3nmicO.jpg","credit_id":"57551ea8c3a3683c90000d1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
