Shoes, cans, string, mirrors; everything we see and touch has an epic tale of how it came to be invented or discovered, and the dramatic moments throughout history at which it played an important role. But few of us know these stories. We go through our days blissfully ignorant of the deadly and dangerous road brave men traveled in order to bring coffee to the world, or the pivotal part beer played in the civilizing of mankind. These stories and many more are brought vividly to life in this two-hour special, which follows one man on a journey through the last day of his life, examining and recounting the epic tales of the everyday items he encounters before his ignorance of their stories leads him to his ultimate doom.","popularity":0.2125,"poster_path":"/9XmQ1kebfaED9JQMyhZWLtMj8cP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23603,"logo_path":null,"name":"NFGTV","origin_country":""},{"id":77571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tribune Media Services","origin_country":""},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Epic History of Everyday Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Vardagstingens historia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Adovasio","original_name":"Jim Adovasio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Expert","credit_id":"574d5b5b925141015e00125b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4523005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahra Alzubaidi","original_name":"Zahra Alzubaidi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/aPKpcveUQYLfSzRNYOQw50FJOn5.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Shammat","credit_id":"6797685e09c252e3ab23cddf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318459,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Ashton","original_name":"Kevin Ashton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Expert","credit_id":"574d5b63c3a36873d70011d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Bitterman","original_name":"Mark Bitterman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Expert","credit_id":"574d5b76925141107f000e39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bostwick","original_name":"William Bostwick","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Expert","credit_id":"574d5b7f925141015e001268","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1815236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert K.
