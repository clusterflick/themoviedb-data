An otherwise ordinary flat in London, owned by its lively but untrustworthy Nigerian Landlord, No. 2 is a room that was born bad. It attracts the wrong people, and something weird always happens there. A young and sensitive writer goaded beyond endurance by an old enemy, an actress who is the victim of a crazed, bomb-making Stalker, a late night seance which goes gruesomely wrong, and a dangerously insane assassin on a gleeful killing spree. Four examples of just how macabre and downright odd Room No. 2's history is.","popularity":0.3056,"poster_path":"/zZJCSkij8WDaIDcPoiQ6cqrtaVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Twelfth Collective, The","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Room No 2, there's always space for one more body","title":"Dead Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2634111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Price","original_name":"Jo Price","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/crstfXOhvjRaVST8uy1yCNkrSsz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lynn","credit_id":"5eba53c1c3514c001e5cf132","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Ofoegbu","original_name":"Anthony Ofoegbu","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63356b5e982f740080416d02","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1663198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Renée","original_name":"Lisa Renée","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":"/hzo34953AzjtLiBQcAovr92Pi4e.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63356b69982f7400836ad863","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":86469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esme Eliot","original_name":"Esme Eliot","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63356b906840cc007e355176","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3220181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex J.
