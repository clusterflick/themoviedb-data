Having spent a lifetime teaching life lessons, the journey into retirement is about to bring her one of her greatest lessons. Her lesson plan will come from a troubled young man, Eli, as she invests in his life. Suzanne also becomes a first-time grandmother, and the new life of the baby brings renewed hope to the family as each member discovers their core value in God's path for their lives. As Suzanne reflects back on her life of faithfulness, we are reminded that there are no accidents in God's Kingdom, no chance meetings, no purposeless steps taken.","popularity":0.8404,"poster_path":"/32iyAmsJDBZr8RaXpzKjO3ul1Ka.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do Not Be Afraid, Just Believe.","title":"God's Compass","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"La Brujula de Dios","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":167132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Abercrombie","original_name":"Karen Abercrombie","popularity":0.4404,"profile_path":"/yDTPfrVXge69QZo8hc8GTDPnW9U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Suzanne Waters","credit_id":"574b578292514119a500142e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":525138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.C.
