A three year old girl abandoned in a food market is sheltered and raised by a deaf and dumb vagrant. They develop a very strong bond. Badiaga dreams of becoming a famous singer and listens in total fascination to the artists who sing in the different cafés where she wanders. One day she has the chance of singing on the radio a song which becomes a national hit. From that moment onwards she holds a nonstop succession of concerts. In love with her career, she refuses any romantic relations and searches desperately for her origins. This story was inspired by the life of Beti-Beti, a legendary Cameroon singer.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/s4bJwOl2gm4vUqwvnVCYjPTRnLO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brief Illness","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justine Sengue","original_name":"Justine Sengue","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"574ba21b9251417fc0000667","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Zanga","original_name":"Alexandre Zanga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61b8227ffa4046001cb28f8f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dikongué-Pipa","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dikongué-Pipa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cCaYtWrOqsS2Q5rcQcDW0bGPaQA.jpg","credit_id":"574ba1f09251415f46000a31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092611","wikidata_id":"Q2878651","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.747,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s4bJwOl2gm4vUqwvnVCYjPTRnLO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
