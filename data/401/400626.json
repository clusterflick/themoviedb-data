Abisag Tüllmann’s photographs have become deeply engraved into our cultural memory. Using more than 500 black-and-white photos, all of which taken by Abisag Tüllmann, this cinematic tribute places her life and work in the context of the 1960s to the 1990s. Claudia von Alemann tries to get close to her friend via pictures and archival documents, excerpts from films by Carola Benninghoven, Helke Sander, Alexander Kluge, Günther Hörmann, and Ulrich Schamoni, via the music of composer José Luis de Delás, and via letters and memories, such as those of photographer Barbara Klemm, who still vividly remembers her former Frankfurt colleague.","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/jXUuCvHaNsGFUFBH34UXJjg4t1p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alemann Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Frau mit der Kamera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1630137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia von Alemann","original_name":"Claudia von Alemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57518085c3a36837720024e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1630137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia von Alemann","original_name":"Claudia von Alemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5751807fc3a3686c5b000ad5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Levi","original_name":"Angelika Levi","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/kqX9dEN7dxriv5NhQWkS18WijoH.jpg","credit_id":"59d4f92f9251414b700194f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Coulanges","original_name":"Rolf Coulanges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4f8e29251414b9901971e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771568,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Zach","original_name":"Peter Zach","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4f910c3a36845280197d0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899961,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oscar Loeser","original_name":"Oscar Loeser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4f953c3a36844e101a23d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899960,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Verena Vargas Koch","original_name":"Verena Vargas Koch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d4f922c3a368457201783e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4842268","wikidata_id":"Q24703942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jXUuCvHaNsGFUFBH34UXJjg4t1p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
