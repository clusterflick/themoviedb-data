The camera, through frame-by-frame tracking and panning shots, goes along revealing furniture, corners, objects and books, using rails in the first instance and a calibrated disk mounted on a tripod in the second. The house vibrates with its own life, revealing almost ghostlike traces and vestiges while the human presence is barely suggested. These shots alternate with others of the landscape: a lake, snow, bushes rattled by the wind, the passing of the seasons, external signs that accentuate the solitude of the interior spaces.","popularity":0.0573,"poster_path":"/z6HIWNrm8Ig7XB0dvlHZTLHxPlh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1975-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passacaglia and Fugue","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Abel","original_name":"Laura Abel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e8ec425258ae00eaa41d8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Honik","original_name":"Jorge Honik","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/lJy4rFZPvPBMsIMHls7YVnS2ZWd.jpg","credit_id":"574dfcec925141120c0008bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5972480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z6HIWNrm8Ig7XB0dvlHZTLHxPlh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/saggB4XeSt8ikHc5dTYYlG4w3Ie.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Gbi1EgI6cDVAahWqx4jNCGafwh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
