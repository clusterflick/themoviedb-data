Now the new moved in West German rules the site. Anyone who opposes him is banned. With a little imagination and a few tricks, he wanted to make the deal of a lifetime. But he has miscalculated and run the property into the ground, bankruptcy is imminent. His employee, the Vietnamese German Pit Sun, somehow keeps the place together and has a child with the owner's daughter. But since he hasn't received any money for a long time, he wants to run away to Vietnam. The tradition-conscious East German campers are also not happy with the bad-tempered campsite operator. It's just as well that Claus Oehlke has robbed a bank and is only throwing the money around to impress his wife. But she only has eyes for the former GDR crooner Michi Fanselow, the dream of her youth.","popularity":0.3353,"poster_path":"/bFsuLXuNKhJ5Vfr3ubnAHAZNr0C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mediopolis Film- und
