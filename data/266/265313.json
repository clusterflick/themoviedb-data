Then based in Chicago, the late Phil Morton created this project as a playful and critical video response in conversation with a local General Motors dealership from whom he had purchased a van.

Produced at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (where Morton founded the Video Area), this work includes Dan Sandin and Tom DeFanti who collaboratively developed the early Video Art scene in Chicago.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Copy-It-Right","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"General Motors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Morton","original_name":"Phil Morton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64bfac8505822401303b2add","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Sandin","original_name":"Dan Sandin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64bfac918ee49c0fcb67494a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom DeFanti","original_name":"Tom DeFanti","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64bfac9f6ee3d701054ef84f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Morton","original_name":"Phil Morton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53507d24c3a3681d8700054f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
