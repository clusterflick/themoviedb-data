Today, Niek and Joe work for TJ Mokoena, but when Joe discovers the ugly underbelly of Mokoena's business, things start going horribly wrong for the down-and-out divorcee. To complicate matters, his stripper girlfriend Peggy is getting tired of him milking her for money. Niek is Joe's only hope, but he too is still battling demons from his time in the war.
