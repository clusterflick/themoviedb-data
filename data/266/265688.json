To be sure, he had forbidden his son to take part in the competition, because the son's grades in school are substandard.  In the end, Brakke sees no other way than to pull Theo from school and install him as an apprentice in his airplane manufacturing plant.  Although Theo is received by the other 150 apprentices in a friendly fashion, he behaves in an arrogant and disrespectful tone towards them.  He feels himself to be better than them, because his father is the director of the factory.","popularity":0.4562,"poster_path":"/pe7qBjDxCyifVDNpeyzCccI0q2M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1944-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Junge
