His wife leaves him to live alone. His son, who is away at school, will not talk to him. He searches for meaning: he seeks the help of a jolly but dismissive physician; he talks to an underworld thug about having his wife murdered; he delves into the life of his driver, the happy-go-lucky Dinu, who has two wives and a mistress, all three of whom love Dinu, all three of whom Dinu cherishes; last, he returns in his mind to the magical possibilities of his childhood, when he could open doors using only a nursery rhyme.","popularity":0.1427,"poster_path":"/7oh0fefki2R2rHkEw1cuJDj3BoT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1997-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Door","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Red Door","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Subhendu Chatterjee","original_name":"Subhendu Chatterjee","popularity":0.295,"profile_path":"/3yZrYSV5IUhXm0e6c7dLGUiTj85.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5350f7c70e0a26560a000e2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biplab Chatterjee","original_name":"Biplab Chatterjee","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/6enxwkD23de64Hb9WS2fO2aAoLX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"644cf1b5726fb10520068ebc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haradhan Bandopadhyay","original_name":"Haradhan Bandopadhyay","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/4CmmZxAVPzHArWCcynb5lCZX21j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644cf1c35e14e50313b87fca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":968635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barun Chanda","original_name":"Barun Chanda","popularity":0.3604,"profile_path":"/qlkol3jILlfnZ3tCdUGIArDbPj5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"644cf1d353f83302fb1951fd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Buddhadeb Dasgupta","original_name":"Buddhadeb Dasgupta","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/rDm0uUmK8Buzq3SAELkwT6jOIaA.jpg","credit_id":"5350f7e90e0a265606000d48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142521","wikidata_id":"Q1449790","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7oh0fefki2R2rHkEw1cuJDj3BoT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLyNbbGjkgOGar0NCQUpTajrh3m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
