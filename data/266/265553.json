Morecambe and Wise delighted millions with their unique brand of humour, they reigned supreme in the 60s, 70s and 80s as comedy kings and their success and popularity has never since been equalled.  The filming of this concert was a present from their long time manager as a way of showing thanks and admiration for all their hard work over the years.  When you watch this video, you will be witnessing comedy history in the making, for the first time in years Morecambe and Wise are once again live in concert.
