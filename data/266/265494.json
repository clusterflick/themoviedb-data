In 1534, when he stopped at the island he named l'Île-aux-Coudres, Jacques Cartier saw how the Indians captured the little white beluga whales by setting a fence of saplings into off-shore mud. In the film, the islanders show that the old method still works, thanks to the trusting 'sea-pigs,' the same old tide, and a little magic.","popularity":0.3332,"poster_path":"/iTjo8qBVLsLB85pF9uLCPvfPnCq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beluga Days","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Beluga Days","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Tremblay","original_name":"Alexis Tremblay","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (uncredited)","credit_id":"573ff79992514177f2000c6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2708493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Harvey","original_name":"Louis Harvey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self (uncredited)","credit_id":"65fa6d2afe6318017dfbc9de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Léopold Tremblay","original_name":"Léopold Tremblay","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self (uncredited)","credit_id":"65fa6d6a0bc529017cae06cd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Brault","original_name":"Michel Brault","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/bDGiQWl2UblKpR9h1qFQ3THUsj1.jpg","credit_id":"5351d6f10e0a265614002037","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5351d7320e0a26560a0020c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Perrault","original_name":"Pierre Perrault","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/c8Vwck8Mvpgl3hLvHbnmwjjbjGo.jpg","credit_id":"5351d74b0e0a265611002169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293894,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Pelletier","original_name":"Claude Pelletier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573ffa74c3a3680736000e9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590848,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Bobet","original_name":"Jacques Bobet","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573ff87192514177ef000d53","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1594953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy L.
