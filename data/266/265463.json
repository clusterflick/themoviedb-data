Their plans are cut tragically short, however, when the family's unhinged caretaker shoots Buddy dead as he arrives on the property under the cover of night. Years later, Annie, now an old reclusive, continues to pine after her lost love, even practicing magic rituals in an attempt to bring him back. One day, after suffering ridicule and harassment from some local teens, she decides to end her own life. Coming to the farm in the wake of her aunt's passing, Annie's niece, Hillie, soon learns from reading her diary that Annie actually believed she'd resurrected Buddy. Sure enough, when some of the youths responsible for driving her aunt to suicide show up looking to cause trouble, a mysterious figure in biker gear appears and begins picking them off one by one. Has Buddy risen from the dead to avenge his dearly departed?","popularity":0.2061,"poster_path":"/6Sqx91r9kDehjlpGzc8u1351LqW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not even death could keep them apart!","title":"Deadly Love","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Alves","original_name":"Jim Alves","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Clint","credit_id":"6178b35e0d5d850065f399d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Oglesby","original_name":"Mark Oglesby","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Buddy","credit_id":"6178b36cf2cf25004384e3b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3285898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassie Brown","original_name":"Cassie Brown","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"6178b379678259006277cdd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myron Sayan","original_name":"Myron Sayan","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Butler","credit_id":"6178b38babf8e2002c36845b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Hutton","original_name":"Tracy Hutton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Buster","credit_id":"6178b398678259008fd386fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Helenowski","original_name":"Jack Helenowski","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jimbo","credit_id":"6178b3ab70b4440043d91fd4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4765805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lizzie Hart","original_name":"Lizzie Hart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Lori","credit_id":"6666273aedfd2b64899f439d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4781443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Parkyn","original_name":"Tim Parkyn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Bernie","credit_id":"66712605a7e1c357c18e45d1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4781445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Reynolds","original_name":"Buddy Reynolds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Skip","credit_id":"66712617a8d9875827f2f55f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4781447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Gentile","original_name":"Ron Gentile","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Mr. Briscoe","credit_id":"6671262c761089e4b5f2f466","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1900209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kelly O'Rourke","original_name":"Kelly O'Rourke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Hillie (as Eileen Hart)","credit_id":"666627214e3938456ae9ce63","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285910,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Hackett","original_name":"Don Hackett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Caretaker","credit_id":"66712646245b1b0a770df272","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Thomas","original_name":"Pat Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"DJ Voice (voice)","credit_id":"6671265d245b1b0a770df278","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381363,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael S.
