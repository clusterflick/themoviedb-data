He is freeloading off his girlfriend Kiriko, who works as a tattoo artist. One day, he is offered to do a rather eccentric job from an otaku-looking public employee named Nirasawa, who claims that Masaru’s voice is necessary in activating a giant robot named Land Zeppelin. He goes on straight-faced that the Earth is about to be attacked by Saturnians, and the robot is necessary in the fight against them. At first, Masaru ignores this far-fetched story, but one day he is framed in a dangerous job he takes on together with his friend Kou, and is driven into a tight squeeze. What will happen to Masaru? Does this robot Land Zeppelin really exist?","popularity":0.5728,"poster_path":"/qrpdjWzHp0GkQ3IW5I8YUegr3I1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robo Rock","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ロボ・ロック","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minami","original_name":"美波","popularity":0.9783,"profile_path":"/bA3wVfJWHGeb5VTdXcbXFLt1R7F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kiriko","credit_id":"535255190e0a265611002e2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shun Shioya","original_name":"塩谷瞬","popularity":0.3158,"profile_path":"/tBUxlDcgs2EDU3KdnPwyRbhMrIg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Masaru Hagiwara","credit_id":"5352554d0e0a265606002c3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuichiro Nakayama","original_name":"中山祐一朗","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Etsuro Nirasawa","credit_id":"5352557f0e0a26560e002dd1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":578797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shoichi Honda","original_name":"本多章一","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/uj0ECDafFAEi1SlEf5bvqVQGMAu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"616a23f5be2d49002d1e14b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken'ichi Endô","original_name":"遠藤憲一","popularity":0.8973,"profile_path":"/5NyLtChKpQ0KLiYjZ3aSDylBIou.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"616a240133a53300293b3d9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico Aletta","original_name":"Federico Aletta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"616a240fec187900618a6587","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Yamamoto","original_name":"山本浩司","popularity":0.4336,"profile_path":"/w1ywYvhyoQ45244n1Bm1iPtmG6n.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"616a24299715ae004478bd3e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taikan Suga","original_name":"Taikan Suga","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5352542ac3a3681da500261f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toshimitsu Takeuchi","original_name":"竹内利光","popularity":0.2261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53525451c3a3681da00025e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yusuke Watanabe","original_name":"渡辺雄介","popularity":0.4023,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53525494c3a3681d93002695","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607248,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Sosuke Yoshikado","original_name":"吉角荘介","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678cfa76d094ea7af1433835","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1147627","wikidata_id":"Q7565782","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":786,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qrpdjWzHp0GkQ3IW5I8YUegr3I1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/zo1SYOqTcd1cRcfHBdvV7ywjw9u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"「ROBO☆ROCK」予告編","key":"CrvQgJJvsvE","published_at":"2007-10-30T01:46:18.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"535254c0c3a3681da5002627"}]}}}
