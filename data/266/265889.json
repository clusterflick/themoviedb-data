Are you ready for waves of laughter and adventure?  Then put on your floaties, grab your boogie boards, and jump in!  Its the hottest day of the year - even Goofy's chicken noodle ice cream cone has melted into soup!  So Mickey and his pals are cooling off at Star Lake.  Pate's hosting a Hawaiian Luau, and it just might be the best beach bash ever, but only if YOU can help the gang pick the right mouseketools to get the party started.  You'll ride a tide of fun with Mickey as you reel in a big, red Gooey fish, float above the clouds with Pluto in a giant soap bubble, and help Donald rescue a flock of lost ducks.  Filled with music, excitement and magical surprises, Mickey's Big Splash will make you shout, \"MOUSEKA-BUNGA!\"","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/exiwPoYB3BbQHdL4GzWfkKeLj05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dive into Fun!","title":"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey's Big Splash","video":true,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Mickey's Big Splash","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Mickey's Strandfeest","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/exiwPoYB3BbQHdL4GzWfkKeLj05.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
