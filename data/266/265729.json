The film revolves around the notion of a sense of place and stories associated with place, reflecting on the subterranean traces of the past in the present and probing themes such as the impact of colonialism, emigration, the famine, land, housing and the place of art in society.  Making extensive use of archive from RTÃ‰ and the IFI, the film seeks to explore the more elusive layers of meaning that make up this country.","popularity":0.0703,"poster_path":"/nsAdJ8Q0U4JLxZ8yanEsBj29I3I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82147,"logo_path":"/fAxocDV9VNFVa009O2OFYyR2Fee.png","name":"Harvest Films","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living in a Coded Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Collins","original_name":"Pat Collins","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/pGfVDUGuuXHhlvgXk5lX3chWHy7.jpg","credit_id":"5744e3b2c3a3684ccd0000a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Collins","original_name":"Pat Collins","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/pGfVDUGuuXHhlvgXk5lX3chWHy7.jpg","credit_id":"5744e3d292514129a00000a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tadhg O'Sullivan","original_name":"Tadhg O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/rS1saRHUNTHlFVcTDeqrn0nw7E6.jpg","credit_id":"5744e3e492514129a90000a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Feargal Ward","original_name":"Feargal Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/unDYejjQrOlhGWgLjwvLKt2mrOH.jpg","credit_id":"5744e407c3a3684cc10000b9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625501,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Brennan","original_name":"John Brennan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5744e421c3a3684cba0000a4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nsAdJ8Q0U4JLxZ8yanEsBj29I3I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Jameson Dublin International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"limited","release_date":"2014-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
