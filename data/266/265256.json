Their grandma often takes care of them. As Manuel visits his mother, he finds out about her plans to go on a honeymoon with her friend Robert. Manuel, who wants to go on holiday with his mother, is upset about this and doesn't return from the visit. His father thinks the mother kept Manuel and requests a house search. Meanwhile, Manuel accommodates himself at his teacher's and astonishes her with inexplicable reactions until she realizes that Manuel is just looking for love and attention. The plot is interrupted by several cutbacks from Manuel's memories of the parent's conflicting relationship.","popularity":0.3414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody Wants Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Bennett","original_name":"Steven Bennett","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Manuel","credit_id":"53503a14c3a3681d9300001f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursela Monn","original_name":"Ursela Monn","popularity":0.3078,"profile_path":"/cnPjvONjUC2PCSiD1zt0bjhZqjK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karen","credit_id":"53503a2bc3a3681d81000023","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sattmann","original_name":"Peter Sattmann","popularity":0.433,"profile_path":"/m6vmw12Wce8FtCHHdUEkQfig11u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Father","credit_id":"53503a46c3a3681d98000029","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Herwig","original_name":"Paul Herwig","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Holger","credit_id":"53503a5dc3a3681d8700002f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Seum","original_name":"Peter Seum","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"53503a6fc3a3681d9300002a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1310533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabina Trooger","original_name":"Sabina Trooger","popularity":0.1635,"profile_path":"/5lpnuJOpDC4w1j1EHkbzN6D9aDr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"53503a81c3a3681d9300002c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigi Rothemund","original_name":"Sigi Rothemund","popularity":0.1661,"profile_path":"/sz6LoMZCZiWAxBYDf2E40480w6J.jpg","credit_id":"53503ad5c3a3681d93000033","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Christoff","original_name":"Daniel Christoff","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53503ae2c3a3681da5000035","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323243","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
