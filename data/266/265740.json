While not showing her childhood, first marriage to Winston Churchill's son, or most of her affairs, we do get to see her affair and eventual marriage to Broadway producer Leland Hayward, and then her marriage to politician Averell Harriman, with whom she had an affair while both were married to others in World War II. We also see her as ambassador to France during her last years, and her death in 1997. While some (mostly her lovers) adored her, others (mostly her son and her husbands' children) hated her.","popularity":1.6689,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life of the Party: The Pamela Harriman Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann-Margret","original_name":"Ann-Margret","popularity":1.6463,"profile_path":"/7cq76gMW4Mal5cctMLCK8wilJ6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pamela Harriman","credit_id":"5354325ec3a3681d8d0047fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitchell Ryan","original_name":"Mitchell Ryan","popularity":0.6936,"profile_path":"/9XrbQfOjDeqjXJUHeSIA6OxJAJa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Averell Harriman","credit_id":"5354328e0e0a265614005008","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Strickland","original_name":"Gail Strickland","popularity":0.4822,"profile_path":"/nvSOOk3P1VQsgxC3FOYki5JIlF8.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney","credit_id":"5c360b460e0a265a807c585c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Radford","original_name":"Natalie Radford","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Pamela Harriman at 20","credit_id":"535432a00e0a26561400500a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John DeMita","original_name":"John DeMita","popularity":0.3089,"profile_path":"/cIUd7zTcGzJ0CMSkL4SUOee3gME.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Peter Duchin","credit_id":"535432a90e0a26560a0050d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Ruttan","original_name":"Susan Ruttan","popularity":0.6663,"profile_path":"/1Ng5Xyse5tbwmQsdKSJ6IFhHNvo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Janet","credit_id":"5c360b2f92514122eaea880e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Walsh","original_name":"Sydney Walsh","popularity":0.5532,"profile_path":"/fN424zUdIOSpW8HaEtKjQUQnaF3.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Minnie Churchill","credit_id":"5c360b680e0a265a777c4514","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Severance","original_name":"Joan Severance","popularity":0.6404,"profile_path":"/2bgZLV4KYig6p7aXIMkDCwGx4yZ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Paley","credit_id":"5c360b830e0a265a7a7c45c2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":159816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Harris","original_name":"Cynthia Harris","popularity":0.3437,"profile_path":"/uTq1LUOBIt9wOfL0SOY44hBzMuF.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Kathleen","credit_id":"5c360b9f0e0a265a7d7c44ef","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Landon Jr.","original_name":"Hal Landon Jr.","popularity":0.4207,"profile_path":"/ga7W0dAntkpKmnnMkTFtgxqQV2n.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Episcopal Bishop","credit_id":"5ee18a57f031740022de8674","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":993201,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lisa Friedman Bloch","original_name":"Lisa Friedman Bloch","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5354323ac3a3681d8d0047f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Waris Hussein","original_name":"Waris Hussein","popularity":0.4649,"profile_path":"/86NUelJxUm21py3cDceQBmzxOuF.jpg","credit_id":"53543247c3a3681d8d0047fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311640,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathy Kirtland Silverman","original_name":"Kathy Kirtland Silverman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53543231c3a3681d870049ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0160468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4178,"name":"courtesan"},{"id":9840,"name":"romance"},{"id":10329,"name":"wealth"},{"id":157286,"name":"gold digger"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
