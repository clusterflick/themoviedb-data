His ability to take control of the ball -- the game -- an entire tournament -- split the world in two.  It was both illuminating and an affront, beguiling and an outrage, and the fervor that surrounded him was unprecedented, bordering on the religious. Constructed from archive material, \"Maradona '86\" is an ode to this ultimate footballing idol, basking in the operatic intensity of his performance in Mexico as he wrote his name on football history forever.","popularity":0.115,"poster_path":"/pL1nY9ddYBw1ODVNBs9UJjh1ZoX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maradona '86","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Mexico 1986: När Maradona briljerade","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Blair","original_name":"Sam Blair","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/4KZoEAXc3zaGdvDBhRISfejCQcH.jpg","credit_id":"6210ceb2e72fe80043b44445","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Blair","original_name":"Sam Blair","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/4KZoEAXc3zaGdvDBhRISfejCQcH.jpg","credit_id":"53514310c3a3681d930014a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3762742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pL1nY9ddYBw1ODVNBs9UJjh1ZoX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
