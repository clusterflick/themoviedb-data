In Old German it means “far away, lost in time”. There are other villages with unique names in the country, such as Jamerthal, Batatenthal, Padre Eterno and Frankenthal. These are communities that have their own dynamics and still live far from the globalized world. Many of its inhabitants never learned to speak Portuguese and communicate in a German dialect transmitted by generations of descendants. However, they know nothing of their original Germany. They are all Brazilian and identify themselves as such.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walachai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rejane Zilles","original_name":"Rejane Zilles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5354ebf00e0a2655fe005f7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3830290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
