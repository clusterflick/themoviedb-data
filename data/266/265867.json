This fictionalized story of Jana, an eight-year-old Gypsy girl snatched from her parents and consigned to a life of orphanages and bleak foster homes, is based on a little-known chapter of Swiss history: From 1926 to 1972, the state-supported Pro Juventute, a children's aid foundation, forcibly removed some 700 Gypsy children from their families, in order to sever the ties with their culture and assimilate them to a \"better way of life.\" The underlying aim was to preempt a new generation's caravans from following their nomadic traditions along Switzerland's country lanes.","popularity":0.4208,"poster_path":"/34l6Ry1NDxDbOblOjrW7PzU1A14.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panorama Films
