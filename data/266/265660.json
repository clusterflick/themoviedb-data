Ganesh, the protagonist, is a potter who leads a happy and contented life in a remote village. The only ambition he and his wife Kurjan share is to get their only son Laxman married and bring a daughter-in- law home. Destiny, however, has ordained otherwise. Ganesh is hand picked for his honesty and dedication by a local charitable Seth to become the caretaker of his inn in the middle of the desert. There, Ganesh and Kurjan meet a wealthy couple, who are greatly pleased with their service and hospitality. They offer to take their son Laxman to distant lands, teach him trade and make him fabulously rich.","popularity":0.2634,"poster_path":"/7CGMy5Cs8iAn1SfToi0rzMjG7c1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1989-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parinati","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Inevitable","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basant Josalkar","original_name":"Basant Josalkar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ganesh","credit_id":"573557a3925141672c0011e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surekha Sikri","original_name":"Surekha Sikri","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/ocqxFmHr4TKTgTgrZrVXxshT5jy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ganesh's wife","credit_id":"573557aac3a36802620012de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sudhir Kulkarni","original_name":"Sudhir Kulkarni","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"573557b9c3a36802620012e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharda Desoares","original_name":"Sharda Desoares","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(as Sharda D'Soares)","credit_id":"573557c1c3a36802620012ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.D.
