After flying some distance, Abel discovers himself alone on a river island, unable to swim due to the powerful current. Abel periodically attempts to leave the island by various means: flying on a leaf, rowing a crudely fashioned boat, etc. Meanwhile, he tries to create a normal life of sorts, even learning to enjoy a new hobby: sculpture. Still, Abel's goal is to escape the island and rejoin his wife in the city.","popularity":0.8952,"poster_path":"/bQRtQz0A9fVk3lSvcq86wnlTDES.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1988-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abel's Island","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"När Abel blåste bort","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Curry","original_name":"Tim Curry","popularity":3.8766,"profile_path":"/lYVYVNsPDzeLL6ReCRhh8kezu4y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Abel (voice)","credit_id":"535497cb0e0a26560600571e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Jeffries","original_name":"Lionel Jeffries","popularity":0.5151,"profile_path":"/xWSvHUHofPDlVgiJPk4S8qyonWL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gower (voice)","credit_id":"535497df0e0a26561d00591d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1311677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Stallings","original_name":"Heidi Stallings","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Amanda (voice)","credit_id":"535497f30e0a265603005b4a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2835872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giuliana Nicodemi","original_name":"Giuliana Nicodemi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60abc6ee3d7005e5166ce","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Sporn","original_name":"Michael Sporn","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60a636bdec300461485c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839494,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bridget Thorne","original_name":"Bridget Thorne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60b1028723c007efc1ec1","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604001,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Doug Compton","original_name":"Doug Compton","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60b9ed7cd0600460c53cb","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839494,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bridget Thorne","original_name":"Bridget Thorne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60b192811a1005e9837a7","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3149485,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Steven Dovas","original_name":"Steven Dovas","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60b9228723c007efc2003","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839494,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bridget Thorne","original_name":"Bridget Thorne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60a84a3b5e6005d91beee","department":"Writing","job":"Storyboard"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arthur Custer","original_name":"Arthur Custer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60b65cd2046005c5f84e7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Sporn","original_name":"Michael Sporn","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60aa44d6791005e3ae65c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Marianetti","original_name":"Robert Marianetti","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/hs3TYsOPlYDJiKftfnBHwGbcS0W.jpg","credit_id":"60e60b45cd20460046670479","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15779,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gregory Perler","original_name":"Gregory Perler","popularity":0.2546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60ad6b76cbb005d00e661","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Sporn","original_name":"Michael Sporn","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e60b888de0ae007e826f45","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229066,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John R.
