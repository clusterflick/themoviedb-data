The concert was filmed, simulcast on ABC-TV and Triple J, and released on video, which was remastered for their 2004 Best of Both Worlds DVD.  Oils on the Water: A classic Midnight Oil performance was recorded on Goat Island in Sydney Harbour on 13 January 1985. Never before or since has the band performed in such a setting; every time Peter Garrett turned up stage he was caught in the light of the setting sun, reflected by the city and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.","popularity":0.4575,"poster_path":"/aQGFfpwV7iuXDTFrkzsC2egtPPr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183533,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Music Australia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1985-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Oil Goat Island Triple J Concert","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Garrett","original_name":"Peter Garrett","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/meelksENoJ7PYK7Yr5UOvyRtoVu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"534ff2700e0a267eb20010d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Moginie","original_name":"Jim Moginie","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/9shWVoWHoOh7en39Hlm2TpaBuW6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"guitar, keyboard","credit_id":"534ff2b10e0a267eb900116a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Moginie","original_name":"Jim Moginie","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/9shWVoWHoOh7en39Hlm2TpaBuW6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"guitar","credit_id":"534ff2d40e0a267eaf00118c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Hirst","original_name":"Rob Hirst","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/tN91GvnrK7lyNJAcAmuQDMWq1wq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Drums, Vocal","credit_id":"534ff3110e0a267ea8001177","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bones Hillman","original_name":"Bones Hillman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vocal, Bass","credit_id":"534ff3310e0a267ea40011fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gifford","original_name":"Peter Gifford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vocal, Bass","credit_id":"534ff34d0e0a267ea10011c6","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQGFfpwV7iuXDTFrkzsC2egtPPr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":208289,"name":"1980s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"ABC Music – 13830, Universal Music Australia – 13830 Released 2004","release_date":"1985-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
