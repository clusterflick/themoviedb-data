When November 11, an official holiday (Armistice), falls on a Tuesday, the public service often gets an extra day off on the preceding Monday, but only after a formal ministerial decision, and this time it gets all the way trough the hierarchy to the right office- and then isn't read, so all the colleagues turn up, only to be told they should have stayed at home. It gets worse: works in progress and clumsiness end up blocking the way out both by lift and staircase, so they are stuck on their floor, apparently without a phone, while there's nobody outside who can hear and rescue them. Forced to keep their conversation going, some secrets get unearthed, and it's not a very pretty picture they got of each-other.","popularity":0.2329,"poster_path":"/8hw8yvovJOuZWpEgyHcJNsIkSXu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colleagues Make the Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"De collega's maken de brug","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Van der Veken","original_name":"Bob Van der Veken","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/8CBB1QThiuVLfEnPuE1MNk2D1ms.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paul Thienpondt","credit_id":"5353fb5cc3a3681d93004482","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaak Van Assche","original_name":"Jaak Van Assche","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/donIuteBNmwLhT5Iwmyp0zlxFYf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jean De Pesser","credit_id":"5353fb71c3a3681da0004361","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuur de Weert","original_name":"Tuur de Weert","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/rggWMRd4MhMHZcbqEYxVFRp7gnz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gilbert Van Hie","credit_id":"5353fb88c3a3681d870045b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manu Verreth","original_name":"Manu Verreth","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jomme Dockx","credit_id":"5353fba0c3a3681da5004335","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Verreth","original_name":"René Verreth","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/hFOPlIbS9vH1a9yWxnB9mXhasQg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Philemon Persez","credit_id":"5353fbb7c3a3681d98004417","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1311606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Tilley","original_name":"Nora Tilley","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/9eKTxXobAdGIYCyR8E7kJEnwgtd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Karolijn Van Kersbeke","credit_id":"5353fbd7c3a3681d8d004402","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandus De Vos","original_name":"Mandus De Vos","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bonaventuur Verastenhoven","credit_id":"5353fbf3c3a3681da500433d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tessy Moerenhout","original_name":"Tessy Moerenhout","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Betty Bossé","credit_id":"5353fc05c3a3681da5004343","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1241697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacky Morel","original_name":"Jacky Morel","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Hilaire Baconfoy","credit_id":"5353fc20c3a3681d810044e2","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311600,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jan Matterne","original_name":"Jan Matterne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5353fb34c3a3681da500432d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1250769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Rouffaer","original_name":"Vincent Rouffaer","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5353fb13c3a3681d7b00459b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133901","wikidata_id":"Q1901143","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/3kZjNUR32NwLCa15aUJCTE3dCtb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/8hw8yvovJOuZWpEgyHcJNsIkSXu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":884,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/uCrE90Yz98hJG74HMzNazKoHj2w.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":589},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":783,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/xbkpgH1b20HjOEoF9wQJ0WHHIsY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/xIhTVqRlSEXTrr6hgF0Bxu06qtT.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/x3wWBUh3khvubTOHytc6gEzjQpv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"no","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
