In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published Light and Refraction, his study of the interactions between sunlight and prisms.  Newton was, as a good scientist, intent on achieving objectivity, which meant studying sunlight in isolation. He thought colors were contained solely in light, and found the spectrum he was looking for.  When he reproduced this experiment, Goethe found another, hidden set of colors missed by Newton. Goethe found the hidden colors in the boundaries between light and darkness.  He felt, as an artist, that one could not talk about light without including darkness. Calling it 'the light-darkness polarity', Goethe made this new scientific discovery using artistic methods in conjunction with science.","popularity":0.538,"poster_path":"/rpebvyfi50C8sl0jKdq0dsllNtf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86920,"logo_path":"/pCcXrfcnCWVZDU7EXQAN9yOWsZc.png","name":"Magic Hour Films","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":160279,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV-VENTURES","origin_country":""},{"id":155300,"logo_path":null,"name":"E-Motion Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":160280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hysteria Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Darkness and Colour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bateson","original_name":"David Bateson","popularity":0.2614,"profile_path":"/jau0kFM2cMepmoVk2SdPQvmJFvf.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"669261fe5ced9bdda0c46db1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40414,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henrik 'Gugge' Garnov","original_name":"Henrik 'Gugge' Garnov","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626c7989fcadb400506fd98c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrik Boetius","original_name":"Henrik Boetius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53545391c3a3681d7b004b88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henrik Moetius","original_name":"Henrik Moetius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53545364c3a3681d93004a77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311658,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie Louise Lauridsen","original_name":"Marie Louise Lauridsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53545377c3a3681d7b004b82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311660,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie Louise Lefevre","original_name":"Marie Louise Lefevre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535453aac3a3681d81004b40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96169,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lise Lense-Møller","original_name":"Lise Lense-Møller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535453dcc3a3681d93004a81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311658,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie Louise Lauridsen","original_name":"Marie Louise Lauridsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5354539cc3a3681da5004932","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319716,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Manuel Sellner","original_name":"Manuel Sellner","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340336e3fa2f0065a511a5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647683,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Englesson","original_name":"Peter Englesson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340359b7abb50043e10ca2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773546,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Palle Mikkelborg","original_name":"Palle Mikkelborg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613403925e12000061d26fb3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1949209","wikidata_id":"Q19827558","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":797,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q23kTM4anRqyK2ytz6bi59xZNX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1416}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rpebvyfi50C8sl0jKdq0dsllNtf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":284629,"name":"color science"},{"id":284630,"name":"color theory"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
