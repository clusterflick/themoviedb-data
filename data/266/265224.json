Forming in 1969, Supertramp quickly rose in popularity and established themselves as one of the most popular of the crossover Art-Rock/mainstream bands. They became a staple on FM and had a string of huge selling singles and albums.  Their popularity began to fade in the 1980′s as musical tastes changed with Art-Rock falling out of favor with New Wave. The band eventually went on extended hiatus and reformed later with personnel changes.  But there was a time in the mid-seventies where you couldn’t turn on a radio without hearing at least one, if not several Supertramp songs in one sitting; all of which you knew by heart.","popularity":0.2161,"poster_path":"/Aq0nletpftdnQfQBh8dt8uIAd0f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supertramp - BBC in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Davies","original_name":"Rick Davies","popularity":0.3041,"profile_path":"/zS4H2EveM7lROk156puJnI0JCo9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - keyboards, vocals","credit_id":"534ffb670e0a267eb2001198","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Helliwell","original_name":"John Helliwell","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/cd7Xaizuj8TtMjyugMjcDrHUgda.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - saxophone, vocals","credit_id":"534ffb7a0e0a267eb9001291","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Hodgson","original_name":"Roger Hodgson","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/tdYCZ5APb4r8z8jRMvbXcPDeY3R.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - guitar, keyboards, vocals","credit_id":"534ffb920e0a267ea100127f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1148501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dougie Thomson","original_name":"Dougie Thomson","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":"/99DLUGo64UAqbsmSpegxHkv1sbj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - bass","credit_id":"534ffbbc0e0a267eb200119f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Siebenberg","original_name":"Bob Siebenberg","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/pShf1wkqNvcfnqjbgUETMkEBJMG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - drums","credit_id":"5cbdcae50e0a266b27ec9f6c","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aq0nletpftdnQfQBh8dt8uIAd0f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
