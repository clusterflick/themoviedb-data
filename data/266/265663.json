The government succeeds in evacuating the residents by giving them compensation for the properties they own. The village temple priest Duggajja, his son Ganapa, and his daughter-in-law Nagi find it impossible to leave their homeland and make a living with the meager compensation given by the government. On the island, they are important people, but outside, they would be one among hundreds of families struggling to make a living. The film narrates the struggles of the family and how ultimately in the end they manage to continue life on the island.","popularity":0.2906,"poster_path":"/hNzywb93TEfgbWsEs9eWOY1y8tl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2002-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":288587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soundarya","original_name":"Soundarya","popularity":0.5585,"profile_path":"/5AWHfyC9q99GnvJR7eOYNBMaZQx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nagi","credit_id":"558813e4c3a36837e9006552","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avinash","original_name":"Avinash","popularity":0.3679,"profile_path":"/uvDw1elYkPDooFNnq6yHJKBhz6s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ganapa","credit_id":"55881402c3a3682746007c6c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasudar Rao","original_name":"Vasudar Rao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"558814149251411e8d006ad0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harish Raj","original_name":"Harish Raj","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"558814239251411dec006d41","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422258,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"M.
