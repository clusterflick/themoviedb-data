It features the original hits of Deep Purple before their 1984 reunion. Aided by a TV advertising campaign it would become Purple's third UK #1 album.  It was at one point the longest album ever released as a single LP, but it was overtaken by Def Leppard's Hysteria album in 1987.  This also marked the debut of \"Demon's Eye\" for the North American release, where it was replaced by \"Strange Kind of Woman\" on Fireball.  The film, released on DVD with the 30th anniversary edition, features track by track Jon Lord interviews.","popularity":0.9247,"poster_path":"/ytkglXwmkcCKwELdYTA02XUVSQ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Purple - Deepest Purple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ritchie Blackmore","original_name":"Ritchie Blackmore","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/m6AeffGBbRvKHdiw3dgyyiMa9gD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Guitar","credit_id":"534fe84f0e0a267ea100108b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Gillan","original_name":"Ian Gillan","popularity":0.1024,"profile_path":"/j6uzpezo3eAT2kSqHaTvOu3OXrn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Vocals","credit_id":"534fe8750e0a267eb6000fe0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Glover","original_name":"Roger Glover","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/j0l606xDT1VozkxBjwbkunlz2Cm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Bass","credit_id":"534fe8900e0a267ea8001054","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Lord","original_name":"Jon Lord","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/jgC2AryDfFoWULtaBlEObe9TCkx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Organ, Keyboards, Hammond Organ, Backing Vocals","credit_id":"534fe8e20e0a267ea1001099","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Evans","original_name":"Rod Evans","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/kuUrYHJq2Bvk7tzySZso8NH3X6Y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Vocals","credit_id":"534fe9050e0a267ea100109c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Paice","original_name":"Ian Paice","popularity":0.1656,"profile_path":"/aY4DYfFlPqWlMdDabxiNFzVLCAF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Drums and Percussion","credit_id":"534fe9310e0a267ea800105a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":548770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Simper","original_name":"Nick Simper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xuXYHDlxSuqapSJ43YghHqR2lhj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself - Bass, Backing Vocals","credit_id":"534fe9510e0a267eb9001073","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Coverdale","original_name":"David Coverdale","popularity":0.5728,"profile_path":"/yO85hLAzX6yQ66x5bHOXwvB5Z5w.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself - Lead Vocals","credit_id":"534fe9760e0a267eaf00106c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Hughes","original_name":"Glenn Hughes","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/eyxdrTzPIdwpylqGifzLhvWJXTH.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Bass, Vocals","credit_id":"534fe9960e0a267ea40010cd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Bolin","original_name":"Tommy Bolin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Guitar","credit_id":"534fe9b60e0a267eb9001079","order":9}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytkglXwmkcCKwELdYTA02XUVSQ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The film was released with the 30th anniversary edition of the album in 2010.","release_date":"2010-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
