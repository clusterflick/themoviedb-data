Only one of the three; Paul Bunnell's \"Final Destination: Unknown\" (copyrighted 1989), is actually horror. The other two; Armand Garabidian's \"Ten Seconds to Countdown\" (copyrighted 1986) and Ephraim Schwartz's \"Creatures of Habit\" (also 1986), are, respectively, science fiction and drama with only slight mystery components. The three used here are connected only in that they were shorts made by UCLA graduate students. Sadly, none of them is very good. The opening title screens and closing credits have been left intact for each.","popularity":0.3592,"poster_path":"/7udY8vaU8K6cl0bDxl7NDA739bZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Platinum Productions Incorporated","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrifying Tales","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Warner","original_name":"Christine Warner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Young Woman (\"Ten Seconds to Countdown\")","credit_id":"58c495dc925141637300352d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":122593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Magarian","original_name":"Andrew Magarian","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sonny Blake (segment \"Final Destination Unknown\")","credit_id":"58c495f7c3a3681670003421","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Fuller","original_name":"Lisa Fuller","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/1MG8qdhQjVjoYNBuxTMDh0vqpzl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Angela Godfrey (segment \"Final Destination Unknown\")","credit_id":"58c496099251416361003531","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James R.
