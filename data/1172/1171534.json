THE CITY explores this humanity, now, in New York City, through the unique eyes of non-native New Yorkers, exiles, immigrants, refugees, eccentrics, and a Ghost. A collage of stories, together with the montage of images, sound and music, running through the film like a heartbeat, create New York moments, frozen in a particular time. Accompanied by haunting visuals, Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry, and a unique score by Sxip Shirey's \"mutant harmonica,\" THE CITY is also a visual poem to a city of immigrants, which keeps re-inventing itself through its history, and into the new century.","popularity":0.2187,"poster_path":"/r8G67wSvtBfhhPxfVWLYRe6Aid8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47893,"logo_path":"/jZOQ7JKsZ6LPckWm9JFAjrSgi7Q.png","name":"Surla Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Explores the human condition, now, in New York City, through the unique eyes of non-native New Yorkers, exiles, immigrants, refugees, eccentrics, and a Ghost.","title":"The City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladan Nikolić","original_name":"Vladan Nikolić","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eeaf8ce0ca7f010de2ed63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1047810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6x8zvuGGNqQTwA1Mr82ZxQ2dCJw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r8G67wSvtBfhhPxfVWLYRe6Aid8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SouthSide Film Festival","release_date":"2007-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
