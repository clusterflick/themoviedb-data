He hasn't picked up much of the language, and has visited most of the tourist sites in Rome itself. A fellow American suggests that he rent a car and visit some old ruins just a short drive from the city. When he gets there he finds the villagers unfriendly, and a large group of teenagers that constantly follow him around. He quickly realizes that he may be in trouble, but it may also be the case that he gets what he deserves.","popularity":0.8356,"poster_path":"/3WDhTW5UMjSuyaNng94Yx4K9nGV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Alda Nuova","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Carson","original_name":"Jack Carson","popularity":0.445,"profile_path":"/lOYGfx1zbsrhpqzL1svLE1LmFYe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frankie Fane","credit_id":"64ede400594c940139ca5830","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Hitchcock","original_name":"Alfred Hitchcock","popularity":1.3971,"profile_path":"/108fiNM6poRieMg7RIqLJRxdAwG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self - host","credit_id":"64ede40a83901801021e426d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Schnabel","original_name":"Stefan Schnabel","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/aCXaxUC2uTJO1Rb0Lak7qVS5S7O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Siani","credit_id":"64ede41883901800e5d184be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3260834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thano Rama","original_name":"Thano Rama","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Paolo","credit_id":"64ede42506f98400ae4ac702","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidia Vana","original_name":"Lidia Vana","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"old woman","credit_id":"64ede432594c9400e261776a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christy Cummins","original_name":"Christy Cummins","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gina","credit_id":"64ede440c613ce014dfde09a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3873264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Cavaleri","original_name":"Raymond Cavaleri","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Giulio","credit_id":"64ede44d83901801021e4283","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Dark","original_name":"Christopher Dark","popularity":0.4467,"profile_path":"/6gcTasp92oHGwSahsBwAcpn7OWa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ainsley Crowder","credit_id":"64ede45d4cbe1201389d4bc1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicente Padula","original_name":"Vicente Padula","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":"/5xuUebpz2Wokmpr0E2AuZh2vubG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Waiter (as Vincent Padula)","credit_id":"64ede472e2bca800ff0ffb82","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69513,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joan Harrison","original_name":"Joan Harrison","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/nnZhx4Fh1yf9oqkPSrV9d9a6QlE.jpg","credit_id":"64ede4b2c613ce00eaaa72cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053989,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Neal Beckner","original_name":"Neal Beckner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ede4ccc613ce00c9f381c1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Wallsten","original_name":"Robert Wallsten","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ede492c3c89100aedb09a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Lloyd","original_name":"Norman Lloyd","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/z7jg1zuFfC5jqn4kI40OGAOrD5U.jpg","credit_id":"64ede4c0594c94011c380ee0","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Florey","original_name":"Robert Florey","popularity":0.3391,"profile_path":"/cRX6qkTniwyr1Kt0yTWIlqHO25F.jpg","credit_id":"64ede483c3c89100e361d53d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0508271","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1135,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WDhTW5UMjSuyaNng94Yx4K9nGV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1962-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
