Shalev serves in the Israeli army and has recently become very religious — Ori refuses to accept his brother as such and urges him to return to a «normal» life. On Shalev's day off, Ori takes him to the sea, where an ordinary beach vacation turns into a real drama. Director Elad Mukades arranges the events in such a way that the heroes will have nothing left but to talk — and try to hear each other.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ttLEdADBdDqvUQDQ03veXclz5QF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Talk","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avner Zion Jazz","original_name":"Avner Zion Jazz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3793e5f2b8d00c432ee7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ohayon","original_name":"David Ohayon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f379435f2b8d00c432ee81","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elad Mukades","original_name":"Elad Mukades","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee07b0c3c89100e361ddd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elad Mukades","original_name":"Elad Mukades","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3794c97a4e600ac3f8119","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ttLEdADBdDqvUQDQ03veXclz5QF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
