Ruchama Ehrenhalt's short film is set about the filmmaker's nephew, the son of her sister, a white American-Israeli woman, and her husband, a dark-skinned Ethiopian Jew. Around the age of three, the boy began to notice that he looked nothing like either his «light» mom or his «dark» dad. The film explores the phenomenon of biracial children and how skin color from an early age influences the formation of their identity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xqJh321aSYbbLyuDRkcEKaf0HJ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BrownWhite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ely Sanbata","original_name":"Ely Sanbata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f39a88700bf7011e36e793","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adis Sanbata","original_name":"Adis Sanbata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f39a8ecaa50800c8884138","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aderet Ehrenhalt Sanbata","original_name":"Aderet Ehrenhalt Sanbata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f39a963d43e00138f67b6d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mola Mekonant","original_name":"Mola Mekonant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f39a9c5f2b8d011b4e0901","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruchama Ehrenhalt","original_name":"Ruchama Ehrenhalt","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee022dc613ce00c9f38a67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruchama Ehrenhalt","original_name":"Ruchama Ehrenhalt","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f39aa4700bf7011e36e79e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xqJh321aSYbbLyuDRkcEKaf0HJ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Twin Cities Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
