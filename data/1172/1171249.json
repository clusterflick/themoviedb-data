Just a few years before her father's death, she began to suspect that this optimistic man, who taught her to find joy in each day, had survived the Holocaust in his youth. Delving into family archives, Mrs. Solomon investigates her father's history, which he had never mentioned before, while simultaneously uncovering the secrets and traumas of her own past. Over the course of 18 minutes, we witness the profound transformation of the protagonist as she journeys towards self-discovery.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ypqZc65XobPTCbv6u6IFxVHojsD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Father's Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515491,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Silvia Salamon","original_name":"Silvia Salamon","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f3965fcaa50800e952fd14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca-Elia Salomon","original_name":"Luca-Elia Salomon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f39668e0ca7f010de5057d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2087038,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariella Santibanez","original_name":"Mariella Santibanez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee04961feac100fe5eb5e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2087038,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariella Santibanez","original_name":"Mariella Santibanez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f39672caa50800ab73102a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289806,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manuel Lübbers","original_name":"Manuel Lübbers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511f1dc3a4a120139571162","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13793044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ypqZc65XobPTCbv6u6IFxVHojsD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bamberger Kurzfilmtage","release_date":"2023-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
