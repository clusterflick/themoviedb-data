In fact this may be the largest home layout ever built! This HO layout runs from Chicago to New York and can handle more than 1200 pieces of rolling stock. It takes a train 25 minutes to run across the layout. Along the line there is a massive steel mill and a 30 foot deep Horseshoe Curve-- two signature elements of Western Pennsylvania.  The Pennsy began in 1990 in a 2800 square foot basement. But then Jerry decided to add more layout space and more house and even a patio above. So the layout is now 3 inter-connected rooms with about 50% of the scenery completed. There are more than 20,000 trees on the layout.  This is a prototype-based HO layout with a lot of freelanced scenic elements. Creating realistic and evocative scenes is Jerry's favorite part of the hobby because this helps him remember special times and places from his youth in the late 50s and early 60s.","popularity":0.2556,"poster_path":"/dnJCuyupwvs29z2h7jONVdOUOkt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allen Keller Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Model Railroads Vol. 55","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Keller","original_name":"Allen Keller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Host","credit_id":"64ee7906e0ca7f00ec85d89f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Macri","original_name":"Jerry Macri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64ee791597a4e600c485c655","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Keller","original_name":"Allen Keller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee794acaa50800c885b7aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allen Keller","original_name":"Allen Keller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee795627167100ad3a71e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Hadley","original_name":"Dan Hadley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee7988180dea0139a3e4ae","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Hadley","original_name":"Dan Hadley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee799bcaa50800e950a6ad","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Hadley","original_name":"Dan Hadley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee79c277d23b00ec032234","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242012,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ollie Walters","original_name":"Ollie Walters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee79fe97a4e600c485c687","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Hadley","original_name":"Dan Hadley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee7a0d27167101006bd1aa","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242013,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janet Keller","original_name":"Janet Keller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee7a23caa508012b05454d","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dnJCuyupwvs29z2h7jONVdOUOkt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"},{"id":256087,"name":"trains"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
