He disappeared during the night of the Occupation, and his existence became a family secret. He disappeared from history, the small as well as the big: he is not on any deportation list, and the only archive where he appears is a family photo of him as a child. It disappeared like a stone at the bottom of the water, instead of going up in smoke in the sky of Poland. What did he become ? And why didn't anyone mention his name anymore?","popularity":0.4616,"poster_path":"/gFF1HGbVffGwxMCC4Glq011inL7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22945,"logo_path":"/zRDp1tYw2I5DtyHcAJHiBx6Xaii.png","name":"Quark Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":115837,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNC","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je vais tuer Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pauline Horovitz","original_name":"Pauline Horovitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee5bd23a993700e2f686e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gFF1HGbVffGwxMCC4Glq011inL7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":10941,"name":"disappearance"},{"id":161001,"name":"war souvenir"},{"id":220492,"name":"war trauma"},{"id":220657,"name":"war child"},{"id":237444,"name":"war buddies"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
