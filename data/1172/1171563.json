Each connection leads to another rider or another community creating a cross country path, and many inspiring stories begin to unfold. Indyâ€™s own story of growing up a mixed race kid struggling with self esteem and a sense of belonging, weaves through the stories of the women she meets, touching on the common themes of fear, freedom, camaraderie, personal permission and power. A vibrant and diverse picture is painted of women who not only drive their motorcycles, but their lives as well, breaking down stereotypes about women and women riders.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women in the Front Seat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542831,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maninder K.
