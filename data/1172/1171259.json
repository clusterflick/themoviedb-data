With the daily routine no longer needed, she decides to fulfill a long-held dream of becoming an artist. Ophira asks her husband to clear out one of the rooms in their house to create a studio, and she asks her friend, a renowned gallery owner, to organize an exhibition for her future paintings. Despite not receiving much support from either of them, she starts working on her art. However, it soon becomes clear that Ophira doesn't really know what to paint about. The film explores the refusal to age and the aspiration to understand oneself at any age.","popularity":0.1099,"poster_path":"/wgxoxmXMYY58NCNHlIkCjjXDvJb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Round Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Sivuv Shelishi","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gal Aviv-Kalderon","original_name":"Gal Aviv-Kalderon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3783777d23b00cb8732e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1764170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rami Baruch","original_name":"Rami Baruch","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/l7S4BYMUE7bwHBTxuQ4NABjMQEy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3783c77d23b010d6cf628","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1795248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Limon","original_name":"Dina Limon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3784177d23b010d6cf62e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ofra Weingarten","original_name":"Ofra Weingarten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f3784674507d00c5135487","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahar Shamay","original_name":"Shahar Shamay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee082306f984010c713270","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahar Shamay","original_name":"Shahar Shamay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3784f9e458600c6d01386","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665271,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Osnat Eiden Freiman","original_name":"Osnat Eiden Freiman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f37856e0ca7f010de4ff6c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hadas Klein","original_name":"Hadas Klein","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3785d97a4e600c487ec14","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10429056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/wgxoxmXMYY58NCNHlIkCjjXDvJb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
