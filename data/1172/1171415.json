As a child of immigrants and a queer brown person living in polarized America, Larry’s journey unpacks the complicated history of the Philippines, and its lasting impact on the Filipino diaspora. Ultimately, the film is a densely layered exploration of what it is to be American, and the legacy of the generations we all carry within us.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rHSTXIYJCsk0jgMSsXpy8toRDgg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Identity, History and Belonging","title":"Searching for Kapwa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Daguino Lariosa","original_name":"Larry Daguino Lariosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee640c77d23b00aebe128f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terrence Marcotte","original_name":"Terrence Marcotte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee6415caa50800e950a184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Daguino Lariosa","original_name":"Larry Daguino Lariosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee644497a4e600ac3d641b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terrence Marcotte","original_name":"Terrence Marcotte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee644f4b0c6300e1d30cf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7xKmhaZeVTmxj2qjtukZpdvNBl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rHSTXIYJCsk0jgMSsXpy8toRDgg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
