A group of women and a 10-year-old girl named Sorella are photographed as they are ordered to take their clothes off in freezing temperatures on a beach in the Baltic Seas. 80 years later, filmmaker Peter Hegedüs creates a dramatic recreation based on the photograph using new immersive 360 technology. He is aided by Ethel Davis, a 92-year-old Jewish Australian whose family perished in the 1941 massacre, and by the powerful testimonial of his own Jewish grandmother who managed to survive the Holocaust. To Never Forget goes beyond the depiction of a filmmaker’s process, revealing how the Holocaust continues to affect lives, families, and geopolitics today.","popularity":0.1872,"poster_path":"/gu3zoBggS2yzhKPTioDx9pABQOD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soul Vision Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Never Forget","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3141499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiara Kalmár","original_name":"Kiara Kalmár","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64ed5327e2bca800ff0fc799","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1632133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Stent","original_name":"Charlotte Stent","popularity":0.2323,"profile_path":"/kYIV5C6Tiicca4sFfF4y5Sa7Y1d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64ed533d06f98400ae4a91b0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Péter Hegedüs","original_name":"Péter Hegedüs","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ed534e45819900adaa937e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23546348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gu3zoBggS2yzhKPTioDx9pABQOD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Brisbane Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"To never forget | trailer | 83 min  Documentary","key":"fOibF9GstqE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-30T09:01:04.000Z","id":"64ed545ac3c89101007e5972"}]}}}
