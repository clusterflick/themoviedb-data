Price, as they document the handsome steam power (and the occasional pesky diesel) of the Grand Trump, Central Vermont, Boston & Maine, and New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroads. The mostly color and mostly 16mm production begins with the Grand Trunk in New Hampshire, then moves to the Central Vermont in the White River Jct vicinity, and the Boston & Maine and New Haven, primarily around Boston. Many wheel arrangements are featured, as is the passenger and freight rolling stock of the era ...including truss-rodded clerestory-roofed wooden maroon passenger cars on the B&M! So come along with Clear Block Productions as we journey back to the late 1940's and early 1950's to witness Steam's Final Stand in the Northeast in Vignettes of the New England Steam.","popularity":0.1676,"poster_path":"/d1H3pZJRE3dNqXZIlooCsCjBdR6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207374,"logo_path":"/24m9M3Q4M6YaLyDzJrxY72AekSZ.png","name":"Clear Block Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Featuring the Boston & Maine, New Haven, Grand Trunk, & Central Vermont","title":"Vignettes of New England Steam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Vignettes of the New England Steam","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241959,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Albert Michaud","original_name":"Albert Michaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee73d477d23b010d6ab01a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241960,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William P.
