Flam believes that art helps formulate and convey the most hidden feelings that otherwise remain unreflected, causing restlessness and anxiety. In this sense, the artistic form serves as a way to delve deep within oneself and holds a therapeutic function. The film by Flam reached the semi-final stage of the Student Oscars (2021) and was also honored with a special mention by the jury at the Bordeaux Short Film Festival (2022).","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2021-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As If I Am","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meitar Libi Flam","original_name":"Meitar Libi Flam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f39f1b77d23b00cb873b37","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meitar Libi Flam","original_name":"Meitar Libi Flam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edfdd3c613ce014dfde8d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
