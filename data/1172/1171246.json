Down With Antonescu! Down With the Death Penalty!","overview":"In 1942, three Jewish teenagers were executed in Bucharest. They were accused of distributing banknotes with anti-fascist slogans: «Down with Hitler! Down with Antonescu!» Ten years later, the mother of one of them writes a letter to the Romanian Communist Party in an attempt to clear her son's name. He was not even allowed to say goodbye to his family. Stylized in a retro black-and-white aesthetic, the film by the renowned Romanian director Andreea Vălean presents a monologue by the mother (portrayed by Katia Pascariu). Desperately trying to find the right words, she recounts the story of the cruel murder of innocent young boys, captured on camera.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down With Hitler!
