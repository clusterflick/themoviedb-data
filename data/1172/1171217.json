Filmed daily over thirty days for a future live art performance, Ginger sets up her experiments in-between caring for her mother who is never seen but is ever present in another room. The strain of filming every day whilst caring for a mother near the end of her life becomes too much. After a trip out to the pub and recovering from a dementia outburst, Ginger breaks down on camera and admits for the first time that she is her mother's full time carer and not the Hollywood creative she once was. What unfolds is the colliding of performance and the every day as the artist slowly loses her sense of self.  I Have Lost Myself is a powerful and disturbing statement on family relationships and responsibility.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The more I performed as my mother the more I became her.","title":"I Have Lost Myself","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64edee12839018013cdc1231","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241001,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edee30e2bca800ad0d85b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edee3e5258ae00eaa5dd89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edee4ce2bca800ad0d85c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edee5b594c9400c5553cda","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241001,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edee661feac100e16c2f22","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ginger Liu","original_name":"Ginger Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edee7383901800e5d18812","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7636832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
