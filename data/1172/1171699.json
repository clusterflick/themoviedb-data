Once they settle in the center, one of the children reveals to Marco that the classroom they are in is cursed: death will visit those whose last name is on the door, and they will likely receive a box. Marco becomes obsessed with the sound of a military jeep carrying the dreaded box and devises a plan to outwit Death.","popularity":0.3314,"poster_path":"/wscvTxp8oUDSNUyQGdJnGKl5W1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2023-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Names","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Iminja","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4243063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jakov Pavlov","original_name":"Jakov Pavlov","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3b8f97a4e60138952068","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragana Kostadinovska","original_name":"Dragana Kostadinovska","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/bfyzAXfLAzNJyv2wnMBJ8I2CzYL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3b9b97a4e600fea7f961","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4243064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgij Negrievski","original_name":"Georgij Negrievski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3ba4e0ca7f00ec863fd4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petar Caranovikj","original_name":"Petar Caranovikj","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3bad27167100e35e27f4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2129727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Ristoska","original_name":"Tamara Ristoska","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/qDZdB7xCwkoK0jJH9u5o5ADSDnt.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3c7ce0ca7f00ae387f6e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zlatko Mitreski","original_name":"Zlatko Mitreski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3c854b0c63011b2025c7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Stojanovska","original_name":"Angela Stojanovska","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef3c9fe0ca7f012eb1d263","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4243059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Spasikj","original_name":"Jane Spasikj","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ef3b0b271671011de1573c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531905,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dejan Dimeski","original_name":"Dejan Dimeski","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ef3b51caa508012b05b0b8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emilija Čočkova","original_name":"Emilija Čočkova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ef3b3e77d23b00cb8550f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ognen Georgievski","original_name":"Ognen Georgievski","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f0ef225f2b8d00c431c3c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emilija Čočkova","original_name":"Emilija Čočkova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f0ef1be0ca7f00ec86e964","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4keqMSFoUQ9kHzDSpOGynLhIBNT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wscvTxp8oUDSNUyQGdJnGKl5W1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1086}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinedays Festival of European Film 2023","release_date":"2023-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
