Using a camera, old photographs, and conversations with two other individuals from Psagot — poet and writer Yonatan Berg and artist Yifat Steinmetz — the director reconstructs the history of the place where, during their childhood, there were no fences with barbed wire and armed militants on the border between the two countries. He remembers how in 2000, at the start of the Second Intifada (escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict), the town rapidly transformed into a site of deadly conflict between two nations, ideologies, and religions.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jMKhtm0BTUXzsUtHFSB2Suop3ys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2021-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psagot Ramallah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Berg","original_name":"Jonathan Berg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f397e89e45860100305e09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yifat Steinmetz-Hurst","original_name":"Yifat Steinmetz-Hurst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f397ef3d43e000e1dcd982","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Binyamin Haneman","original_name":"Binyamin Haneman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee03fe1feac10138dc63df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Binyamin Haneman","original_name":"Binyamin Haneman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f397f6e0ca7f010de505cb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMKhtm0BTUXzsUtHFSB2Suop3ys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Asti International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
