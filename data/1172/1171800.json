Cameron attempts to repudiate the marriage, the only record of which is a certificate in the sunken wreck of a yacht, The White Heather. Marion goes to court to prove her claim and secure the rights of her son by Cameron, but is defeated. Alec McClintock, who is in love with Marion, and Cameron both want to recover the record, so they don diving suits and descend to the wreck. An underwater struggle ensues and Cameron severs his own air tube and drowns while attempting to cut off his rival's air supply. Alec then recovers the marriage record and wins Marion.  â€”AFI","popularity":0.3576,"poster_path":"/9YkXQecn6DJWfWuY1lvS0skI5Jv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Heather","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holmes Herbert","original_name":"Holmes Herbert","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/oCvbtPpsOEdrFLR6be8qkRfOZ3x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lord Angus Cameron","credit_id":"64ef8a19caa508012b05cb90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Alexander","original_name":"Ben Alexander","popularity":0.2743,"profile_path":"/9rei98OSExqKecusqft2BV5KR1X.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donald Cameron","credit_id":"64ef8a5bdbbb42013a224c3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Graves","original_name":"Ralph Graves","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/vqPuHyCXOw7MFtppvOW8wa9fC53.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alec McClintock","credit_id":"64ef8a974b0c63011b204320","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Ballin","original_name":"Mabel Ballin","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/1BHWwS9oA3sE2CnknHA3vbuzh6v.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marion Hume","credit_id":"64ef8ab84b0c6300c4267754","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilbert","original_name":"John Gilbert","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/wibrEasDmipryIht6W6ajxAAQgH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dick Beach","credit_id":"679480ba7660f09f3f486b9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spottiswoode Aitken","original_name":"Spottiswoode Aitken","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/oxtS8L2eigbXalqO9XDTPlz8YQA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"James Hume","credit_id":"679480cd08c1729ec918775b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibson Gowland","original_name":"Gibson Gowland","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/5peWO8JpDAgeb5NPGoOWvkpiyhX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Captain","credit_id":"679480db9481095651483a78","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Tourneur","original_name":"Maurice Tourneur","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/fPTadvsCrByQCskCqECxHIrpe2v.jpg","credit_id":"64ef8ae04b0c63013800c295","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010882","wikidata_id":"Q7774504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2201,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9YkXQecn6DJWfWuY1lvS0skI5Jv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1467}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":227147,"name":"underwater fight"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
