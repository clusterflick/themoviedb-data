I made it for the first film class Keith Sanborn taught, in 1978 at the Department of Media Studies at the University of Buffalo, when he was a graduate student working with Hollis Frampton. I was 17. The assignment was to make a film using one roll of Super 8 film, without moving the camera. The result is a kind of poetic/cinematic one-liner. It is in tune with the structuralist spirit of the day - to my surprise.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/o7kgs8cCXWPoVj5i80zT2sGLuid.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eve Heller","original_name":"Eve Heller","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/vowyir3HHg8GNMNd31OPcslxotp.jpg","credit_id":"64ef7c6d72c13e00e25ed884","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o7kgs8cCXWPoVj5i80zT2sGLuid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
