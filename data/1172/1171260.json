Settled in Israel, the Gutman family lives in a trailer park specially built by the state for migrants. However, the park is about to be demolished, with several trailers already evacuated, and the family needs new housing. To pass the repatriation interview, they need to present themselves in the best light before the relevant commission. In just four minutes, the director manages to create expressive characters and convey their fears and hopes for a new life with humor and a deep love for his characters.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Committee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koby Zislin","original_name":"Koby Zislin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64f376da5f2b8d00e12ba47a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hash","original_name":"Daniel Hash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f376e0caa50800ab730921","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Sorin","original_name":"Dana Sorin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f376e677d23b012e8b0a55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4249447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Pekar","original_name":"Isaac Pekar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f376eb5f2b8d00fef3ca95","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lev Brodinsky","original_name":"Lev Brodinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ee088f594c94011c38188f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793985,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alma Ben-Zeev","original_name":"Alma Ben-Zeev","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f376f63d43e000acfd6191","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hollywood International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
