Eighteen years after his arrival, his death left behind thousands of photographs and an impressive legacy that included a role in the founding of two great national treasures, The Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Appalachian Trail. However, throughout his life in America he was secretive about his past, with no one knowing the details of his life experience and his inner passions.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/efah0hOuSqtBAll8FDEEuae506t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonesteel Films Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He came to Appalachia in 1915 with broken English and little moneyâ€¦","title":"The Mystery of George Masa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Sayer","original_name":"Barbara Sayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"68c3430823af01306cd954c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1454347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuo Ichikawa","original_name":"Tatsuo Ichikawa","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/dsqMQDzf7Gj4xugdQl1mxEYKusp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"George Masa (voice)","credit_id":"68c3433f44423c328a6efdc6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Segal","original_name":"Bernie Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Horace Kephart (voice)","credit_id":"68c343776e06b48d2fd954c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Adams","original_name":"Larry Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Professor Seely (voice)","credit_id":"68c343e7238ef870672d2dc9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Barker","original_name":"Matt Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Paul Fink (voice)","credit_id":"68c34408238ef870672d2dd4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Lenz","original_name":"Bill Lenz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Arno Caranerer (voice)","credit_id":"68c3442a3a7d556ae3ffe9d5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco Palmer","original_name":"Coco Palmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Lola Love (voice)","credit_id":"68c3443b5164a8ed99d954c6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bonesteel","original_name":"Paul Bonesteel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c3427f05b9e787d3ffe9dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bonesteel","original_name":"Paul Bonesteel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c342aa09e53e2c64ffe9d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bonesteel","original_name":"Paul Bonesteel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c342e4f382c576acd954ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0389186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n9jH64z6s2syclAerc4doVu4KvB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.359,"height":593,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dH5KyyhZr3AxB4YAKlhhLh89HY7.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1992}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efah0hOuSqtBAll8FDEEuae506t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Mystery of George Masa","key":"518335778","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-01T22:11:53.000Z","id":"68c33c91f3dcb090fdd954bf"}]}}}
