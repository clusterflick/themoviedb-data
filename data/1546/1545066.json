Fifteen people died in the explosion, and another 130 were injured, many seriously. The victims were Jews and Arabs, young and old. IMPACT OF TERROR goes beyond the headlines with an in-depth look at how the effects of terrorism radiate beyond the immediate act. Film crews follow the survivors, and the families of the dead, for years after the bombing to discover just how deeply their lives have been altered. Award-winning documentary filmmaker Tim Wolochatiuk and producers Simcha Jacobovici and Ric Bienstock piece together images taken at the scene of the bombing, earlier photographs of the victims, and first-person accounts of eyewitnesses, to create a compelling and disturbing reaction of that fateful day. Heartbreaking and difficult to watch, IMPACT OF TERROR is nonetheless a timely reminder of the dangers, devastating effects, and long-term repercussions of terrorism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impact of Terror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Wolochatiuk","original_name":"Tim Wolochatiuk","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":"/6a7pnbdDoRXAQGcu2rE0tSATl8C.jpg","credit_id":"68c305c2c9b90846f106b888","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0800343","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
