Her one demand is to appear in the film via video link. What follows is a descent into cinematic depravity, as a seemingly virtuous charity worker becomes the face of a film driven not by art, but by obsession, control, and the twisted desires of an unseen patron. The film blurs the line between performance and possession-where fiction becomes a weapon.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Benefactress (an Exposure of Cinematic Freedom)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37533143","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
