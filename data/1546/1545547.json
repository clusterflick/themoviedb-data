Each of these protagonists embodies fragments of Antoineâ€™s memories and aspects of himself. As the film unfolds, the boundaries between him and the others blur, merging into one until the inevitable rupture of the spacecraft. Death as a second chance, a memory, a projection of the future, or a parallel reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gFDcXXiYwbinE6bQrszziQio0Xj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pastorale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Corriveau","original_name":"Antoine Corriveau","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c45d74e493b940b3e01842","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Leclerc","original_name":"Francis Leclerc","popularity":0.5169,"profile_path":"/aR9XLGBMwW2MKGI1MvnhpMcgda0.jpg","credit_id":"68c45d9e4ad18cc28222f807","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2276,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gFDcXXiYwbinE6bQrszziQio0Xj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
