Collectively, the films \"explore the faces of the Vietnam war that lie behind the fighting--those that must fight a war against fear, hunger, and despair. [They are] told through the stories of five \"faces\": a Filipino doctor and a Vietnamese child; a Vietnamese soldier and a Vietnamese villager; an American technical expert; a Saigon youth; and a Philippine Civic Action Group (PHILCAG) contingent\" (US National Archives). The film is hosted by an unnamed man speaking to a Filipino audience (in English); so the anthology likely was screened in and/or partly produced with the Philippines.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/a56RNhdCzzZrRzASzMPzwmNcEu7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79918,"logo_path":"/aRdHimsFTCuxhzQ0yG4yohKOxQk.png","name":"United States Information Agency (USIA)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":48551,"logo_path":null,"name":"GUGGENHEIM PRODUCTIONS INC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Faces of Vietnam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.","original_name":"Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/p2o92QAGXd7UijwjwupS3gPAV8h.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68c429e02e2f6f38442a088d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard T.
