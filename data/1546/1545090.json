Performances are conducted by esteemed American music director Tamara Brooks, a graduate of the Julliard School of Music. Featuring a mix of traditional Yiddish, Sephardic, and Bosnian folk songs, the concert demonstrates that bridges of peace can be built among people of diverse cultures and ethnicities. A BRIDGE TO PEACE chronicles the musical journey, and explores the cultural roots of the 60 years after WWII, and 10 years after the war in Bosnia. In the end, A BRIDGE TO PEACE renders an impressive message about the eternal beauty of music and the respect and richness gained by the sharing of cultures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bridge to Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Simons","original_name":"Rob Simons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c30ec8f4fc744e5198cf9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
