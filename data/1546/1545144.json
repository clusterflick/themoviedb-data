His early films captured the intensity of rural life of the subaltern people in various forms rich in anthropological diversity. Post-globalization, he started to focus on the decadence of the middle and upper classes and their servile submission to monstrous consumerism. During the making of documentaries on Bismillah Khan and Dalai Lama, Ghose's atheistic mindset evolved into comparative religion, which was reflected in the biopic \"Moner Manush\" on Lalan Fakir. \"Moving Focus\" is centered on Ghose's oeuvre, and presents the cerebral filmmaker in an insightful and thought-provoking way.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/a9hk05UppD9Nudxd6hlV27vnFeV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moving Focus","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Goutam Ghose","original_name":"Goutam Ghose","popularity":0.2125,"profile_path":"/fhWVf0QMFnuInxCD0VPl2HibTny.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68c3313ff6534c6908e974ef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2257140,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Niladri Roy","original_name":"Niladri Roy","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/x4IJASQPJanhWQpemLF89beGpLG.jpg","credit_id":"68c331608d2c8b31eea26aea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2257140,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Niladri Roy","original_name":"Niladri Roy","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/x4IJASQPJanhWQpemLF89beGpLG.jpg","credit_id":"68c331790d6eaac93f2bf504","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5684162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caesar Das","original_name":"Caesar Das","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c33201e3fb01f2a5a26ae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29703426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a9hk05UppD9Nudxd6hlV27vnFeV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
