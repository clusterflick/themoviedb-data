This documentary chronicles Elephant Gym’s journey, from their formation in 2012 to their recently completed “The World tour,” which spanned 23 countries and 60 shows. As the story progresses, we witness how the band gradually finds balance on tour, while each member confronts personal challenges and the ongoing search for self-worth. Spanning themes from individual growth and group dynamics to the global music industry and the challenges faced by Taiwanese musicians abroad, this documentary aims to portray the many layers of music—from deeply personal expression to its place in the international industry—through the lens of Elephant Gym.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Elephant Gym: More Real than Dreams -Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
