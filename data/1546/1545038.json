With their mix of hard rock, metal, and funk, the Californians created a sound in the early 90s that turned \"Everything About You\" and their cover version of \"Cats in the Cradle\" into international hits. They loved poking fun at convention while simultaneously celebrating the great guitar solo. After a few years off, the band returned in 2010 and has since demonstrated that their blend of groove, melodic vocals, and ironic self-irony is timeless. On stage, Ugly Kid Joe come across as a fun-loving gang, celebrating a loud, sweaty party with their audience, and that's exactly what we expect for Wacken 2025.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ugly Kid Joe: Live at Wacken Open Air 2025","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitfield Crane","original_name":"Whitfield Crane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7AsPD98K5X6j0HrKuRyOLANpEfE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Vocals","credit_id":"68c2fa4ce2761164679bdb6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5683868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Eichstadt","original_name":"Klaus Eichstadt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lead Guitar / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"68c2fa6a575a1efdb59bd8e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5683870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cordell Crockett","original_name":"Cordell Crockett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bass / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"68c2fa8d04dd0798a506b9b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5683871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Fortman","original_name":"Dave Fortman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rhythm Guitar / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"68c2faacc9b90846f106b82d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5683874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zac Morris","original_name":"Zac Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"68c2fae3b78b04eda24e7238","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/epPBvy3st5bu8uCnZRPS4DUoo9V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
