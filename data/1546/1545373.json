Parisian courtesan, Violetta meets the romantic aristocrat Alfredo and finds herself in love for the first time. She abandons her frivolous lifestyle to be with him but his father Germont, charged by the hypocrisy of upper-class society, threatens their future.  Internationally renowned baritone Roderick Williams plays Germont, and leads a magnificent and diverse cast including Susana Gaspar as Violetta and Thomas Elwin as Alfredo. This is not capture of a live performance but a new film production shot on location in the UK. Intimate, powerful and moving, this is a beautiful story of love and of loss.","popularity":0.1643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera Transformed: La Traviata reimagined as pure, intimate cinema","title":"La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
