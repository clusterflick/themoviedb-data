Johnson and Richard Nixon, and ultimately each other. The duo did so via their comedy variety show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, which in its two-year run on CBS, made a major impact with its political satire. The Smothers Brothers used the program as a platform to critique the Vietnam War and tackle other hot topics, coming into conflict with censors, who demanded cuts or last-minute edits to jokes, and fighting management to keep their material intact.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pfNQy8atNZi4sQwDBJFimrXDPsi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23,"logo_path":"/bJOFo2ufq7iFC1F4qZm8aLxF5aS.png","name":"Imagine Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":273927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Walk Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Dangerously Funny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Grazer","original_name":"Brian Grazer","popularity":0.3972,"profile_path":"/rNFUflKlpTEbnWDHd2Of293E4lx.jpg","credit_id":"68c3594bd336a1461f6efd74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065429,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Kruger","original_name":"Elizabeth Kruger","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c35967747a3298436efd77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Shapiro","original_name":"Craig Shapiro","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/hiQl2n9O8ErkgxcWwd2TR6yJfqT.jpg","credit_id":"68c35973a7b4bed11fa26072","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Shapiro","original_name":"Craig Shapiro","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/hiQl2n9O8ErkgxcWwd2TR6yJfqT.jpg","credit_id":"68c3597d93d9a83486ffc236","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065429,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Kruger","original_name":"Elizabeth Kruger","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c35987748fff49cfffc22c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233327,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Dan Patterson","original_name":"Dan Patterson","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c359ad73e4e59489ffc20d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Howard","original_name":"Ron Howard","popularity":2.8335,"profile_path":"/g3n8qduLaPO2l4kJZsV6xNMXozn.jpg","credit_id":"68c359ba58c71f0ecba260af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":428915,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeb Brody","original_name":"Jeb Brody","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/pPcnumg2o5Yj8iLArUNUsPyRKac.jpg","credit_id":"68c359ca93d9a83486ffc239","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1843156,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Babineau","original_name":"Sarah Babineau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c359d76e5fa7a39fffc239","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65702,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Alterman","original_name":"Kent Alterman","popularity":0.2361,"profile_path":"/hdXATGeoEyRzmz4eyHwYNjEt05N.jpg","credit_id":"68c359e40e8e0cb13fffc27c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2142747","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfNQy8atNZi4sQwDBJFimrXDPsi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"},{"id":380,"name":"sibling relationship"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":169086,"name":"political satire"},{"id":179428,"name":"censorship"},{"id":190458,"name":"television history"},{"id":208992,"name":"1960s"},{"id":358776,"name":"biographical comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
