While most television viewers in Columbia opt for variety shows and soap operas, citizens in search of suppressed truths tune in to Contravía to hear the latest news about forced disappearances, secret mass graves, and various other atrocities taking place all across the countryside. But when you live and work in the country that Reporters Without Borders claims is one of the most dangerous places in Latin America for a journalist to work, denouncing human rights abuses can be a dangerous game. Yet despite the danger to both himself and his family, Morris remains convinced that the situation in Columbia will never been improved if outspoken media figures like himself simply disappear into exile.","popularity":0.1517,"poster_path":"/kkqoaDGF9kG5lkk58Qr7agzeF83.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85595,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":52502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Foolish Earthling Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":112463,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Dolce Vita Films","origin_country":""},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2008-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unwanted Witness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2943963,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Gattiker","original_name":"Isabelle Gattiker","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634138a7e1ad790081fdb4ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604837,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ana Acosta","original_name":"Ana Acosta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634138ccaa7898007cc7582e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergio Mejía","original_name":"Sergio Mejía","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634138ba25b955007a8aafbc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1978294,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Ibáñez Díaz","original_name":"Carlos Ibáñez Díaz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634138de25b955007a8aafcb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan José Lozano","original_name":"Juan José Lozano","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63413890cd2046007f9f186d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380408,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Scotti","original_name":"Gabriel Scotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634139059c97bd00903a3930","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3720430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Hänni","original_name":"Vincent Hänni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634138f25b4fed007ae6b003","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan José Lozano","original_name":"Juan José Lozano","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5117a3c3a368751c00dce8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1286852","wikidata_id":"Q3546788","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w56ivVVBEGHCMMiUA8PiHwXZYB4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kkqoaDGF9kG5lkk58Qr7agzeF83.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":682},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiJp4Lkzn2UFig07Ivvdi6cMJ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1WEZ1TQ7oCh2zBo653KZFkuenLQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Nyon, 14e Visions du Réel - Festival international de cinéma Nyon","release_date":"2008-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
