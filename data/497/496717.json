The two meet again and fall in love in Hokkaido when Wang and her best friend Sugimoto Kanako are going on a holiday. Urged by her friend Zhang Yingming to concentrate on her studies, Wang remains ambivalent about the relationship, and is even more upset to realise that Sugimoto is in love with her fellow countryman. Feigning an engagement with Zhang, Wang initiates a break-up with Hasegawa and finds work in Singapore after graduation. Hasegawa learns the real cause of the break-up from Sugimoto in Hong Kong. A frenzy search finally leads to a reunion and a proposal in Kuala Lumpur. However, their love is doomed by a twist of fate as Wang must leave to see her desperately ill father in Hong Kong while Hasegawa has to leave for America to pursue his career.","popularity":1.1754,"poster_path":"/wLe0vHVRKoj4ykv3Y5h0oeucQ8l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":882,"logo_path":"/fRSWWjquvzcHjACbtF53utZFIll.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion
