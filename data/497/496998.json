Nancy says that pleasure in views, fragrances and sounds has been a political question since the birth of Europe. The idea of a landscape has nothing in common with the idea of unspoiled nature. Landscapes are formed in planned processes of afforestation, controlled and planned planting influenced by economic, health and other policies documented in the systematic and taxonomic languages of the land registry. Mapping the flora of the island, recording the resistance of the vegetation to the wind, and recording the sounds of friction I document the sound signals that reflect the changes, fashions or economic conditions of a particular location. These cultivation policies return to our houses and apartments like the wind, producing a complex feedback loop between interior and exterior space.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/u7klP7l7Qom8wpQO2q3YZ71mNNW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost Human","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Husman","original_name":"Anna Husman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a529cc90e0a2602750285d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":939,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7klP7l7Qom8wpQO2q3YZ71mNNW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":608}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
