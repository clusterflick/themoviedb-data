With the death toll skyrocketing from only two reporters killed in World War I to almost a journalist a week being killed in the last two decades, UNDER FIRE weaves together portraits, battlefield accounts and combat footage to reveal what the reporters see, think and feel. Martyn Burke, documentary filmmaker whose work has brought him to battlefields around the world, and Anthony Feinstein, the psychiatrist who works with journalists to heal the trauma, delve into the experiences of top tier correspondents from AP, New York Times, BBC, and LA Times, among others, bringing a unique understanding and insight into the psychological cost of covering war","popularity":0.5174,"poster_path":"/qQZwb4kjuXjBDiTUE4THfMoBnuq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under Fire: Journalists in Combat","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Journalister i krig","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15872,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martyn Burke","original_name":"Martyn Burke","popularity":0.074,"profile_path":"/fvDvW4hIOMWHEM1wlHXQLDQZcr4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bbbc3a368484e1970b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2172131","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.453,"height":159,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oOIVsm086qKYEKYlrNJ2R1E5FCg.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qQZwb4kjuXjBDiTUE4THfMoBnuq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tLNamLdv8lanBeMPklMouS5QAmD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":736,"name":"journalist"},{"id":18543,"name":"combat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
