They are moral conservatives who stay out of politics and the Culture War, but they won a record number of court cases expanding freedom for everyone. They refuse blood transfusions on religious grounds, but they embrace the science behind bloodless surgery. In Nazi Germany, they could fight for Hitler or go to the concentration camps. They chose the camps. Following two families who stand firm for their controversial and misunderstood Christian faith, KNOCKING reveals how one unlikely religion helped to shape history beyond the doorstep.","popularity":0.497,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":22078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Door Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fundamentalism and freedom meet at the front door -- The story of Jehovah's Witnesses","title":"Knocking","video":false,"vote_average":7.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Edling","original_name":"Jason Edling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"535482060e0a2656060054e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Thomas","original_name":"Seth Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5355375b0e0a26560300660e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Kempler","original_name":"Joseph Kempler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"535537b2c3a3681d98005a45","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gobitas-Klose","original_name":"Lillian Gobitas-Klose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"535537c9c3a3681d81005c6c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Shepard","original_name":"Tom Shepard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535521420e0a2656030064e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joel Engardio","original_name":"Joel Engardio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535521570e0a2656110062ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311806,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Howard Shack","original_name":"Howard Shack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535521840e0a2656060060b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311807,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jim Klein","original_name":"Jim Klein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535521b60e0a26561400614f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joel Engardio","original_name":"Joel Engardio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535537270e0a26560a006512","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479939","wikidata_id":"Q897294","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":3036,"name":"bible"},{"id":162685,"name":"blood transfusion"},{"id":197336,"name":"civil liberties"},{"id":200568,"name":"jehovah's witness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jehovah's Witnesses PBS documentary: www.Knocking.org","key":"Oj4cS4n9ZkA","published_at":"2006-12-02T23:05:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53552b620e0a265611006348"}]}}}
