This Montreux Festival show from 1976 follows on from the release of their album \"Black Market\" but features the line-up that would release their most famous and successful album \"Heavy Weather\" in 1977. This line-up features Joe Zawinul (keyboards), Wayne Shorter (saxophones), Jaco Pastorius (bass), Alex Acuna (drums) and Manolo Badrena (percussion). Previously only available as a bootleg of a TV broadcast, this new DVD release is fully authorized and has been restored to its full length.","popularity":0.1876,"poster_path":"/2vs7XOIGiGNT9BNJX6uvBQRRxtU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weather Report: Live at Montreux","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Weather Report: Live at Montreux 1976","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Zawinul","original_name":"Joe Zawinul","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/aD2fo9tIAciZJbDgl9Ke5MO4aNs.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"5a8840ce0e0a2653db05606f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Shorter","original_name":"Wayne Shorter","popularity":0.1485,"profile_path":"/eLKKoYCLVWrzMMEAkXR3cBFmkfv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Saxophones","credit_id":"5a8840ebc3a3682dbf0577a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaco Pastorius","original_name":"Jaco Pastorius","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":"/uBmp87gLkcOlqIu4NexgtHyPgr0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5a8841009251410a1f04e6e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Acuna","original_name":"Alex Acuna","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5a8841400e0a265453054e69","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manolo Badrena","original_name":"Manolo Badrena","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Percussion","credit_id":"5a88414f9251410ac404df5d","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Vk83NB5CU8r1PZQhvWcKMzpO8k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":792,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2vs7XOIGiGNT9BNJX6uvBQRRxtU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":529},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":807,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yaEt7tGAlfem7lETayYaV1pN4Vi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2011-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2007-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2007-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
