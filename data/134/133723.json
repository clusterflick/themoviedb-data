Noted paleontologist, archaeologist, and forensic physicist Charles Pellegrino is the author of Ghosts of Vesuvius, a fascinating look at this ancient volcanic eruption.  In AMERICAN VESUVIUS, Pellegrino uses the emerging science of forensic archaeology to decipher clues and gather evidence that helps him reconstruct the final moments of the victims.  Using the same forensic techniques, Pellegrino undertakes an investigation of the ruins of the World Trade Center. By processing evidence and interviewing witnesses, he illustrates dramatic physical parallels between Vesuvius's eruption and the collapse of the Twin Towers. His scientific exploration results in an array of startling connections between the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum and the man-made devastation at Ground Zero.","popularity":0.4549,"poster_path":"/fL1BlIjo3qU1r06rSyKQ15xEKFO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Vesuvius","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Pellegrino","original_name":"Charles Pellegrino","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62f60918f9183a007d970256","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Scott Alexander","original_name":"Scott Alexander","popularity":0.4503,"profile_path":"/2Zcnbxg4dLC0yRcv7NqcUrpZeCj.jpg","credit_id":"62f60934873f0000821caad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fL1BlIjo3qU1r06rSyKQ15xEKFO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1026},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/5XMP3338kufmjowl1ZTiMuCATJe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3347,"name":"volcano"},{"id":161304,"name":"9/11"},{"id":233278,"name":"vesuvius"},{"id":301339,"name":"volc√°n"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
