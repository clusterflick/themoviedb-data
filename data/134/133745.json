He has received many Grammy nominations, both for his work with the Dregs and as a solo artist. He has worked with dozens of famous guitarists of various musical genres, and been a member of the Dregs, Kansas, Living Loud, and (of course) Deep Purple.  These performances come from 1990, a few years before he joined Deep Purple, when he was touring with the Steve Morse Band, a trio that included bassist extraordinaire Dave LaRue, and drummer Van Romaine. The DVD features two concerts culled from the vaults of the German television program Ohne Filter Show.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/8mf802ZmNQi83dPhkdJwDMQXPdD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Germany March 1990","title":"Steve Morse Band: Live in Baden-Baden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Morse","original_name":"Steve Morse","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/wITbZzkX8C3G6OJ8HUsvpfiJepB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bbbc3a368484e196f55","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1KzlWz0KKy3aBmvqvPVoNGHfyBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8mf802ZmNQi83dPhkdJwDMQXPdD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
