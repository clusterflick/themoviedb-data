Left with no choice but to climb up a steel watchtower in an appeal to the right to live, the evictees were able to come down to the ground a mere 25 hours after they had started to build the watchtower, as cold corpses. And the surviving evictees became lawbreakers. The announcement of the Public Prosecutors’ Office that the cause of the tragedy lay in the illegal and violent demonstration by the evictees, who had climbed up the watchtower with fire bombs, clashed with voices of criticism that an excessive crackdown by government power had turned a crackdown operation into a tragedy.","popularity":0.4236,"poster_path":"/lWMarJDFV0hNPTz6hE7CYEqvIwz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50413,"logo_path":"/zhDMUPai3bhvqwVgckuJSK26G4I.png","name":"PINKS","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema
