Her relationship with her mother Pamela Matters (Aunjanue Ellis- RAY, MEN OF HONER), is far from stable and depicts the struggle between a young mother and daughter who both come of age...together. Sharp and candid dialogue blur the roles of parent and child, revealing a family secret magnified by pain and years of regret. Money's daily routine; a three-bus commute to the Catholic school she attends, far from her dilapidated neighborhood, to another world where she feels just as uncomfortable. When she befriends a neighborhood girl who seems to understand her, their friendship develops in ways that push boundaries.","popularity":0.4333,"poster_path":"/mLdwuyTW2pf7vfZge8uHlIqzI12.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Family can be complicated","title":"Money Matters","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1096518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terri Abney","original_name":"Terri Abney","popularity":0.194,"profile_path":"/p7WkBwGtt4smtQAVtpVK87rXuq1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monique 'Money' Matters","credit_id":"52fe4ba7c3a368484e193347","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor","original_name":"Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor","popularity":0.907,"profile_path":"/e54DfgDyS67xdtomYODFule6Ofa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pamela Matters","credit_id":"52fe4ba7c3a368484e19334b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Whalen","original_name":"James Whalen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lX6jcp6URBvX19NwYuO31ie47AS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bobby Lewis","credit_id":"52fe4ba7c3a368484e19335b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Richmond","original_name":"Ryan Richmond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba7c3a368484e193351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096520,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryan Richmond","original_name":"Ryan Richmond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba7c3a368484e193357","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2034741","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5qjetcIpNB0xmdKNxneHiKT4gEH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9fFUoJ1s6a8LfBy5On1MiD6CPRt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mLdwuyTW2pf7vfZge8uHlIqzI12.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
