The viewer is present when Neal is collecting his first ideas for the album overture, he watches the band jamming and recording and looks over the guys' shoulders during the mixing and mastering.  In addition, this DVD documents major parts of the band's story: Neal's last two acoustic shows with the band. These two performances were the only promotion for \"Snow\", because shortly after that Neal announced his departure from Spock's Beard.
