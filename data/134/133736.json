Hosted by Mo Rocca (a Correspondent for CBS News, a panelist on NPR's 'Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me!' and a former Correspondent for 'The Daily Show'), the film is structured as a road trip that begins when Mo makes an eye-opening discovery: The Constitution does not guarantee the right to vote, putting America in the company of Libya, Iran and Indonesia. Mo explores the battle over voter fraud and voter I.D.; searches for the Electoral College; critiques ballot design with Todd Oldham; and encounters experts and activists across the political spectrum who offer commentary on why our voting system is broken and how it can be fixed.","popularity":0.8356,"poster_path":"/56xojLQwQEMGd4nv4WVPI6wJ1b9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electoral Dysfunction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mo Rocca","original_name":"Mo Rocca","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":"/n9QMY97OY224sKLXHjlFLITdJJR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"52fe4bbbc3a368484e196ec9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1232251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Tancredo","original_name":"Tom Tancredo","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/bMnzQQVc2gMThUzkHvs0KRobuDP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6512496f68ff7000e3bd2d1b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie D.
