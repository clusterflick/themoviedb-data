The situation escalates when one of the stage drivers is mortally wounded; so the marshal sends for his friends, the Range Busters, to help him catch the criminals. Meanwhile, even the marshal's fiancee, the editor's daughter, turns against him in favor of an aggressive agitator for law and order - who secretly is leading the robber gang.","popularity":0.6788,"poster_path":"/hYhMbr4BsmQ5ASSHJwppiKBy5qR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Range Busters","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock River Renegades","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Corrigan","original_name":"Ray Corrigan","popularity":0.5068,"profile_path":"/iH9FM9CYHYcHWLuME0w4eKQgLFr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Crash Corrigan","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John 'Dusty' King","original_name":"John 'Dusty' King","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/20fVusFauZMZEk4jh3sU7xjenfI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dusty King","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Terhune","original_name":"Max Terhune","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/gHnWl1KSoJIMrHa3ezW8M2IEkdN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Alibi Terhune","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine McIntyre","original_name":"Christine McIntyre","popularity":0.2517,"profile_path":"/cYn5QyYfaK7HwTkUYsVH4qu5fxJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Grace Ross","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Weldon Heyburn","original_name":"Weldon Heyburn","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/gBttfAFxXmhwKLSoTET2R18tyqC.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Jim Dawson (real name, Phil Sanford)","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d61","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Elliott","original_name":"John Elliott","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/jm8Y332hX8swK7FpB0PcAIWQyrB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dick Ross","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d5d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kermit Maynard","original_name":"Kermit Maynard","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/zwP78rIGvc3JKGuqhzZdodU9FfT.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Marshal Luke Graham","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d65","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Ellis","original_name":"Frank Ellis","popularity":0.2555,"profile_path":"/q77hl9id06wVFF827PWHYalEajX.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Henchman Chuck","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d69","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Mathews","original_name":"Carl Mathews","popularity":0.0734,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Henchman Joe","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d6d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tex Palmer","original_name":"Tex Palmer","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Henchman Tex","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d75","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cramer","original_name":"Richard Cramer","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/7l1v1CPGqfi7lHvdj5Jpl7Tx8E9.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Bartender Henchman Ed","credit_id":"52fe4bb5c3a368484e195d71","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Bell","original_name":"Hank Bell","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/kJrAa6i3IK9I3AyNUOCRzuLh13P.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Bill Davis -
