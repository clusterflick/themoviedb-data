But for such a huge and powerful river, the Nile has been reluctant to give up its secrets. The Ancient Egyptians thought it was magical – a gift of the gods, whilst obsessive Victorian explorers endured unimaginable hardships in their search for its source. Nile reveals the true nature of the river and the reasons behind its magic – a magnificent and diverse mosaic of strange places and fascinating animals, stretching far back into some of the remotest corners of Africa.","popularity":0.6182,"poster_path":"/nYPNcFgjgR7VGzlPCs0Wkp4WRFE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon MacCorkindale","original_name":"Simon MacCorkindale","popularity":0.8786,"profile_path":"/rlNnpXapxZTw3LkNcqqdbJUki2Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"6260837aa5046e11e3db995c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gavin Maxwell","original_name":"Gavin Maxwell","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260838daf432400963ac454","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Scoones","original_name":"Tim Scoones","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260839de61e6d006620ef2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":499017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martha Holmes","original_name":"Martha Holmes","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626083b0168ea31558276852","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261875,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Mitcham","original_name":"David Mitcham","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626083c3af43240050d4164c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0418959","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nYPNcFgjgR7VGzlPCs0Wkp4WRFE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2004-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
