By chance, Pan Qing met a young woman named Zhang Xuejiao (played by You You). Zhang Xuejiao was being forced to marry by her family because of her age, and she was feeling stressed. Pan Qing's appearance smoothed the wrinkles in her heart. Over time, the two came together. This beautiful relationship ended with the appearance of Zhang Xuejiao's mother (played by Zhu Mimi). This is a woman who is eager for quick success and greed. She feels that there is no future in opening a barber shop and cannot make big money, so she tries every means to force Pan Qing to transform the barber shop into a pet grooming salon. At the same time, she also looked down upon Pan Qing, who was born in a rural area, and believed that he was too unworthy to be with her daughter.","popularity":0.2601,"poster_path":"/wKHjAtDRrKZZBQz5OB6g0WApb51.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Barber","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"牵过你的黑发的我的手","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Magic Barber","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2456788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zheng Yawen","original_name":"Zheng Yawen","popularity":0.1893,"profile_path":"/xlRohPjNfcuDZlO8NVDikQeZfCb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Xue Jiao","credit_id":"626136257fcab331cdf89898","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1135781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Chu Mai-Mai","original_name":"朱咪咪","popularity":0.5979,"profile_path":"/gL0IauNdoqdfI33gwLcvtb7Dtd4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62613637d1a89333681852d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":956575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Yat-Fei","original_name":"黃一飛","popularity":0.7591,"profile_path":"/eMpNYfWMxmIPWvDd1npajeDweI7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"626136417fcab331cdf898df","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3516749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hai Qing","original_name":"Hai Qing","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/8nUvKuasOxPBuydSS45TSenfwuk.jpg","credit_id":"6261368357530e0a723a314a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516752,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jun Wu","original_name":"Jun Wu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261369a322b2b00a10737b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4814452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o3qy4PiZvho5WoUHaA2kLMxUqEO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wKHjAtDRrKZZBQz5OB6g0WApb51.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJwSWYV23zB4sg2iIqbrUWGeTAP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9840,"name":"romance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
