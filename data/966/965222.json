Filmed over one season at this lush tropical campsite, the film follows the stories of individuals drawn to an unusual community, which promises both non-conformist values and, more importantly for some, a cheap place to live. As aging owner Morley and his residents prepare for the largest gathering of nudists in the US, the Mid-Winter Naturist Festival, they are faced with challenges both as a community and as individuals.","popularity":0.6335,"poster_path":"/yoGuMFSKYbjkeRqH9vUSXRSvWmL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135005,"logo_path":"/yHs7fh3S2JEDdYX5B0UrA5lSTjN.png","name":"Dorothy St
