In the film Eallin, we get an insight into her life through a warm and down-to-earth portrait of a proud Sami woman. She is the mother of Nils Magnus Tornensis, who went on hunger strike for 30 days outside the Storting during the Alta campaign. She herself has been deprived of grazing land during the development of the Guolášjohka power plant in Kåfjord. The film is about the violent consequences this has had in Inger Ellen's life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eallin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
