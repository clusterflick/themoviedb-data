Sent away for seven years to make money for their struggling family, they journey between seven cities from Philadelphia to San Francisco, and encounter Sloth, Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Lust, Greed and Envy on the way. As they do, they dance, sing, argue and withstand the sardonic commentary of their family.  Written and premiered in Paris in 1933, The Seven Deadly Sins was to be the final collaboration between the composer Kurt Weill and the playwright Bertolt Brecht. They had scored a huge hit together with The Threepenny Opera in 1928, but their relationship soured as they worked towards the premiere of the Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny in 1930.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/sJBXX76TKpCDFkb4Sw3eHoEUWBb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seven Deadly Sins - Opera North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallis Giunta","original_name":"Wallis Giunta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"626112ae322b2b00a106f365","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2624011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelley Eva Haden","original_name":"Shelley Eva Haden","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"626112b47caa4714b4d92b57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Campbell Russell","original_name":"Campbell Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"626112c3a5046e11e12f6690","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Laing","original_name":"Stuart Laing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"626112cb322b2b0051364ba9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Robinson","original_name":"Dean Robinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"626112d4a5046e11e3dde06e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Butterfield","original_name":"Nicholas Butterfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"626112da14956516538ccf1e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2425587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Holmes","original_name":"James Holmes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261127c14956516538cce45","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Clarke","original_name":"Gary Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626112a2d1a893009cab11f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sJBXX76TKpCDFkb4Sw3eHoEUWBb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
