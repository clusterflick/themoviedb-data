The driver, a young man, survived and did not even suffer any injuries. It's just that the wreckage of the car became a prison for him. Establishing contact with people crossing the nearby road also turns out to be impossible. The unfortunate driver begins to closely observe nature, which initially disturbs him, but later the world of plants and animals becomes close to him. Finding a sense of connection with nature, he can overcome a difficult situation and get out of oppression.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Potrzask","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923198,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzesimir Dębski","original_name":"Krzesimir Dębski","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/aFsxIgjJ2NM6ywdJk0XAyYou5NI.jpg","credit_id":"6724f43445b3ede8298c70b0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Józef Małocha","original_name":"Józef Małocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724f446b0c1d99c32651b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035053,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bogdan Rudnicki","original_name":"Bogdan Rudnicki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724f45045b3ede8298c70d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2884401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Weltschek","original_name":"Adolf Weltschek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724f45aa499cc2ef70508ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Józef Małocha","original_name":"Józef Małocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724f463a499cc2ef70508f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1986-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
