It entered service as a V-bomber with the RAF's Bomber Command squadrons in July 1957 with the capability to carry a 21,000 lb conventional bomb load - or an atomic bomb. The larger, more powerful B2 version, capable of flying 46,000 miles without refueling, appeared in 1960. Vulcans remained in service until 1984, after seeing combat duty in The Falklands, and until 1992 they were the star attraction at airshows throughout Britain.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AvpG5wcJE8weoRAyCuyfYbi1bp5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic British Jets: Vulcan","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761875,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alan Berg","original_name":"Alan Berg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62609cf1079a97006659037e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516246,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Russ Witherington","original_name":"Russ Witherington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62609d023d745415a5a1dbe6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516248,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Purcell","original_name":"Jon Purcell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62609d39fd140b00a4bc547a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62609d55d4cc8e0051a71d37","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2DFNDNU0OM0o8tx8Uux2IZpMvI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AvpG5wcJE8weoRAyCuyfYbi1bp5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfYNVuGo1RZepQtvamoXTSr6rv4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Copyright dated 1993","release_date":"1993-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
