It explores his photography, his relationship to the downtown New York art world, and the gay S&M club scene prevalent in the eighties. His infamously explicit pictures of the gay, leather, New York Underground were considered groundbreaking and made him a cause celebre. Mapplethorpeâ€™s portraits, flowers, erotic subject matter and artistic presentation, elevated the photograph to serious art, worthy of exhibition in galleries and museums.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/1w87JkMHw5YIxSgEzEz2pbMclcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Program No. 61: Robert Mapplethorpe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Mapplethorpe","original_name":"Robert Mapplethorpe","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/wTmG0z5gGD4l3tV5H0dPtuju7jN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62621218d1a89333681b725b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tschinkel","original_name":"Paul Tschinkel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626211cf57530e0a735c8338","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7904138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":921,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1w87JkMHw5YIxSgEzEz2pbMclcf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":621}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
