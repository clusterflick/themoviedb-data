While fearing breaking the news to her family, the young mother did not give up on her film studies, even as the baby girl grew. Gradually, the director’s work began shifting, resulting in a few short films focusing on subjects like pregnancy, marriage, and women’s anxieties before childbirth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/azIlqzvxyGYgNscwut0g8sLyBW1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","name":"Macao"}],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homework","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3007255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Io Lou Ian","original_name":"Io Lou Ian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626102b77caa4714b3419bd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/azIlqzvxyGYgNscwut0g8sLyBW1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
