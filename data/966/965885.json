It was one of the first American heavy bombers to survive 25 combat missions over the deadly skies of Europe.  In 2005, a Belle arrived in Dayton for an exhaustive 13-year restoration at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, where the Memphis Belle is now on display. In this locally-produced documentary, combat diaries give unflinching, first-hand accounts of the Belle’s most dangerous missions. Interviews with the curator and restoration crew provide insights into the challenges of their long mission to restore the Belle. It’s a story of two teams of men, separated by 75 years, who shared a deep affection for a plane that became an American icon.","popularity":0.0747,"poster_path":"/3NkbxfNIpWxPpVWgqebMhg202m8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memphis Belle - Her Final Mission","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Wonderling","original_name":"Richard Wonderling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261ce52fbe36f006a798188","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Wonderling","original_name":"Richard Wonderling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261ce5bd46537004f63916c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Wonderling","original_name":"Richard Wonderling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261ce6b14956516538f4904","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39231,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Jäger","original_name":"Robert Jäger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261ceb26eecee13a41522a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3517359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Lammers","original_name":"Mark Lammers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261ced7d4cc8e00a56ef261","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oBDUlRldLHZfu5U7lnf6AOtVTbl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3NkbxfNIpWxPpVWgqebMhg202m8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1416},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/nCl6CjzXgTPf7j2IOD93VkMsFmN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
