Shot on 35mm film in stark black and white, each woman relates her story in her own words. The bureaucratic settings for these short monologues recall the interview centre or airport immigration hall where the encounters originally took place.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire's Borders I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Chieh-jen","original_name":"Chen Chieh-jen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625fa29885702e00a5784e85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
