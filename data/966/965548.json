This year, he is determined to offer them an unforgettable holiday at all cost. But, as usual, his scoundrel boss takes advantage of his kindness to not properly pay him. Without the cash to pay for a hotel, Frederic makes a deal with his friend, Jean-Luc, the director of a luxury resort in the South of France. The secret agreement between the two is simple: one day of work for one day at the resort. Frederic will have to handle the most outrageous and despicable tasks in order to keep the resort running smoothly, and all this, far from his wife and son who are unaware of the deal. What follows is both hysterical and horrifying as Jean-Luc attempts to seduce Fredric’s wife and Fredric finds himself in the most hilariously, preposterous positions. Will someone come to his rescue to save their vacation…and his marriage?","popularity":0.3298,"poster_path":"/8wGkUEfEaydo3uFJCyP3nlPCes4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218517,"logo_path":"/bFDgSS9tXB7bqheGDKpzbql8IXj.png","name":"Charlotte Russe
