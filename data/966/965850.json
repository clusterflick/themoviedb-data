I picked one of these, a blood pond, to create my image of animation. There is a heaven and hell in everyone’s mind and I think that people dance because we feel heaven and hell inside ourselves. I made many of the images using a kids’ graphic computer called “My First Sony,” which was very easy to use, and I edited these graphics into animation by using a Sony Handicam V-88 in its animation function.\" - Tamami Asada","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Place Where Dance Was Born","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3517255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamami Asada","original_name":"Tamami Asada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6261bb5ed4cc8e0051aa9d98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
