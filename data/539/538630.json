One, named O-Tiyo, was a hard worker, she did everything around the house, fetched water, watered plants, carried firewood. And the other girl, O-Hana, was just sleeping, relaxing and enjoying life. And one winter the lazy woman wanted strawberries. They kicked the hard worker out into the street so she could get the desired berries. The girl was helped by a kind old mountain spirit - he created summer in the middle of winter so that O-Chiyo could pick strawberries for her sister. But she suddenly developed a new quirk - to try blue strawberries. Once again O-Chiyo was sent into the forest, and again the old spirit helped her find strawberries. But when O-Hana and her mother ate blue berries, they... turned into foxes. Based on a Japanese folk tale.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/iY2MGEBXNt1z0kI5sUCfptGjElr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strawberries Under the Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1282416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Golovanova","original_name":"Наталия Голованова","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/pq7lphwusm7balETr2NtP4Zupt3.jpg","credit_id":"64c171dd871b3400c74662cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1282416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nataliya Golovanova","original_name":"Наталия Голованова","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/pq7lphwusm7balETr2NtP4Zupt3.jpg","credit_id":"64c171d8db4ed6011ed7482a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7166152","wikidata_id":"Q16514535","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iY2MGEBXNt1z0kI5sUCfptGjElr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
