He is an only child and his father died five years ago. He is fed up with the boring life in his town and drowning in the love of Erzsike (45), his mother.  He gets his draft-call from the Ukrainian National Guard, to fight the separatist. He could sneak out of the country to escape the military service just like his fellows did, but instead he chooses to go to the war 1,500 km away – why? He is not a patriot. He is not even Ukrainian.  Combining visuals of cinema verité and mobile footage of war, Jani’s coming-of-age story unfolds throughout the nine months of military service and a few months after discharge.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/b5HXmy5dsTbM71hSKcXr6pgWwsI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116823,"logo_path":null,"name":"ELF Pictures","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":62358,"logo_path":"/namTJTqWjO2R92SKl8VLcXmhTAp.png","name":"Boddah","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2018-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Month War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"János Lelics","original_name":"János Lelics","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5b9756925141522e005704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erzsébet Lelics","original_name":"Erzsébet Lelics","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5b97720e0a262e8d00621f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zsanett Pál","original_name":"Zsanett Pál","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5b977bc3a3684221006cbd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093684,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zágon Nagy","original_name":"Zágon Nagy","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z95X5u1V2ms7JPIHL3XANyaGdHD.jpg","credit_id":"5b5b96ab92514152340053f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"András Pires Muhi","original_name":"András Pires Muhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5b96e7925141523700551c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093685,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ágnes Horváth-Szabó","original_name":"Ágnes Horváth-Szabó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5b96ce0e0a262e92006039","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Csuja","original_name":"László Csuja","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5b968a0e0a262e950061c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7526964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wjcV0frNklUcBsJjonuhj4WSzMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5HXmy5dsTbM71hSKcXr6pgWwsI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
