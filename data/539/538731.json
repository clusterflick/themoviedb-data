For example when there is a masquerade ball. Indeed wearing flea-ridden rags might just mean having donned a costume. This is what happens to two resourceful Brussels bums, La Cloche and Picolard, who manage to gain entry in a fancy-dress ball. Once there, La Cloche is mistaken by an oriental prince for a respected doctor. His mission will be to give care to a music-hall diva. Even more exciting, he is asked to vaccinate a whole troupe of showgirls. Trouble guaranteed.","popularity":0.2212,"poster_path":"/AqF2GZElw5vrAiAjT1gPQLzq4Ua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agence Centrale
