One fine day,opportunity knocks: his brother has just died;would you believe it,he made a fortune in America ,and our canteen man is the sole legatee: 100 million bucks. Overnight,his life (and his wife's ) change:not only his mates tell him stories to make his heart bleed to get some dough,but two aristocrats,a marquis and an earl,short of the readies,want the canteen man's daughter, a wise girl in love with a deserving young lawyer doing his military service,to become their daughter-in-law ,and to latch on to the girl's dowry.","popularity":0.1693,"poster_path":"/xf01UVLnRuvvhLPoiT17pF89wo9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonial
