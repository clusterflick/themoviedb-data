In the evening, he joins his wife in their dingy apartment, and together they reminisce about their son, a student in Minsk they rarely see. Possibly their only excitement of the week is buying a lottery ticket, which, for a few seconds, gives them a chance to dream. Yuliya Shatun’s camera, at first oddly focused on the white expanses along every roadside, then begins to scrutinise the teacher in his comings and goings – a precise recording with, however, a hint of the moroseness of a terrain so rare in today’s cinema. The teacher has stoically adapted to a degenerate world and a life fuelled by stifled shame. An odour of neglect wafts between the apartment blocks, the uttered words and the background noise of the television. A certain irony floats in the air too, and it needs Yuliya Shatun’s patience to grasp and take responsibility for it.","popularity":0.1133,"poster_path":"/A2Pj5sDLcUzCJthh5qU7QWeJRL9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2017-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434989,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anatoliy Shatun","original_name":"Anatoliy Shatun","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd37edcc277c0012e27dcc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2457783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oksana Shatun","original_name":"Oksana Shatun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd37fab76cbb00117464b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Shatun","original_name":"Alexey Shatun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd3807cc277c0017e28651","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Alexandrov","original_name":"Nikita Alexandrov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd38141d78f20014270610","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2230453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shatun","original_name":"Yuliya Shatun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zTyqf1lWGWntcWaoDiYW7Icz74R.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd381ecc277c0017e28673","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2457784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yana Taratun","original_name":"Yana Taratun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5dcd3828cc277c0017e28685","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2230453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shatun","original_name":"Yuliya Shatun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zTyqf1lWGWntcWaoDiYW7Icz74R.jpg","credit_id":"5c51d0fb0e0a2612ccd026ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2230453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shatun","original_name":"Yuliya Shatun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zTyqf1lWGWntcWaoDiYW7Icz74R.jpg","credit_id":"5cbffb7b9251410671fc51b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2230453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shatun","original_name":"Yuliya Shatun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zTyqf1lWGWntcWaoDiYW7Icz74R.jpg","credit_id":"5dcd3840b76cbb00117464fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Alexandrov","original_name":"Nikita Alexandrov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dcd384d1d78f200142707f7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2230453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Shatun","original_name":"Yuliya Shatun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zTyqf1lWGWntcWaoDiYW7Icz74R.jpg","credit_id":"5dcd3860e263bb001372e377","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2432989,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Gavrilenko","original_name":"Max Gavrilenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3f7cc28723c00204a1c3d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7626468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jE5fYEvru2uWHYS7emdnrQft0S4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1560},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gwWRRGqFJmsiRZnctzuPt6Nvfrk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A2Pj5sDLcUzCJthh5qU7QWeJRL9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Заўтра\" Юлія Шатун /  \"Next Day\" Yulia Shatun","key":"AfDYAYyHr0o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-02T21:14:02.000Z","id":"5dcd388479a1c3001346fff5"}]}}}
