Despite being women of different ages and professions, they understand one another with no need for words. They are united by the courage of having faced the hell of that violence, of having survived and also of having tried to give meaning to their suffering. And they convey their experience to other women and to society, without indulging in self-victimisation.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/O4jvbMe39YEkOGiqFhxPGkIXyT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertha Gaztelumendi","original_name":"Bertha Gaztelumendi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5e10dc925141522e02c9c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marino Pardo","original_name":"Marino Pardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5e1111925141523402b974","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertha Gaztelumendi","original_name":"Bertha Gaztelumendi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d77b80839549a001096ac50","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertha Gaztelumendi","original_name":"Bertha Gaztelumendi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d77b80e069f0e11343146c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marino Pardo","original_name":"Marino Pardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d77b81a39549a000f96a6f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/O4jvbMe39YEkOGiqFhxPGkIXyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
