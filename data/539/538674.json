Call it a colony. Call it a village. Call it one-world. Mainly call it a futile exercise in changing human nature, mores, culture and attitudes at any altitude. For t'ain't no time before clashing personalities, petty jealousy, violence and---that old demon---love create havoc. And isn't much longer before they become re-united in the face of an avalanche that threatens to destroy them. They all return to whence they came, sadder and wiser.","popularity":0.1416,"poster_path":"/lscppgSiA6eDRgMB9dMQki0ZMmU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transcontinental
