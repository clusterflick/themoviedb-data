She’s the restless spirit of a desolate and lonely place. Fethiye Sessiz, a notorious clairvoyant from Izmir in 1970s and 1980s, remembers fractions of her survival from abuse, kidnappings and violence. Recounting the events of her childhood through her diary and letters to her estranged son, Gulyabani recollects the emotional landscape in the most violent period of post-Republic Turkey, where the memory of the future and fragments of the past come together at once.","popularity":0.1703,"poster_path":"/faiGNDasCaz1ZO6HW82xAI7WBcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110736,"logo_path":null,"name":"29P Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2018-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gulyabani","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1987792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeynep Kumral","original_name":"Zeynep Kumral","popularity":0.2692,"profile_path":"/acAtrs2PinGSR9MIq4CSCTphgnM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gulyabani (voice)","credit_id":"5bd99bf6925141156900c822","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1855524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gürcan Keltek","original_name":"Gürcan Keltek","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b59bf6d0e0a2611fe01102c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8841486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/faiGNDasCaz1ZO6HW82xAI7WBcW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AcCYXDo9atAqKkVcoABV5U9MQws.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Aike1hWysfxxwO1re8edFYHB6H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":732}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
