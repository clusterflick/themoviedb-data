In fact Frazier, a crooked businessman, has urged an accomplice to impersonate Eusèbe, in order to obtain, through this straw man, authorizations for the creation of a casino in Sanceau-les-Nains and to make big money out of it. Eusébe decides to go to Paris to investigate. In the capital he meets Mariska, an exuberant actress who encourages him to try to get elected. As a result, thanks to her the true Bonbonneau becomes a member of parliament and the crook's accomplice is arrested. But Frazier is not impressed and, changing tactics, he starts manipulating Eusèbe.","popularity":0.1785,"poster_path":"/wfZqIUTGvNbVaaETtO2MtNRqqfX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deputy
