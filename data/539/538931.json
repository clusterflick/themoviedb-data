Set in a world very like our own, this Romeo and Juliet is about a generation of young people born into violence and ripped apart by the bitter divisions of their parents. The most famous story of love at first sight explodes with intense passion and an irresistible desire for change, but leads all too quickly to heartbreaking consequences.  Erica Whyman directs, with students from our Associate Schools playing the Chorus, alongside the professional cast.","popularity":0.6437,"poster_path":"/nNq3Vqa1z4Dlxmu3xv7Z1Gtyq83.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5845,"logo_path":"/5ncpOZ3B1Jlb7XnMJlBho1BHCIs.png","name":"Royal Shakespeare Company","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RSC Live: Romeo and Juliet","video":true,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Fishwick","original_name":"Karen Fishwick","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":"/5EPtroVK7NS5F1mDhJMEfklqPce.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Juliet","credit_id":"5b5e0054c3a368422a02b6b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bally Gill","original_name":"Bally Gill","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/kjlgABGFfYHwFmZwc7fBwckngMG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Romeo","credit_id":"5b5e0068c3a368422c02989e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seana McKenna","original_name":"Seana McKenna","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/n428lXKsHLtDIWrmugUeLyOQT1q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Nurse","credit_id":"6023c7b59979d2003ee4a2a8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2000702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katy Brittain","original_name":"Katy Brittain","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Friar John - Apothecary","credit_id":"678468002256023dfd4e5c59","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erica Whyman","original_name":"Erica Whyman","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5e007f925141522a02cbb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"5f8c779b397df00039575449","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7510244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e1AarlkuE6yiwebxuWTcc5R5Vg1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nNq3Vqa1z4Dlxmu3xv7Z1Gtyq83.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yaTTCzIDYkJZYLjCRkMUmESsHJF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/87kfboEcD40lSgvlYacSrY87vU7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
