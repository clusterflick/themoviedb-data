Carlos \"Kongo\" Mena, an inmate who has just been released, returns to the jail as Sarlo's assistant, providing his perspective, somewhat closer to that of the reality of the other inmates. Alberto succeeds in turning Carlos into the first ex-convict hired to teach at Buenos Aires prisons. For many of them, he is proof that redemption is indeed possible.","popularity":0.0885,"poster_path":"/m7wxmlI47UQN8MYV38LoLcc1M6q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cell Block 4","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Sarlo","original_name":"Alberto Sarlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5c1311925141523100d96c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos “Kongo” Mena","original_name":"Carlos “Kongo” Mena","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b5c131c925141522400e2ae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Gachassin","original_name":"Diego Gachassin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f04e6db2e074007afd4b58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Gachassin","original_name":"Diego Gachassin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5c1340925141522a00dbc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"pabellon4pelicula","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7wxmlI47UQN8MYV38LoLcc1M6q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246303,"name":"verseros"},{"id":246304,"name":"pabellon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
