Frank Glendon) wants to be an inventor. Then he wants to marry his childhood sweetheart, Hallie (the lovely Claire Windsor). Then he wants children. Then, when his inventions bring him financial success, he becomes restless, so he takes up with another woman. Eventually he figures out that the woman's reputation is less than squeaky clean, so he wants his wife back.","popularity":0.2518,"poster_path":"/gVJwpookaYzvs4GOM7yjEUOnjRo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70274,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lois Weber Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Do Men Want?","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Windsor","original_name":"Claire Windsor","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/n4YHwWfpRqTyMCPvblCpXRr2W3N.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hallie","credit_id":"5b5dfd4f925141523702b98c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
