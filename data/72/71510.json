He proudly takes us on a biographical tour of our culture from his personal library in the early 80's to what he saw the TimeWave project to 2012. Terence describes the Time Wave as his \"only original work\". The first part of this piece is the first visual description of Terence's unique theory. The second chapter of the tape astounds the viewer with the display of the the historical resonances that demonstrates how the last 4000 years are compressed into the increasingly speeded up, drawn and squeezed collective thoughts of the \"Gaian matrix\". Terence McKenna partnered with Sound Photosynthesis' media magicians Faustin Bray and Brian Wallace at the helm to create the visuals that dance and spiral with Terence's every suggestion.","popularity":0.4077,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Terence McKenna's visual tour of TimeWave Zero to 2012","title":"TimeWave Zero","video":false,"vote_average":4.167,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Terence McKenna: TimeWave Zero","type":"Alternate"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Terence McKenna's TimeWave Zero","type":"Alternate"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence McKenna","original_name":"Terence McKenna","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/9oSXQwNy9EjCQ6ONhohfNzKHlje.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4837c3a368484e0ee3c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563123,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Wallace","original_name":"Brian Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4837c3a368484e0ee3d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563122,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Faustin Bray","original_name":"Faustin Bray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4837c3a368484e0ee3cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2964,"name":"future"},{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"},{"id":10437,"name":"metaphysics"},{"id":2035,"name":"mythology"},{"id":10125,"name":"mad scientist"},{"id":11494,"name":"drug use"},{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
