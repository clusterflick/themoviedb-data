But one day the villainous Malaw killed the island’s ruler and deprived the Crown Prince Shiva of the throne. The insidious Malaw had the prince locked up in a dungeon in the palace’s underground labyrinth, and he announced to the Kiam residents that he would kill Shiva if they only tried to rebel. Then the Old Sage Swami, aided by programmer Agni, came into contact with the Light of Crystal. That’s what he called a girl named Parva, who embodied radiant innocence and was born of the same astral combination as Prince Shiva. Only she and her love could save the prince and bring peace back to the island of Kiam.","popularity":0.529,"poster_path":"/6wvyZKcdzH431V93Hf2rxcXuoU2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4753,"logo_path":"/v596rkvfJX3K6Ypgd4KHkzOhQrs.png","name":"Filmauro","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2003-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legend of Princess Parva","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Parva e il principe Shiva","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Dussollier","original_name":"André Dussollier","popularity":0.5342,"profile_path":"/rw3J5sNFr7VYvTKAPak9d14F7R6.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"564c5aab9251414dd100690b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Carré","original_name":"Isabelle Carré","popularity":0.545,"profile_path":"/uKyTfD7EMYuFl8fhyZ5JuPamT46.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Parva (voice)","credit_id":"564c5ac6c3a36860280069db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludivine Sagnier","original_name":"Ludivine Sagnier","popularity":0.8799,"profile_path":"/hd4fLjgtgNEidJOjuLNGfK1sOhm.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Lula (voice)","credit_id":"564c5ae5c3a3682a1a0017d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irène Jacob","original_name":"Irène Jacob","popularity":1.0465,"profile_path":"/yDpLjFtglSDlq3pvITr7O5AQfvg.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Parva's Mother (voice)","credit_id":"564c5b019251417c46005f61","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Abkarian","original_name":"Simon Abkarian","popularity":0.2123,"profile_path":"/rpw1AujIl0vJD6cyMDo2ykJ8rZA.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Swami (voice)","credit_id":"564c5b229251414dc4006352","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Bouajila","original_name":"Sami Bouajila","popularity":0.7001,"profile_path":"/xq8TMMCA4RI2omGxbPtLVsBMWX8.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Agni (voice)","credit_id":"564c5b41925141594d0016ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Sandre","original_name":"Didier Sandre","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/xR6wLnoawLAoh9pTHRcACKl2L2m.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Parva's father (voice)","credit_id":"564c5b6292514158f60019ed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zinedine Soualem","original_name":"Zinedine Soualem","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/feyQoQ89GDPnnmbeiiVFHkJvQtH.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Gangster (voice)","credit_id":"564c5b839251414dc4006365","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":560140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cubaud","original_name":"Jean Cubaud","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4821c3a368484e0ea87f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0347458","wikidata_id":"Q16652247","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1007,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bGDSZTbwhpp1oGRrXJE8vSwQbLK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1790},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYUTFSlDwC1SO8UICl4LQaC6VdS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2154,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/tYK8xq4JgNkl1Xai8ZU9Pucea9O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1436},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6wvyZKcdzH431V93Hf2rxcXuoU2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1434}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
