CNN, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other media outlets air special reports and name call anyone who questions the government as conspiracy theorists in an effort to suppress information. Yet, with the de-classification of decades-old documents, it can be found that many of these “conspiracy theories” are not so theoretical after all. This film takes a look at the government and media manipulation of an unwitting public, and plans that have been laid out through legislation, Executive Orders and Presidential Directives that pave the way for the elimination of many, if not all, of our most basic rights. Enemy of The State: Camp FEMA Part 2 thrashes out the mission of a police state and the implementation of martial law.","popularity":0.21,"poster_path":"/sH81fihFLRiyV262JKvmnkmHdWf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169746,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Lewis Films","origin_country":""},{"id":169747,"logo_path":null,"name":"BridgeStone Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Implementation of Internment Camps in America","title":"Enemy of The State: Camp FEMA Part 2","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex E.
