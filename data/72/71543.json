A dysfunctional family and delayed puberty make life miserable for a pre-adolescent growing up in Jerusalem in the 1960's. The film, an adaptation of David Grossman's \"The Book of Intimate Grammar\", shows our hero, Aharon Kleinfeld, striving to survive his domineering mother, his anti-intellectual father and his own diminutive stature in a setting of a lower-middle-class housing development where gossip is rampant and appearances are all important.","popularity":0.1367,"poster_path":"/bf8DC9o8aViILDN15YXAqQ9ymWF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Libretto
