Soll, the crusty old Confederate who owns the plantation and depends on convict labor to keep his farm running, takes a liking to Horace.

On Christmas Eve, as Soll becomes obsessed with his own mortality, he makes a grand promise... forcing Horace to confront his fear of death and the harsh truths of a decadent society.","popularity":1.5767,"poster_path":"/qg9gzYqONDAj79VwQ0VxhkhoTke.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Freedom has its price.","title":"Convicts","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Horton Foote's Convicts","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Duvall","original_name":"Robert Duvall","popularity":1.9616,"profile_path":"/ybMmK25h4IVtfE7qrnlVp47RQlh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Soll Gautier","credit_id":"52fe4820c3a368484e0ea687","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lukas Haas","original_name":"Lukas Haas","popularity":2.0985,"profile_path":"/6LNGu3o2aBiYNTDkbXMDIGyQtBh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Horace Robedaux","credit_id":"52fe4820c3a368484e0ea68b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Earl Jones","original_name":"James Earl Jones","popularity":4.0266,"profile_path":"/oqMPIsXrl9SZkRfIKN08eFROmH6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ben Johnson","credit_id":"52fe4820c3a368484e0ea68f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Starletta DuPois","original_name":"Starletta DuPois","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/pRa261QaUrK03ERYG26QHYCRP0n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Martha Johnson","credit_id":"52fe4820c3a368484e0ea693","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlin Glynn","original_name":"Carlin Glynn","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":"/jdyaS19SP8gdIUWuFQLbxmYRAeP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Asa","credit_id":"627c96745aadc40050ea3aa8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Levels","original_name":"Calvin Levels","popularity":0.1976,"profile_path":"/1TCMeq1uxJGOgsgM4YkPe4mcvB5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Leroy","credit_id":"627c968c7f6c8d0050d45cc5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Swanson","original_name":"Gary Swanson","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/vRFUumCw3SWpO1Al3rsgJ8Bloxi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"627c96987f6c8d00657d7602","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Horton Foote","original_name":"Horton Foote","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/nPDFOVkX244tGSJV2lmJA4bS5ss.jpg","credit_id":"627c96b1967cc7006777c90c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84050,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Eric Chambers","original_name":"Eric Chambers","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/lDxyJF1iNdretQ81HZMr7Ztdill.jpg","credit_id":"652b1ee1f28838029f324789","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Masterson","original_name":"Peter Masterson","popularity":0.1437,"profile_path":"/xNIV2DrSMBsxs1XRt0YBBKVnBul.jpg","credit_id":"54f070849251417974008099","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17766,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jill Savitt","original_name":"Jill Savitt","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/eXJToAVynOU2DYZYEyMhgFByg1C.jpg","credit_id":"644bd6ec51a64e088add5038","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957258,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dan Bishop","original_name":"Dan Bishop","popularity":0.2051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644bd6fb726fb10520062ae6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57709,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toyomichi Kurita","original_name":"Toyomichi Kurita","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":"/mOL18RHb2QGHDuOavgYTGRqH89I.jpg","credit_id":"644bd710fba6250582d5d96b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21611,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Rodgers Melnick","original_name":"Peter Rodgers Melnick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644bd723336e010517736b0e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14093,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan D.
