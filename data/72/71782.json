She feels oppressed by the strict religious island community and its narrow-minded way of life. Being the only girl in a big and poor family during wartime, she doesn't have much of a choice than to marry Paul, the beachcomber’s son. From the moment a regiment of Georgians are stationed on the island, Marie’s life changes and flourishes. With their film, music, and especially with their inventive, unusual survival strategies and entirely different life style, this isolated group of outsiders and in particular the young soldier Goga opens a new way for Marie. Through them, she realizes all her dreams without fear.","popularity":0.1885,"poster_path":"/yJZG4vFpbmTJBI6FGkSAbvl49xU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Aviatrix of Kazbek","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Aviatrix of Kazbek","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934438,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madelief Blanken","original_name":"Madelief Blanken","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/icXdaikg6kU7Syyu6laNNVAKSKj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anamaria Marinca","original_name":"Anamaria Marinca","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/9AMasU3BbXfncjXkmKOSxoqJaCf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"the Aviatrix of Kazbek","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Wouterse","original_name":"Jack Wouterse","popularity":0.3281,"profile_path":"/qQenSg4QLPdsLviQuBdTYuO0DWu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sallie Harmsen","original_name":"Sallie Harmsen","popularity":0.3942,"profile_path":"/he1zlVpW6hk2in30yEe8asDE4rF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kaat","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Poorta","original_name":"Sylvia Poorta","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/hJX0tbCuQRYdzjQZNUgmrWcnwUg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie's mother","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":934439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Paul van Mulligen","original_name":"Rick Paul van Mulligen","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/nnkrQHBn2BfHnfv0f2FA4UONWfL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10e3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":934440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lasha Bakradze","original_name":"Lasha Bakradze","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Indischa","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10e7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":934441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dato Roinishvili","original_name":"Dato Roinishvili","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Amiran","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":934442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zura Jgenti","original_name":"Zura Jgenti","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10ef","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kakha Kintsurashvili","original_name":"Kakha Kintsurashvili","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/fnffJidmgDmtfse2MNFdRdUFiyo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Irakli","credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10f3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lohmeyer","original_name":"Peter Lohmeyer","popularity":0.4116,"profile_path":"/1hnbaz9deXeNzCDwPxudTea17rV.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Bresser","credit_id":"533adba39251417da10061f8","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ineke Smits","original_name":"Ineke Smits","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4848c3a368484e0f10c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1234540","wikidata_id":"Q2017995","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":874,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yJZG4vFpbmTJBI6FGkSAbvl49xU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"De Vliegenierster van Kazbek - Official Trailer","key":"jMww1UvGdlw","published_at":"2009-09-19T08:46:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c2c3a3685448006c4d"}]}}}
