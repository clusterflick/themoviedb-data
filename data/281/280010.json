In this first instalment of a series about the police in the United States, Travis Wilkerson seeks to trace the early activities of the Red Squad section of the municipal police, under the zealous tutelage of its figurehead in the 1920s and 30s, William “Red” Hynes. Of him, we only see a face and a gesture, revolver pointed at the person photographing him. His mission? To track down, flush out and threaten communist activists. Infiltration and intimidation were the lot of this political militia purposely created to break any hint of social or political subversion.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/9tJVM9rkfp0eCiTCMZDvOxdddKx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Angeles Red Squad: The Communist Situation in California","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Travis Wilkerson","original_name":"Travis Wilkerson","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/B8v4cdOMPlSwblb9IFBR9BsMg5.jpg","credit_id":"53b4b3b80e0a2676cf000a2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tJVM9rkfp0eCiTCMZDvOxdddKx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
