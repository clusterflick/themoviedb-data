Although there are many tricks and ideas from Laurent Pelly, as always he seems to still retain the Offenbach magic. La Lott and Monsieur Beuron are a joy, but so is everyone else. The Patriotic Trio by the sea is both a hoot and wonderfully sung, the score seems truly complete yet never flags and the finale sequences for especially acts 1 &amp; 2 are a joy of movement and sound fused as one glorious Offenbachian moment.","popularity":0.1544,"poster_path":"/cS71eNX9D51j3ylzhO989V1KO1T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre Musical de Paris - Châtelet","origin_country":""},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"La Belle Hélène (2000) Théâtre du Châtelet.
