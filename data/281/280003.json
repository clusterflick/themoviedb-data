It's a world of circles - often seen from above: an espresso cup, a stairwell, the pills, and the records spinning. At the dance where the music plays, the rhythms evoke images of a butcher slicing head cheese, gears driving other wheels and levers, a combine churning out bales of hay, a butcher cutting chunks of meat for a stew, and boxers punching. The circle of music and life.","popularity":0.1044,"poster_path":"/8vFDcCmYSP87Y2CvIy4lp4eQ7T3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha – Studio Jiřího Trnky","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disc Jockey","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Disque-jockey","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","title":"Diskzokej","type":"Original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592966,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimír Malík","original_name":"Vladimír Malík","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627826e275f1ad00990255ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2458530,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Milan Svatoš","original_name":"Milan Svatoš","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627826f7a843c10051a604a4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Barta","original_name":"Jiří Barta","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/i82feETDaAkG1LNmXCDcPFZLrd7.jpg","credit_id":"53b4af07c3a3685eb40003b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1599481,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Věra Benešová","original_name":"Věra Benešová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654f5c1c5a5ed000c6ae4b5c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Barta","original_name":"Jiří Barta","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/i82feETDaAkG1LNmXCDcPFZLrd7.jpg","credit_id":"654f5be0d4fe0400fe0316e4","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Hybner","original_name":"Boris Hybner","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/AiyeMqkVZvewAat5PoAlQRMJZuy.jpg","credit_id":"654f5bcd29383543f3fce583","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223652,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jiří Kubíček","original_name":"Jiří Kubíček","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654f5c01d4fe0400fe0316f5","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351654,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Viktor Mayer","original_name":"Viktor Mayer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654f5c2c5a5ed0011e072317","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Petr Skoumal","original_name":"Petr Skoumal","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/tDVvirAvezEqB0z7rnVHMAzwv2D.jpg","credit_id":"654f5bf667b613013c4c386f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiří Barta","original_name":"Jiří Barta","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/i82feETDaAkG1LNmXCDcPFZLrd7.jpg","credit_id":"654f5bd65a5ed000e3f6d5c6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8vFDcCmYSP87Y2CvIy4lp4eQ7T3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" Annecy International Animation Film Festival","release_date":"1981-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
