Based on James Michener’s Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of short stories TALES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, Rodgers & Hammerstein’s own Pulitzer Prize-winning blockbuster was a landmark of post-World War II Broadway, a provocative romantic drama that beguiled audiences with a hit parade of instant standards. “South Pacific” reached new heights when, for one enchanted evening, Carnegie Hall presented a magnificent concert production with a dream cast headed by Reba McEntire, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Jason Danieley, Lillias White, and Alec Baldwin. Directed for the concert stage by Walter Bobbie, with musical director Paul Gemignani conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke’s.","popularity":1.4035,"poster_path":"/gFlHhhXCRuDd3WcxZcP9gqxl8ZF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Carnegie Hall presents a magnificent concert production with a dream cast headed by Reba McEntire.","title":"South Pacific: In Concert from Carnegie Hall","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Great Performances: South Pacific","type":"EN"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reba McEntire","original_name":"Reba McEntire","popularity":0.9357,"profile_path":"/q4T5XDHzVepqQi4NoqI9GKJcD3s.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ensign Nellie Forbush","credit_id":"53bdaf970e0a26158f002557","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Stokes Mitchell","original_name":"Brian Stokes Mitchell","popularity":0.4334,"profile_path":"/ga6mTDGIesmp6eMOEHI15grJFiE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emile de Becque","credit_id":"53bdafb90e0a26158500261f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec Baldwin","original_name":"Alec Baldwin","popularity":2.4905,"profile_path":"/hzKy7x574eeUS3wt1R3yvWBRpeR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bloody Mary","credit_id":"53bdaff90e0a26158200260f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillias White","original_name":"Lillias White","popularity":0.159,"profile_path":"/fIHaqkbqWzdXoiPM9KKwub7icWU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bloody Mary","credit_id":"53bdb0480e0a2615790025eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Danieley","original_name":"Jason Danieley","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/kgO8OnmyEayl1Cr3lPiCQOzkkIc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lt.
