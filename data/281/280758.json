His hobnobbing with the town-elite and social upper-crust at the polo-matches gives him an inflated idea of his social position, and he decides he is is moving on up. He breaks off with his girl-friend, true-blue Cynthia Brown, and hits on d√©butante Gloria Staunton, who appears to have an interest in being hit upon. Gloria's interest lies mostly in showing Marco that hired-hands who can play polo still aren't to the manor born.","popularity":0.4541,"poster_path":"/nVHLXyxI2JV0nmKSaCN4m7eq5LQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE BEST LAUGH OF THE SEASON Get an Eye and Earful of the Oakie Chin and Grin","title":"The Social Lion","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Oakie","original_name":"Jack Oakie","popularity":0.2535,"profile_path":"/9oWdEicbTjfpfiCtvvYuxi0UseU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marco Perkins","credit_id":"53bb2019c3a368661a0002df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Brian","original_name":"Mary Brian","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/ikRdqKBJ7UCAB1xNb67dVSYoOyZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cynthia Brown","credit_id":"53bb2031c3a368661a0002ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","original_name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/tFmOBk854vXe5dbeO9faNFPBy6j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Chick Hathaway","credit_id":"53bb2044c3a3686628000369","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Borden","original_name":"Olive Borden","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/nEc6Jg7pGdIbXzcAZub6a6apIiE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gloria Staunton","credit_id":"53bb2058c3a3686623000323","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Sellon","original_name":"Charles Sellon","popularity":0.2134,"profile_path":"/afTnl6HF8CV5SPjVniFDUMG8MtR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jim Perkins","credit_id":"53bb206ec3a368661a000303","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Ring","original_name":"Cyril Ring","popularity":0.1135,"profile_path":"/9Zkx8EGOSA0uVIC2RzsYePkZQha.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ralph Williams","credit_id":"53bb2084c3a3686634000370","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.H.
