Conlon conducts a skittishly dynamic performance of Don Giovanni. He relies on Thomas Allen’s tough Don to give the work much of its dark menace and on Holle’s terrifying Commendatore to provide the moral outrage – his job is to keep things moving, and he does. The exteriors – blank city spaces reminiscent of the paintings of Giorgio De Chirico – and moodily claustrophobic interiors mirror effectively the anguish of the orphaned Anna and the abandoned Elvira; this is a performance in which the two women victims of the Don function effectively as correctives to his libertine charm. Andrea Rost as Zerlina brings real delicacy to her role, reminding us that “La ci darem la mano” is a duet about her flirtation with Don Giovanni and not just a famous stand-alone moment. This is an admirable presentation of a fine performance.","popularity":0.1587,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":314831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Allen","original_name":"Thomas Allen","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/7CtZcvNyySzaCd5SKxULs7bSLNl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"53bbdc23c3a368661e0021fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn James","original_name":"Carolyn James","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/LWoRT6ihglSFDAXsdT9LyW3K14.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donna Anna","credit_id":"53bbdc36c3a36866380020d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Vaness","original_name":"Carol Vaness","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Elvira","credit_id":"53bbdc4cc3a3686628002152","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferruccio Furlanetto","original_name":"Ferruccio Furlanetto","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":"/hbElzVd6o6BjwQQW3Nop4TlbDph.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"53bbdca1c3a368661e002206","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kjell Magnus Sandvé","original_name":"Kjell Magnus Sandvé","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tuTwVU6wwapyGA54bag4HCEUyAt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Don Ottavio","credit_id":"53bbdc7ac3a368663b002083","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Rost","original_name":"Andrea Rost","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/cqIFmrAhCDVNRwIkybEWKVvplxt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"53bbdcb4c3a368662e002025","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhard Dorn","original_name":"Reinhard Dorn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/87VZZ0hCk0oXKRf6iHKRn5y7YKy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"53bbdcc8c3a36866380020dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Hölle","original_name":"Matthias Hölle","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Comtur","credit_id":"53bbdcdfc3a3686634002238","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Hampe","original_name":"Michael Hampe","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/rn7dnuMeZI4ZvZXjtaGDlN5e0cK.jpg","credit_id":"53bbdbf6c3a368662e002012","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"5686f0979251412e5201ee45","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Conlon","original_name":"James Conlon","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/mQYnpol3yV53snbqy7ZMVn8qfcW.jpg","credit_id":"5d6d88e965686e5b9b89ab19","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Montes-Baquer","original_name":"José Montes-Baquer","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6da7cb65686e091787aef1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Hampe","original_name":"Michael Hampe","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/rn7dnuMeZI4ZvZXjtaGDlN5e0cK.jpg","credit_id":"5d6dad34efcea900149bd679","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","original_name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/mM38EiXvY2Oi7cLrvXdT6j0S2aa.jpg","credit_id":"5d6da703efcea959189aa681","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0255953","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
