Mekas visited him briefly again in 1967, with P. Adams Sitney. The footage of this film comes from those two visits. Later, after Jerome died, Mekas visited his Cassis home in 1974. Footage of that visit constitutes the epilogue of the film. Other people appear in the film, all friends of Jerome.","popularity":0.2593,"poster_path":"/tVqcrvl0vPUN0vyPojhsIWEw3aM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes for Jerome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerome Hill","original_name":"Jerome Hill","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/uIp1oFFRs7LgjVFcnC4163QAD0x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1dd6c3aa3f007d0de618","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1ddfbd3209007ad0e31f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Mead","original_name":"Taylor Mead","popularity":0.3096,"profile_path":"/5UHc1T7cTParS6sfYKD3WBht2rW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1ded3a4a12007a6f6457","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Lafont","original_name":"Bernadette Lafont","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/eN4yXWW69DE0XpfKG09pziQclJ4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1df867dcc900828215a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Rydell","original_name":"Charles Rydell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1e11b234b9007d983e89","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704453,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Barbara Stone","original_name":"Barbara Stone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1e27c4f55200917bb3aa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noël Burch","original_name":"Noël Burch","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/2Xdgj46YjwBtx2qA0JR4Ru55yYI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1e68b0cd20009139c4a4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Malina","original_name":"Judith Malina","popularity":0.1798,"profile_path":"/nMXmUmvkavejiqWzNPicgG1IU50.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"638f8a4dba131b00aeb8e3e4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Beck","original_name":"Julian Beck","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/8bujAoKVLxTPvggUpDYSGfnKHR4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631e1e88b0cd20007d2b557a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
