For such an anthology the bonus features are especially poor, with a limited picture gallery and a DVD discography. The accompanying eight-page booklet does at least provide a useful insight into the making of the videos. It's also pleasing to hear the early and graceful instrumental track \"Erin Shore\" being used as the backing track for the menus.","popularity":0.7899,"poster_path":"/r4Lbkg0WFfaoWmMhHdy0k5iSPbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Corrs: Best of The Corrs - The Videos","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Corrs - The Best of The Corrs","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"THE CORRS THE BEST OF VIDEOS","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Corr","original_name":"Andrea Corr","popularity":0.3732,"profile_path":"/nQ4MZHLgG29Pze9BFLVdKtwPzkl.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c8dd8b0e0a26648d001704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Corr","original_name":"Caroline Corr","popularity":0.3844,"profile_path":"/3bCtusEbJDZcFQ5QWpF2J6yCVuO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c8dda10e0a26648d001706","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Corr","original_name":"Sharon Corr","popularity":0.2233,"profile_path":"/5XSul8S0pO5VAizIYTa4pAxL72k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c8ddb60e0a26648d001709","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Corr","original_name":"Jim Corr","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/r7a5VH55NFXE5XjXhh4zG00cx87.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c8ddc60e0a26649c0017e1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1603605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dani Jacobs","original_name":"Dani Jacobs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ab02f70b444006704b2f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Dick","original_name":"Nigel Dick","popularity":0.1864,"profile_path":"/h4xl94pqYfqCCtIrkgfxmxf4nXX.jpg","credit_id":"619ab03e0c0b380091a1e288","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Kahn","original_name":"Joseph Kahn","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":"/dukj3byVdRSHkpZKq2eOq9A7cin.jpg","credit_id":"619ab4001feac10023aa94a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22403,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ciarán Tanham","original_name":"Ciarán Tanham","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ab43867b6130094705ae6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Wickham","original_name":"Nick Wickham","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/6HijmbCHcoGotukrs3paoXVwa9X.jpg","credit_id":"619ab3dfc0ae360044f796ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Grant","original_name":"Darren Grant","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/a4FVdjvteNojdrGjVlE3rMGbh0R.jpg","credit_id":"63dd83b08741c400c7f1254c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yJd8nZjH1q5ljEPY7P24F8G5eTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r4Lbkg0WFfaoWmMhHdy0k5iSPbk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
