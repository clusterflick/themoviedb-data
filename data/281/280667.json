The film as you see it was constituted by dissolving negative emulsion in a chemical solution while recording the sounds of its own making. Through an extended, repeated looking, it functions as both an index of a disappearance and the remainder of the objects, techniques and medium which is now lost.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Points of Failure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338510,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Dahan","original_name":"Michael Dahan","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ba991bc3a3685ec1006f87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2952904","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
