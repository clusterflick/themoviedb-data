Yet in a 45-year career, Stanley Kubrick's films number only a dozen. That he strove for perfection is well established. What is less known is that he lavished years of energy on several films that never saw the flickering light of the silver screen. Through interviews and abundant archival materials, this documentary examines these \"lost\" films in depth to discover what drew Kubrick to these projects, the work he did to prepare them for production, and why they ultimately were abandoned.","popularity":2.5757,"poster_path":"/8Xh67HxSWCkfYRfLmvN5g3MsFrd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost
