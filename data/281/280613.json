Blue mists hover over the mountain heads.","popularity":0.1847,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1974-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canadian Pacific I","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Rimmer","original_name":"David Rimmer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ciCMjqhbFp2ruvNMuIhxUeni4qF.jpg","credit_id":"53ba13f6c3a368072e00395a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2333356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":160223,"name":"vancouver"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
