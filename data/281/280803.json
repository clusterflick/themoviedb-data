Meanwhile, a cop is searching for a means to bring down said gangster, who has always eluded arrest. The gangster's beautiful girlfriend, who's become a junkie under the gangster's nefarious influence, is smitten with the cop -- unaware of his profession and true motive for befriending her. Then there's a bunch of street fighting, some knives and guns, a guy who climbs over the edge of a high-rise, the same guy hanging out of the window of a speeding bus who then jumps from the bus to some hot chick's Jag, lots of striped clothing, and a red and black Toyota Celica.  The film was later dubbed in English and released by Champion International Films Co LTD as \"Billion Killers\".","popularity":0.2996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coliseum Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1975-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Robbery","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Plon Krung Sud Tai","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"The Last Robbery","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Billion Killers","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Rob the Last Time","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Plan Kreung Sood Tai","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yodchai Meksuwan","original_name":"Yodchai Meksuwan","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/ty7H83fAbJ9rqXoX1Gk3eU9UuOx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53bb96d1c3a368661e001d38","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wandee Sritrang","original_name":"Wandee Sritrang","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"53bb98470e0a26197f002678","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kom Akkadej","original_name":"Kom Akkadej","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53bb986a0e0a261971002715","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1336417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Runglawan Sripatimakul","original_name":"Runglawan Sripatimakul","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/8OHrniYdLcgdaInzVViXx7GwgO9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53bb98350e0a2619740026c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dome Singmoree","original_name":"Dome Singmoree","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"53bb9b6c0e0a26196e002662","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naiyana Shewanan","original_name":"Naiyana Shewanan","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(\"Nai Yen Ne\" in Hong Kong Release)","credit_id":"53bc8119c3a3684ce300029d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dam Datsakorn","original_name":"Dam Datsakorn","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c0ZcsJ7oE2wtNC6JeITCPg1WNKB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65029f7a5545ca00e1b0b5cd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kom Akkadej","original_name":"Kom Akkadej","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53bb97fb0e0a261984002752","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ai Nu Ma","original_name":"Ai Nu Ma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53bd8c4a0e0a26157600244d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15363,"name":"bank robbery"},{"id":191845,"name":"bank heist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
