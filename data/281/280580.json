Performers include Jochen Kowalski, Gillian Webster and Jeremy Budd, alongside the Royal Opera Chorus and Orchestra. When Orpheus mourns for his late wife Eurydice, the god Cupid offers him the chance to descend into the underworld and lead her back to the land of the living, on the condition that he does not look at her face. He sets out on his journey, but his path to the Elysian Fields is blocked by the fierce Furies.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/segUdMpoQKdkSOdcL4vb5mRRiVT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orfeo Ed Euridice","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Kowalski","original_name":"Jochen Kowalski","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Orfeo","credit_id":"53b99cf1c3a3685ec1005c32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Webster","original_name":"Gillian Webster","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Euridice","credit_id":"53b99d09c3a3685ea8005971","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Budd","original_name":"Jeremy Budd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Amore","credit_id":"53b99d1ec3a3685ea8005976","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Blanchard","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Blanchard","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Orfeo double","credit_id":"56b4a39e9251417dca001573","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Edwards","original_name":"William Edwards","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Amore double","credit_id":"56b4a8cc9251417dca0016a4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kupfer","original_name":"Harry Kupfer","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53b99d7fc3a3685ec1005c38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b4a11e9251410aab00242b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raniero de Calzabigi","original_name":"Raniero de Calzabigi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b4a16ac3a36806fc004a80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hartmut Haenchen","original_name":"Hartmut Haenchen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b4a17e9251415320003615","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Hulscher","original_name":"Hans Hulscher","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b4a191c3a36806fc004a84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256985","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/segUdMpoQKdkSOdcL4vb5mRRiVT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
