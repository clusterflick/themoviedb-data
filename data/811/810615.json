Or in that city that's the center of the world, what can it offer?\" What the five discovered there surprised them. AGIAN / MAYBE shows how something that seemed to begin in New York in 2003 in fact had its origins long before. AGIAN / MAYBE is a ping-pong contemplation, with music, of the five histories behind the whole, and makes a guess of its own at possible outcomes.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maybe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkaitz Basterra Zalbide","original_name":"Arkaitz Basterra Zalbide","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f1d500e64af00540d544e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkaitz Basterra Zalbide","original_name":"Arkaitz Basterra Zalbide","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f1da36f6a9900285f3cc1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkaitz Basterra Zalbide","original_name":"Arkaitz Basterra Zalbide","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f1d8623be46003cfa23a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Prieto","original_name":"Javier Prieto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f1ddb0e64af00540d54f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296871,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pako Ruiz","original_name":"Pako Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f1dc41130bd006c7d4a57","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0980932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
