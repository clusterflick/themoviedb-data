The lion is driven away as the library is set on fire. Finally, a young lion returns to the city that emerges from the ashes of the scene. Flowers rise from the burnt ground.  In this visionary and poetic video artwork the ‘hidden atrocities’ that take place in this animated painting are suggested rather than explained. It becomes a statement about a collective destruction of the environment, and of generational knowledge and wisdom passed through centuries and across cultures for which we must all atone.\"","popularity":0.1385,"poster_path":"/aFYSMUBBbV8d9Ucu6IHUUFfSNIU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Volte Gallery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929677,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aban Raza","original_name":"Aban Raza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"605c10083081310053ea6037","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167382,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Amba Sanyal","original_name":"Amba Sanyal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"605c1010a2d2e9002ae3aaa4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maitreya","original_name":"Maitreya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"605c10280f2ae1003d99825d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nand Katyal","original_name":"Nand Katyal","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"605c10313fe160006a0e0ed5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paribartana Mohanty","original_name":"Paribartana Mohanty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"605c1040426ae8006aa47641","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raj Mohanty","original_name":"Raj Mohanty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"605c1049cedac4003ce0d03e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3023965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ranbir Singh Kaleka","original_name":"Ranbir Singh Kaleka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605c0fdf89f7490054034ca3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5581,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elliot Goldenthal","original_name":"Elliot Goldenthal","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/9FOePwrekBTTuSSBmgVVeKKO8cR.jpg","credit_id":"605c0fed426ae8006aa47531","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2918420,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gautam Pandey","original_name":"Gautam Pandey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605c0ffa944a57003e26a498","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aFYSMUBBbV8d9Ucu6IHUUFfSNIU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
