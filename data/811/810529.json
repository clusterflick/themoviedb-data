We visited various filmmakers seeking to capture the enormous diversity of stories, realities, and sensibilities through the scripts they are writing. We get to know their neighborhoods and homes, and then we get closer to the ways in which each of them adapt the fantasies that have been born in their minds and hearts. In this way, we portray how they experience cinema and what would mean for them to make their film come true.","popularity":0.0933,"poster_path":"/zlw4pLlJwOIrbyMPDFhnOVIehFU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tani
