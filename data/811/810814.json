The story is interspersed with fragments of popular science films and letters from Yevgeni Zagdansky to his son in New York in the 1990s, creating a portrait of both the person himself and the whole era. My Father Evgeni is a film not just about the inevitable generational conflict and the pain of a father’s separation from his son, but also about the events of the 20th century, about people who read banned books, and about the Kyiv that shaped the Zagdanskys.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kEkN7hbl0k8Bh99VGWiQVdWZh6N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father Evgeni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Zahdanskyi","original_name":"Andriy Zahdanskyi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605e854523be460053997a8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Zahdanskyi","original_name":"Andriy Zahdanskyi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605e8553fd7aa400284e7a3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2165669,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Volodymyr Huievskyi","original_name":"Володимир Гуєвський","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/A7lE9KSfo0ZpLxTXOUyXHFK6eYI.jpg","credit_id":"665a14e944c59f97be752788","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1756633","wikidata_id":"Q3916287","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEkN7hbl0k8Bh99VGWiQVdWZh6N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA film festival","release_date":"2010-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
