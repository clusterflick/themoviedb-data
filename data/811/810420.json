Wardell hand-developed this film in salt which resulted in a shimmering pock-marked effect on the celluloid which emphasises the film's own materiality and physical precarity in line with the earthbound fleshiness of the maker's voiceover narrative. However, the salt’s implications as a curing agent for meat and the way its visual impact brings together threads of preservation – of his father's life, of their mutual love, of the detachment they have felt for years – and the latent imagery of these things hanging and curing over time, becomes quietly overwhelming.\" - Ben Nicholson, Alt/Kino","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gcGODRlRqGcfXzWmgNvxGdM359Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psychic Meat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Wardell","original_name":"Stephen Wardell","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60624b3f1b7c59003cdba68a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcGODRlRqGcfXzWmgNvxGdM359Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival 2021","release_date":"2021-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Transient Visions: Festival of the Moving Image","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Psychic Meat (excerpt)","key":"439824917","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-19T23:06:11.000Z","id":"60624b991130bd003e576519"}]}}}
