In this work Hoël plays a high-wire game with her fellow researchers Darragh O'Donoghue and Henry Miller, exploring the nature of their mutual obsession; filmmaker Stephen Dwoskin, whose life and fictive world bleeds into their encounter through a series of interventions in disconcerting and hilarious ways. Part interview, part therapy session, the work creates a shifting power play of fiction and reality, staging and improvisation, pulling at and revealing the nature and tensions within a set of real relationships.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acting Out: Stephen Dwoskin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philomène Hoël","original_name":"Philomène Hoël","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605dc098f3e0df007390ed80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
