With the repercussion of the declarations, the government decided to transform the retractions into a State practice. He started to torture opponents to make mea-culpa. Until 1975, around forty prisoners participated in the “repentances”, as they became known. Os Arrependidos recounts the little-remembered story of former militants who, very young, dropped everything to risk their lives for a cause, were arrested and tortured, and became a propaganda weapon for their enemies.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":"/mXaNdcEE6bvBcgm5hZ0X0Ko0eR8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78060,"logo_path":"/kx7pYjeFxOwo5Kxg4dd2zmr75x9.png","name":"Muiraquitã Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Repentants","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Calil","original_name":"Ricardo Calil","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/gjjLwOpLDQfJLbWf1Wiga4ntNND.jpg","credit_id":"605c6571944a57007509d2e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armando Antenore","original_name":"Armando Antenore","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605c6569140bad0075f80ad6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jordana Berg","original_name":"Jordana Berg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9WS1PuV87bYdmB2S3RNYHkzxoec.jpg","credit_id":"607816467a97ab0057c1e046","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1736482,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eliane Ferreira","original_name":"Eliane Ferreira","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/6Vw6VAyzPoCG9HN2dit3peU3C9m.jpg","credit_id":"607816892faf4d004196b2b1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287300,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Namur","original_name":"André Namur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607816aefbe36f0042892b63","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287301,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Loiro Cunha","original_name":"Loiro Cunha","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078166bab684900427f341e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908625,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carol Quintanilha","original_name":"Carol Quintanilha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078165518864b002cedc9d2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287302,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruna Machado","original_name":"Bruna Machado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078ecfc74645700588fc2e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2267167,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toco Cerqueira","original_name":"Toco Cerqueira","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078ed1b839d930040c3ce6b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pablo Iraola","original_name":"Pablo Iraola","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/3Uw3Nq8lLwLvqAFf5xlhY6sQ0Dz.jpg","credit_id":"6078ecbc5b370d00783ba5da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2267167,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toco Cerqueira","original_name":"Toco Cerqueira","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078ed25f48e0d0029f6ec0d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14464240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJjtTUwueUbVzYotRez0SSnvRVi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nhfaCsQTYnCxS7NBvu6z57Y5B3u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":905},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mXaNdcEE6bvBcgm5hZ0X0Ko0eR8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"É Tudo Verdade","release_date":"2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
