Every year, it is measured that Korean students have some of the highest test scores and a higher rate of acceptance into Ivy League schools compared to all other nations. But on the flip side, South Korea also has one of the highest suicide rates in the developed world, the highest gender pay gap of all developed countries, and the highest plastic surgery rate per capita. Always expected to receive top scores and constantly bombarded by media and messages that seem to demand nothing short of visual “perfection,” how do these individuals come to accept and learn to love themselves as they are?","popularity":0.5505,"poster_path":"/srGA4LTbFnwkSIExMG7cU5QvFw1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indie Doorway
