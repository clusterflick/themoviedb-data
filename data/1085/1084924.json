When we see her for the first time she is at her home, scared of the world that surrounds her. She is an observer when she watches her parents argue and other kids play. She has no friends and other kids often laugh at her. That causes her to shut off and makes her shy and afraid to become visible to others. But when she sees a classmate bullied by two older boys, she is the only one who takes a stand and causes other kids to acknowledge her. She overcomes her shyness and fear.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/sgbKZ8hvRg5N2GQxsFcff4BD2ZS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193083,"logo_path":null,"name":"artio
