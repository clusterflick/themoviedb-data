Uncle Kar, places himself before the camera for the first time. This nostalgic trip down memory lane, as he recounts his personal and cinematic experiences, from film criticism, experimental filmmaking to auditioning for Federico Fellini, cumulates in a brief history of Hong Kong cinema itself. Reflecting on the past 80 years, Law Kar's affectionate documentary sheds light on local movies and Chinese cinema, brooding over the socio-political transformation of our perplexed city, as the restless cinephile ponders the role cinema and art play in times of crisis.","popularity":0.216,"poster_path":"/c2T0p8LDKhtRVsLxu2JXMkkGlzK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2024-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"My Documemory","title":"Cinema Strada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3104448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Ong","original_name":"Donna Ong","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e41298fac502007c5a19d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Law Kar","original_name":"Law Kar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gU8EwIVpK3OIYVKuPIk4WZUiJMk.jpg","credit_id":"63e4128c7304b5008461bf9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":871,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/3L98b36qqlccKEFVL1sVrePGNtI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":626},{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/ers0Grk9Pu977aan5gcvA9v0naY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/c2T0p8LDKhtRVsLxu2JXMkkGlzK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"IIA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
