But this very public side of a very outgoing man was just the tip of the iceberg to a fascinating career extending back to the Jazz Age. The Unseen Alistair Cooke includes footage from 150 reels of film shot by Cooke from the 1930s on, recording his encounters with American scenes and celebrities. Discovered after his death, the treasure trove includes a short feature of his friends Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard in an exuberant playlet filmed aboard Chaplinâ€™s yacht.","popularity":0.1623,"poster_path":"/32i8Oi3oRtIy88OTqmnKmft4QFW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unseen Alistair Cooke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":199999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair Cooke","original_name":"Alistair Cooke","popularity":0.1296,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self/Archival Footage","credit_id":"63e498e065686e007ca679c7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Jardine","original_name":"Rachel Jardine","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e4990f65686e009d14af5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1278133","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qS5DgcBK9Mc3eBAVNA5itlkIPSv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":939,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/32i8Oi3oRtIy88OTqmnKmft4QFW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
