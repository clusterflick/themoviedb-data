Footage of the house feasts of a Tatar family intertwine with clips evidencing the destruction of the town of Shakhtarsk by the Russian troops in 2014, and with DIY videos made in 2003 by a girl imitating TV-shows. In the interaction with the TV screen the girl performs a fight between herself and Volodymyr Klitchko, followed by a weather forecast that recalls the geopolitical transformation of Ukraine since 2003. The video explores the refugeeâ€™s mental ecosystem, as it rises above interweaving roots of analogue recordings, videos populating social media, and rituals of private memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hhy67T2DPwhZZtTW80Fm6XZUkPf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weather Forecast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3912197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamilla Davlyatshina","original_name":"Kamilla Davlyatshina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e43929fac50200c34a191f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hhy67T2DPwhZZtTW80Fm6XZUkPf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
