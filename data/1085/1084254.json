Permanently influencing hydrochemical and petropolitical singularities, they give rise to xeno-disturbances, provoke pestilence, plague, and wars. The lord of the wind and epidemics - Pazuzu is the most powerful of them. Pazuzu feeds on dust, which, according to Kabbalah, is equal to the absence of God.
