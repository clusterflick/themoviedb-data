Their life revolves around hunting walruses and whales and protecting villages from bears coming from the tundra. This turns the film into a reflection on death. Marine animals become the food of people, animal leftovers are used to feed arctic foxes on a fur farm, human cemeteries become prey for bears. It seems that all the inhabitants of these places are involved in the cycle of food and death. The film departs from the usual rhythmic structure of cinema, being built on the principle of a shamanic ritual, a meaning-forming event for northern peoples.","popularity":0.3504,"poster_path":"/4SEYTD75VSNqOHq3XJrchso5gJE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piblokto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Piblokto (Arctic hysteria)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Shubina","original_name":"Anastasia Shubina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3cb898e2e000183a690fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timofei Glinin","original_name":"Timofei Glinin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3cb98cffeed012e50ba80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Shubina","original_name":"Anastasia Shubina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e5a0e7d29bdd00a086daee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timofei Glinin","original_name":"Timofei Glinin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e5a0f3d29bdd00b2f92116","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timofei Glinin","original_name":"Timofei Glinin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6806c4f2c5c8035fb08a4104","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Shubina","original_name":"Anastasia Shubina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6806c4fbc5c8035fb08a4113","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timofei Glinin","original_name":"Timofei Glinin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6806c50a6e1a769e81ee7358","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Shubina","original_name":"Anastasia Shubina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6806c5123f88854c49ee8ab4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27515295","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/egvJ6yobwoYC4kHtC4JpQi9xaEW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6HFypQVnM72X8v8vSGwJWqesXQ2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g2qOfqOMt5eOGnkSm46gFYWkFx6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqcpiuikGWq9u0MBUj9eZodKL7b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJa7G8hYTJQPiFliSMDuUYtpDmu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/wHsV5USBeSRvoEGTEksl0HPbWSl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4SEYTD75VSNqOHq3XJrchso5gJE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zrFLSeYumFaBxSWjg7ZWjsS7n0e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":241243,"name":"food chain"},{"id":287979,"name":"artic ocean"},{"id":290053,"name":"chukotka"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"},{"id":338182,"name":"northern peoples"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Piblokto | Artdocfest Open | IDFF Artdocfest/Riga 2024 | Trailer","key":"34D0YHH-AzI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-07T17:16:18.000Z","id":"65c3cb1c95acf001831d40f8"}]}}}
