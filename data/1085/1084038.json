Books are usually thought of as 2D, static, fixed pieces of historically relevant narratives – ReVerse Butcher wants you to (re)think books as contested spaces for possible intervention, creative agency, & rebellion. She sees books as multi-layered places where multiple meanings hide behind the illusion of being locked-in by consensus reality.","popularity":0.0867,"poster_path":"/gcsFyi036SDFYVPza8MYBXeECzY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trickhouse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Batteries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ReVerse Butcher","original_name":"ReVerse Butcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Poet","credit_id":"63e3978c5ca70400a7d36e87","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ReVerse Butcher","original_name":"ReVerse Butcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e397a51283e900aa86e668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ReVerse Butcher","original_name":"ReVerse Butcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e397b05ca7040093dbe706","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ReVerse Butcher","original_name":"ReVerse Butcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e397bd5ca70400a7d36e96","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3911291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ReVerse Butcher","original_name":"ReVerse Butcher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e397cfdb154f0085c821f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcsFyi036SDFYVPza8MYBXeECzY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1979},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2967,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRrmstEd17FuTqVTUpJjDehagzL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1979}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":493,"name":"poem"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":286465,"name":"visual poem"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
