We follow it as it moves between the natural and the artificial, from rocky hermitages to overcrowded contemporary cities, to the stratosphere where we meet Gaia, the creature that breathes cosmic air and feeds on the Universe. The winds are her circulatory system and protect us until, quoting the Apocalypse of John, the four angels close the mouth of the winds.","popularity":0.4207,"poster_path":"/xJkq4k0itozupes9nUMpCICouAI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fair Play  Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anemos","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Riotta","original_name":"Vincent Riotta","popularity":0.6577,"profile_path":"/3f5C77CbV5pvR98KQCwiq8fDPtu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3e131db154f0085c83729","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgia Würth","original_name":"Giorgia Würth","popularity":0.1728,"profile_path":"/q9aB0Bg8MoZ9KQBS7BDHV8K55Sf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3e13fdb154f00ded27187","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Fiorini","original_name":"Marc Fiorini","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":"/hHUyBrbdq5xPIoxviQ7hbXlINLZ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3e1497304b500c9f5ff85","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastiano Somma","original_name":"Sebastiano Somma","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/dui14fo0bk5fGvNc6gmN09xGf24.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3e1545ca70400a7d383ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessio Di Clemente","original_name":"Alessio Di Clemente","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/yq28XA1Xmqq6bg5IN8Mo9e001u.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3e165fac50200849f3853","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Guarducci","original_name":"Fabrizio Guarducci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aX9WpozHJDBiL3CFdnrDXqoAsHq.jpg","credit_id":"63e3e0897304b500c9f5ff4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184892,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paolo Marzoni","original_name":"Paolo Marzoni","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3e0b622e48000817bb6bf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14138,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pino Donaggio","original_name":"Pino Donaggio","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/726TMxralQqvrQZTW3PvMi9u9Z2.jpg","credit_id":"63e3e0c45ca7040093dbfe60","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Guarducci","original_name":"Fabrizio Guarducci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aX9WpozHJDBiL3CFdnrDXqoAsHq.jpg","credit_id":"63e3e0e67304b500b400f50b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Guarducci","original_name":"Fabrizio Guarducci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aX9WpozHJDBiL3CFdnrDXqoAsHq.jpg","credit_id":"63e3e06b7304b50078df2fe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194719,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stefano Spiti","original_name":"Stefano Spiti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3e0a5fac50200f330da5b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116397,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matteo Cichero","original_name":"Matteo Cichero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e3e0d4fac502007c5a0c11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12217088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1468,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJkq4k0itozupes9nUMpCICouAI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1056}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
