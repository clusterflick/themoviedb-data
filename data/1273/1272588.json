While he was alive, Schwitters provoked the art world with his one-man Dada movement Merz, which united painting, sculpture, architecture and literature in fragments. After his death he hit the headlines due to several sensational inheritance lawsuits involving his heirs, a mistress, the Norwegian government, and the Marlborough Gallery - which had gained notoriety in the Rothko scandal. Looking back on Schwittersâ€™ life and work, this film unravels a bizarre story of deceit, intrigue, power and money.","popularity":0.2033,"poster_path":"/86mC2Y3Z3J9EmwS9suKtQCwGSNE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurt Schwitters: The Schwitters Scandal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","original_name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/jOSkqBq9pJHz49P4906AdRMgGXl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6616a6decb6db50162a9df67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Sewell","original_name":"Brian Sewell","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/79AXcAOeZDcFhjpUS8XrDj6dOi6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6616a6ee77c01f017ca46c32","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1930606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Chu","original_name":"Simon Chu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6616a6d07a4ee701630a42f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0939549","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/86mC2Y3Z3J9EmwS9suKtQCwGSNE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
