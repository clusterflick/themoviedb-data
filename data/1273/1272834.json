In Blaine County, these dogs are primarily used by ranchers to protect Sheep in the mountains. Unfortunately, as a result of the way the laws are written, these LGDs are often abused and mistreated, with many being left behind in the treacherous Idaho mountain ranges, with little to no chance of survival.  Unega Tales of the Guardians, follows the efforts of Tiffany Larson and her team to change the legal classification of these dogs and protect them from abuse in the eyes of the law. Showcasing stunning landscapes, up-close encounters with the Livestock Guardian Dogs, horrifying stories, and conversations with politicians, ranchers and rescuers - Unega Tales of the Guardians takes viewers on an in-depth look at the beauty of Idaho & the plight of these dogs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mBon296x7If7W3879u3FiwxEYha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unega | Tales Of The Guardians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Larson","original_name":"Tiffany Larson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6619725066e469017ebd0822","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Jenkins","original_name":"Nicole Jenkins","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"661972574da3d4017c9266bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bean","original_name":"Brian Bean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6619725fb9a0bd014910e68e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Bean","original_name":"Fiona Bean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66197263dd731b01650a8fb0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Asha Stone","original_name":"Suzanne Asha Stone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"661972713acd20017c472c96","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Kaufmann","original_name":"Lisa Kaufmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6619727c109cd00165a3a7aa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4649571,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikola Lakic","original_name":"Nikola Lakic","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/u54QgtaWg2V6D80WVWf7VF83EdP.jpg","credit_id":"66196f773acd2001634695a3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4649571,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikola Lakic","original_name":"Nikola Lakic","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/u54QgtaWg2V6D80WVWf7VF83EdP.jpg","credit_id":"66196f8c3acd2001634695af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4649571,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikola Lakic","original_name":"Nikola Lakic","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/u54QgtaWg2V6D80WVWf7VF83EdP.jpg","credit_id":"66197019af3da6017c192613","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4649571,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikola Lakic","original_name":"Nikola Lakic","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/u54QgtaWg2V6D80WVWf7VF83EdP.jpg","credit_id":"6619702de4c9eb017c2b3548","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mBon296x7If7W3879u3FiwxEYha.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL TRAILER Unega | Tales Of The Guardians","key":"pWRIzaSJru8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-01T19:20:32.000Z","id":"661972ffaf3da6017c192785"}]}}}
