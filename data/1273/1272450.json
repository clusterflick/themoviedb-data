A young man appears, smoking and shaving in front of the camera, but his hair continues to grow so fast that after a few minutes his body resembles an animal. The film evokes the backwardness of the Soviet order, with elements of performance. The artist Jānis Viņķelis plays the role of the man.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":225773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eduarda Tisē Tautas kinostudija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyperdrom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jānis Viņķelis","original_name":"Jānis Viņķelis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66164ea2dc1cb401491b6101","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Egons Zīverts","original_name":"Egons Zīverts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66164e8bc68b69017b201511","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Māris Viģelis","original_name":"Māris Viģelis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66164e75109dec017b9de246","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
