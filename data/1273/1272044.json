For the married Aset and Indira, the meaning of this word turned out to be fateful. They make handmade ceramic tiles and put a piece of themselves into each tile. Their story is not only a story of love or joint creation. This is a story of connection and mutual support. The two of them gave up their regular jobs and income to pursue their dreams together. They are young and light, a new generation of young entrepreneurs. They do not build big plans and business with a million turnover, postponing life for later. Aset and Indira inspire to live here and now and be real.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meraki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4643314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aisha Salimgereeva","original_name":"Aisha Salimgereeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661537ce15a4a1017df87dcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
