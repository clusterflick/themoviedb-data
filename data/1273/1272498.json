It is a handsome, well sung version which stands up well to the contemporary BBC 2 version that graced our screens a Christmas or two ago. (This, too, was a Christmas-time, prestige production). The production and adaptation is by Václav Kaslic, who has produced the opera many times on stage: here he makes imaginative use of the new medium to overcome difficulties inherent in some stories. He has a fine cast, including Jon Piso as a robust Hoffman[,] Sylvia Geszty, Thomas Tipton and Herold Kraus. The orchestra and chorus are from the Bavarian State Opera.” - Brian Baxter, for the BFI.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tales of Hoffman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Piso","original_name":"Jon Piso","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hoffman","credit_id":"66166c8fc68b69017b2037a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1630781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Geszty","original_name":"Sylvia Geszty","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66166c9aa579f90185301222","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Tipton","original_name":"Thomas Tipton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66166ca3528b2e0163b417ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Kraus","original_name":"Harold Kraus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66166cb04da3d4018415606d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Václav Kašlík","original_name":"Václav Kašlík","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66166c80c7a7e0017d067f8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
