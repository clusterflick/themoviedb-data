These protests grew into what is called the 'Aragalaya' movement and thousands of people joined, expressing their frustration over many suppressed issues. One of their demands was transparency in the investigations of the Easter Sunday attacks which took place on 21st April, 2019 when a series of bombs went off across the island including at three churches claiming nearly 300 lives. Jehan Srikantha Appuhamy, a well-known Sri Lankan actor was also among the protesters. As someone who grew up having a close relationship with the church, Jehan felt traumatized after the Easter Sunday attacks. He began a walk for justice 3 years after the attacks, in a setting where the people were still not given answers as to what happened that day.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/nrvTuiPmDrRAGdP6uNuzwmjb6Q9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agenda 14","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cross of Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jehan Sri Kanth","original_name":"Jehan Sri Kanth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6615ceb45c564e017b803893","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121444,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anomaa Rajakaruna","original_name":"Anomaa Rajakaruna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66174dee4539d0017dfc3778","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":807,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrvTuiPmDrRAGdP6uNuzwmjb6Q9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":541}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"si","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
