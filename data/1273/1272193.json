Standing in his way is Ida’s authoritarian father Dr. Hampapa, who likes to shoot—not only—rabbits. But then on top of it all, a supposed naturalist commits suicide and everything becomes more and more absurd. A funny yet serious psycho-thriller that discovers the authentic in the crazy and vice versa.","popularity":0.217,"poster_path":"/6Qhr6gPS91jQ3k6m02ieA4ap33j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elly
