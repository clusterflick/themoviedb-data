Threats and adversity have never prevented her from decrying loud and clear the injustices that have kept women in submission in her country, Algeria. My virtual friend who was telling me about her fights and her life for the last four years was found dead in her apartment in 2019. This film is a posthumous gift to Imane; a way to repair this cruel twist of fate. Her struggles and sacrifices cannot be in vain!","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/cp4xoPvnGqS55jhWfGW4fJZ3oVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions NADIAZ Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imane’s Promise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644128,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Assïa Khemici","original_name":"Assïa Khemici","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66159743fcadb40164ed5abb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Zouaoui","original_name":"Nadia Zouaoui","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6615969a1c6aa70165f917e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4644129,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rima Kerkebane","original_name":"Rima Kerkebane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66159750fcadb4017ded5cdf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2850434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Salem","original_name":"Sarah Salem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661597339bcd0f017d2c3b57","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970082,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michel Giroux","original_name":"Michel Giroux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661596d60bb0760148302663","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Boualem Ziani","original_name":"Boualem Ziani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661597189408ec017d2d1132","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Zouaoui","original_name":"Nadia Zouaoui","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661596881c6aa7017ef91e57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephanie Hamelin Tomala","original_name":"Stephanie Hamelin Tomala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6615976133a533017d871c53","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4483060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadia Zouaoui","original_name":"Nadia Zouaoui","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661596a8d18b24017c358324","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2393023,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jad Orphée Chami","original_name":"Jad Orphée Chami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661597869408ec017d2d1178","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colette Loumède","original_name":"Colette Loumède","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661596f30bb076016231380d","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32063270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1503,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cp4xoPvnGqS55jhWfGW4fJZ3oVZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
