Rather, such actually and concretely and very tangibly symbolizes the freedom of the democratically organized world in distress. Loznitsa, a tireless worker in archives and historical sites, is a virtuoso of actualization.

A cinematic haiku that could also be a trailer.","popularity":0.0562,"poster_path":"/f4a2njSOOeGmvvKxbSETJwLmEdM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Independence Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"67163480cef14628fef6344c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4a2njSOOeGmvvKxbSETJwLmEdM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Viennale-Trailer 2022: Independence Day by Sergei Loznitsa","key":"uc1T6AOKMi0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-21T10:53:36.000Z","id":"67177f352b9f34249aea0630"}]}}}
