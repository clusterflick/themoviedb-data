In the years following his lung cancer diagnosis in 2010, Franz, during work sessions, recorded hundreds of hours of audio alone and with his wife Elizabeth ranging from finished poems to revisions and fragments, from favorite poems to memos, personal observations to banter.  LAST WORDS is a project that began as an abstract radio play and has evolved into a film that merges poetry and cinema. A film that frames the at times poignant and humorous and at times otherworldly and ecstatic stream of consciousness of Franz & Elizabeth's recordings.  LAST WORDS is a film of deliberate restraint and austerity - a film that drops in and out of consciousness and pays quiet homage to one of the great poets of the late 20th/early 21st century.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slowboat Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Franz Wright: Last Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Wright","original_name":"Franz Wright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6715a4784bf37c883cb6deac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061390,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a4b84bf37c883cb6ded3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061390,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a4ff6dca71e109d4b403","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Wright","original_name":"Franz Wright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a55bbd91c83829d72f95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012328,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Bordin","original_name":"Matt Bordin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a56f4bf37c883cb6df30","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012329,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a57cbd91c83829d72fa9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061427,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philip Koepsell","original_name":"Philip Koepsell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a58fe6edc3bad6101c8e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061390,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a5af4bf37c883cb6df4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William J Oehlkers","original_name":"William J Oehlkers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a5c84bf37c883cb6df58","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012337,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sinead Gallagher","original_name":"Sinead Gallagher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a5dfe6edc3bad6101ca6","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joleen Grussing","original_name":"Joleen Grussing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a6004bf37c883cb6df74","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a60bbd91c83829d72ffd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061427,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philip Koepsell","original_name":"Philip Koepsell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715a6196dca71e109d4b4de","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
