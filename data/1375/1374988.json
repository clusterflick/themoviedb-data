Rape is not considered as a very serious offense, and sometimes rapists are released by the court. Meanwhile, the geneticist Jérôme Lejeune and his association \"Let them live\" triumph in the media. In 1972, minors who had children start a strike in the special school where they lived. Very soon, the MLF supports them. This movie gives the floor to the victims of a society who tries to silence them. These outsiders defend themselves for the first time. A rare document.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80377,"logo_path":"/pPNcRQqJ5JF2iHn6NsDAPEQUoss.png","name":"GREC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Enfants du gouvernement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5014321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Lefevre-Jourde","original_name":"Claude Lefevre-Jourde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6716dc6d6fb09e394c028bfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
