Avoiding the morning traffic jams, our man (Nick Dunbar) finds peace by rowing each day to work in the city. But when a seductive blonde unexpectedly enters the picture, he finds his morning boat ride heading in unexpected directions. Directed by Lala Rolls (Land of My Ancestors), Fish Out of Water was invited to play in the 2005 NZ Film Festival, plus another 10 overseas fests. Victoria Kelly composes the brass and banjo-inflected soundtrack.","popularity":0.7139,"poster_path":"/ynBaIDBqX1lgrKRBcG8DWsUkSe0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deep End
