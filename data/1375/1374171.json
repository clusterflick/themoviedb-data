Growing up in an anti-war family but nevertheless feeling called to join, Julian wrestled with his decision to enlist. JULIAN follows his passage to the Marines, exploring his experiences growing up, his fear of telling his loved ones, and the impact of his decision on his family. Told through the family's vivid home video footage, Julian's own video diaries, and present day interviews with the family, the film is a study of a young man's inner demons and an intimate portrait of family dynamics, grief, and the mysteries locked therein.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Julian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bao Nguyen","original_name":"Bao Nguyen","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/5FfpwFSXOemJiRlgr1oICtNLa6E.jpg","credit_id":"67153f99c6e3040961965d92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bao Nguyen","original_name":"Bao Nguyen","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/5FfpwFSXOemJiRlgr1oICtNLa6E.jpg","credit_id":"67153fa6c6e3040961965d9a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bao Nguyen","original_name":"Bao Nguyen","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/5FfpwFSXOemJiRlgr1oICtNLa6E.jpg","credit_id":"67153facc6e3040961965d9f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bao Nguyen","original_name":"Bao Nguyen","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":"/5FfpwFSXOemJiRlgr1oICtNLa6E.jpg","credit_id":"67153fb2c6e3040961965da2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2049478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
