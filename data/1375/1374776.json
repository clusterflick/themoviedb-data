She was one of the first Israeli transgender activists and also fed stray cats. “Gila Goldstein, Cat Lady” was shot in 1997 during research on the Tel Aviv cat-feeding community. Gila agreed to participate in the film as long as the focus stayed on the cats. But then her friend Ronit Maimon showed up, and the conversation went in a much more colorful direction. The film gives us a glimpse of the Israeli trans community and the lives of these two brave and unique women.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3p6tFLmqbFyXq6Gg2lLUvpXnu5V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gila Goldstein, Cat Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gila Goldstein","original_name":"Gila Goldstein","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"671679ba6dca71e109d4fdf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5013466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronit Mimon","original_name":"Ronit Mimon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"671679cae6edc3bad61065fe","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1115200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yael Bedarshi","original_name":"Yael Bedarshi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67167985bd91c83829d77e25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1115200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yael Bedarshi","original_name":"Yael Bedarshi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6716798d6dca71e109d4fdbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1115200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yael Bedarshi","original_name":"Yael Bedarshi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67167994bd91c83829d77e31","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3p6tFLmqbFyXq6Gg2lLUvpXnu5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
