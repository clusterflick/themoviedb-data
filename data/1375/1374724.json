In this case though, it’s not about killing yourself but killing your father. 40-year-old Sota Kitaura lives at home with his father. During a fight, Sota accidentally kills his father. Not knowing what to do, he calls his younger brother Akira for help and what ensues is perfect chaos with many references to Hitchcock’s funniest film “The Trouble with Harry” (1955). As if a dead father was not enough, Akira ends up also killing Uncle Daisuke.","popularity":0.1982,"poster_path":"/qUSmIucuVy2ZWljLbJzORzOyrEy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2025-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brothers Kitaura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kitaurakyodai","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3709818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaaki Nakano","original_name":"Masaaki Nakano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"673b13262c0b7fd2034ac07c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hirota Otsuka","original_name":"大塚ヒロタ","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/fWxZgSLwAl3JAbLHoTyZDcGTI1m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"673b132c73a45e5184bfa3ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taka Takao","original_name":"Taka Takao","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"673b133bf741eb0428b62813","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2968616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaki Tsujino","original_name":"辻野正樹","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67166887e6edc3bad6105c2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2968616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaki Tsujino","original_name":"辻野正樹","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd1933ee708327c36da6c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2968616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaki Tsujino","original_name":"辻野正樹","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67acd1973ee708327c36da70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rIkEFXMyjaVQEXjKAntlElVKD8M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vr6zGUMxbLBaPRIUYmBta4A44n9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qUSmIucuVy2ZWljLbJzORzOyrEy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Brothers Kitaura I PÖFF28","key":"0GYUx9FZFJw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-21T21:01:00.000Z","id":"672626f96154748a536e4bd3"}]}}}
