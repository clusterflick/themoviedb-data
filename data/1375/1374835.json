All believe they can leave an inspiring testimony for the future and are part of the community of Puerto Resistencia, the symbolic gateway to the marginalized neighborhoods of eastern Cali. Here cultural and social awareness flourishes during Colombia's 2021 national strike. Instead of giving in to hopelessness and driven by their dreams, they raise the Monument to Resistance, a 10-meter building, which becomes a powerful symbol of unity and memory. Through the work of collective creation, it fosters a more inclusive and empathetic environment and shows how art can catalyze change and strengthen community identity.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sueños en concreto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5013657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Wenzel","original_name":"Anton Wenzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67168fbebd91c83829d78a32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viviana Gómez Echeverry","original_name":"Viviana Gómez Echeverry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67168fcacef14628fef65e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34205154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
