Fifteen years later, however, world-stirring events brought a new threat to democracy and a new spirit became evident at the Ministry of War. The ranks of the Regular Army were expanded by an intensive recruiting campaign. As the war-clouds gathered Britain forsook the traditional system of voluntary recruiting and adopted compulsory service, thus ensuring that if the need arose a vast army could rapidly be set on the march. When war did break out, the Army was ready, and it was able to embark for service overseas with efficiency and confidence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":188526,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Paramount News","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1940-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain Shoulder Arms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Vereker","original_name":"John Vereker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67150965d5b7926e94701f7c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Cummins","original_name":"George Cummins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715093ac6e304096196462b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4048814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1940-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
