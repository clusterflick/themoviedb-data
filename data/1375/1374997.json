The film follows the daily activities of an extended family living on a rural farm in Poland. Scenarios openly prompted by the filmmakers are set amongst documentation of the chores of gathering eggs, transporting oil, repairing equipment, butchering rabbits, and tilling the soiling. In the opening scene a man empties his pockets and removes his clothes staring exposed into the camera lens. In such visual intimacy the film follows this central character and his familial acquaintances through the daily rituals of life, industriousness, and preservation in remote Poland.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alexander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anka Sasnal","original_name":"Anka Sasnal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6716e67765418f2b86beb668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilhelm Sasnal","original_name":"Wilhelm Sasnal","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6716e67c10190d24af9ae8a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2789052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
