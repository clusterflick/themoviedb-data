After promising to find Gray's daughter, Silk returns to his boardinghouse, where he finds Alice Sheldon, broke and about to commit suicide. Silk convinces Alice to pose as Zelda Gray and then notifies Lawrence via a note placed in an almond shell that he has found the lost daughter. Lawrence treats Alice so kindly that when Silk demands payment from her on Christmas morning, she refuses. Lawrence, who has overheard the conversation, enters and laughingly reveals that he had known of the frame-up all along. Grateful to Silk for finding him a wife, Lawrence writes the confidence man a large check.","popularity":0.3048,"poster_path":"/tR2M980TnlueLXyENh3EIupCYPa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"What is a shell game?\" In this case Almond shells enter into the plot which is concerned with the schemes of a confident man de luxe.","title":"The Shell Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Good Will and Almond Shells","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Kilgour","original_name":"Joseph Kilgour","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/sBezq0JDRm4n3m5PxW54tDDEN2y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"'Silk' Wilkins","credit_id":"6716b7468f06df13e2276b04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kolker","original_name":"Henry Kolker","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/mZ5QUU0Sm8h5x4YdSO6ekiRGswU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lawrence Gray","credit_id":"6716b7515ac96b88a035ea63","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2392830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmy Wehlen","original_name":"Emmy Wehlen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/marHjvHkpR0wXRP1ThxzVP084Zo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zlice Sheldon","credit_id":"6716b75f4cfa2002eb28a048","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1370580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricca Allen","original_name":"Ricca Allen","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/zKVAS0G1ARYHUT6P3oVIBTmWp6W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Landlady","credit_id":"6716b7735ac96b88a035ea73","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald MacBride","original_name":"Donald MacBride","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/AkOwJ81bJkoorsGZMjhMpQZbCrO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vocal Teacher","credit_id":"6716b7abf1687f22e3238494","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3908931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Cogan","original_name":"Fanny Cogan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Wentworth","credit_id":"6716b76acaed9efefdfced5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3293078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Jeffrey","original_name":"Hugh Jeffrey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Headwaiter","credit_id":"6716b7844a9fc06d2575270e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1852030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Thornton","original_name":"Richard Thornton","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Hotel Manager","credit_id":"6716b798caed9efefdfced8b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3137625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Heritage","original_name":"Clarence Heritage","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Maestro","credit_id":"6716b7a1f1687f22e3238490","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George D.
