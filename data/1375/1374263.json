Both fell sick in 1975, the onset of incurable depression for one and a bloody civil war ushering in deep divisions for the other. In this sequel to LEBANON: BITS AND PIECES (1994), Nakkas ponders the plight of the country she clearly loves while honoring the mother dear to her.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8au94aZn6aMFA1AFQMQpLsV5pxo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caravan Films","origin_country":""},{"id":124125,"logo_path":"/oUEfgXsAJqnbddGgX8OSTjUzGIO.png","name":"Djinn House Productions","origin_country":"LB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother, Lebanon & Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1443811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Nakkas","original_name":"Olga Nakkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jTNE8WAZVL2hpmj0m7GvrGHCQr3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"671568c56dca71e109d49cd2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5011831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Nakkas","original_name":"Mimi Nakkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"671568cf6dca71e109d49ce2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeina Dirani","original_name":"Zeina Dirani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67178ae150a6eb0bfbc28335","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elham Halou","original_name":"Elham Halou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67178af550a6eb0bfbc2834f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nagy Ghandour","original_name":"Nagy Ghandour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67178b5c88be821f649a8524","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1443811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Nakkas","original_name":"Olga Nakkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jTNE8WAZVL2hpmj0m7GvrGHCQr3.jpg","credit_id":"671565636dca71e109d49c0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1443811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Nakkas","original_name":"Olga Nakkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jTNE8WAZVL2hpmj0m7GvrGHCQr3.jpg","credit_id":"6715657c6dca71e109d49c1c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1443811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Nakkas","original_name":"Olga Nakkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jTNE8WAZVL2hpmj0m7GvrGHCQr3.jpg","credit_id":"671787f75e9d6f5d0d48f3be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015190,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hratch A.
