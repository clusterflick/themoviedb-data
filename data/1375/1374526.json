Some saw it as a sign that somebody in America cared about them. To Colonel Gail “Hal” Halvorsen, who became known worldwide as the Candy Bomber, the Berlin Airlift was healing balm on the wounds of war. He and his fellow American pilots dropped more than two million tons of supplies and 23 tons of candy to German citizens and children during the Berlin Airlift. KUED presents the inspiring story of the Utah pilot whose simple gesture of goodwill won the hearts of a former enemy and made him a hero to people around the world.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/rZKEPedtMmAcmLbMws3ZeBztHvm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":242419,"logo_path":null,"name":"KUED","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Candy Bomber","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5012727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Randle","original_name":"Rick Randle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6715e2dee6edc3bad6102f8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Halvorsen","original_name":"Gail Halvorsen","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/3YBXmdbi6TvZU2IY579qAC0yNc7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6715e2ec9943637ce5829a8d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3312117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Verdoia","original_name":"Ken Verdoia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4rtkuidyDvNpBkVojVSOtwoPAXL.jpg","credit_id":"6715e32ce6edc3bad6102fab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3312117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Verdoia","original_name":"Ken Verdoia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4rtkuidyDvNpBkVojVSOtwoPAXL.jpg","credit_id":"6715e3349943637ce5829aa4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Searle","original_name":"Elizabeth Searle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6715e3594bf37c883cb6f150","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rZKEPedtMmAcmLbMws3ZeBztHvm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
