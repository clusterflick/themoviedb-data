It takes into account around thirty shots, in the most lively way possible, in the form of dialogues between two actors; a bit like a dialogue in front of an editing table. In the picture, we can only see this shot, but slowed down, stopped, traveled in all directions, with no other special effects than these changes in speed. These voices of today's actors, which the viewer recognizes - Fanny Ardant, Michel Piccoli, Ariane Ascaride, Jean-Pierre Darroussin - are a link between the cinema of the past and the cinema of today.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le cinéma, une histoire de plans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Bergala","original_name":"Alain Bergala","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/AfyT9AtqBmRGLMDPKwD9OiFqIWF.jpg","credit_id":"6716de301e22d3fb6bbd39d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
