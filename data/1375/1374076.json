Such a destiny, so often portrayed in the arts, could not but be embodied at the Opera. In 1693, Marc-Antoine Charpentier premiered his only “tragédie lyrique”, based on a libretto by Thomas Corneille, at the Académie royale de Musique – forerunner of the Paris Opera – in the presence of Louis XIV. Three centuries after its creation, this baroque score of great orchestral wealth returns for the first time to the stage of the Paris Opera, under the baton of William Christie. Renowned for his exceptionally articulate interpretations, director David McVicar transposes the action to the Second World War, thus reinforcing the heroine’s tragic character.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/eYKQeXoqz3wpO5UkRfg2DuhEWvu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":187,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera National de Paris","title":"Médée","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2157586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea Desandre","original_name":"Lea Desandre","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/clx6mN9SwSINodSJGwv313fbPKx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Medee","credit_id":"6715082099f22f326aad8355","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Roset","original_name":"Julie Roset","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Amour","credit_id":"6715083299f22f326aad8366","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle de Negri","original_name":"Emmanuelle de Negri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nerine","credit_id":"671508510cb6252f9908c427","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1691831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinoud van Mechelen","original_name":"Reinoud van Mechelen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nSnauQGsIghu5mP4anBBNPVM9e8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jason","credit_id":"671508680cb6252f9908c451","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3617437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisandro Abadie","original_name":"Lisandro Abadie","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Arcas","credit_id":"67150901c6e3040961964601","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Naouri","original_name":"Laurent Naouri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/o2sx13HsVagwyF5fpkOYmrNBnDu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Creon","credit_id":"6715091f99f22f326aad8495","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Bintner","original_name":"Gordon Bintner","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Oronte","credit_id":"67150938650248b9db627d61","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3337949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Vieira Leite","original_name":"Ana Vieira Leite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Créuse","credit_id":"6715096d99f22f326aad84d9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elodie Fonnard","original_name":"Elodie Fonnard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Cleone","credit_id":"671509802bbba65f7b1149da","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Christie","original_name":"William Christie","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"671509a399f22f326aad850c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362307,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc-Antoine Charpentier","original_name":"Marc-Antoine Charpentier","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/A1gPMsSOMjj4VMMFB7sJP34aRji.jpg","credit_id":"671509cd2bbba65f7b114a17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David McVicar","original_name":"David McVicar","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/9vjLk3oylt2gN3OjqlzNKXwCxdt.jpg","credit_id":"671509e02bbba65f7b114a24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":795,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eYKQeXoqz3wpO5UkRfg2DuhEWvu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
