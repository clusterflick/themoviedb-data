Kaufman and Edna Ferber collaborated on this 1927 hit comedy about an eminent and slightly eccentric theatrical clan. A Barrymore-like brood, the Cavendishes are as flamboyant offstage as they are on. Their real-life family drama occurs in a Manhattan apartment when the grand matriarch, Fanny Cavendish, learns that her daughter and granddaughter may both be giving up the stage for marriage. Theatre legends Rosemary Harris, Eva LeGallienne, Sam Levene and Ellis Rabb have great fun portraying characters they know all too well from their years on stage.","popularity":0.534,"poster_path":"/mVZDoJ6tWdl3WQXekjbQ30CLODr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadway Theatre Archive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Family","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1765880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Barton","original_name":"Donald Barton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gilbert Marshall","credit_id":"58b3293592514177d100a652","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Harris","original_name":"Rosemary Harris","popularity":0.7748,"profile_path":"/3Mu02enwaF8dFuT195f7esILXns.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julie Cavendish","credit_id":"55f0a88fc3a3685d92000020","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Le Gallienne","original_name":"Eva Le Gallienne","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":"/OJxG67Q37MQGvKeRdrLwRtUCgn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fanny Cavendish","credit_id":"55f0a89ac3a3685d92000023","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellis Rabb","original_name":"Ellis Rabb","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tony Cavendish","credit_id":"55f0a8a3c3a3685d92000027","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1273436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Layne","original_name":"Mary Layne","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gwen Cavendish","credit_id":"55f0a8aec3a3685d8d00001d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Buckman","original_name":"Forrest Buckman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Perry Stewart","credit_id":"55f0a8bec3a3685d9a00002a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Levene","original_name":"Sam Levene","popularity":0.2148,"profile_path":"/kATWTkWQdPXS0Ry3OfiYrFHEg0L.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Oscar Wolfe","credit_id":"55f0a8cb9251412c3f000027","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosetta LeNoire","original_name":"Rosetta LeNoire","popularity":0.31,"profile_path":"/bI7IRVBXANRTIj65dagqEhoWXCG.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Della","credit_id":"55f0a8d2c3a3685d8d000022","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Louise Wilson","original_name":"Mary Louise Wilson","popularity":0.2597,"profile_path":"/sCWT5ygDqoegJzcZTwt063Dyrsk.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Kitty Dean","credit_id":"55f0a8ddc3a3685d9f000027","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18739,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edna Ferber","original_name":"Edna Ferber","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/xN0OWVJXYWzM1sZAEePnyxAzr3T.jpg","credit_id":"55f0a8779251412c4b000027","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellis Rabb","original_name":"Ellis Rabb","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f0a8669251412c3c000020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Browning","original_name":"Kirk Browning","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/sqqMIpAeowuV9dFVYHmgeocOGMr.jpg","credit_id":"55f0a8709251412c4b000024","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144060,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George S.
