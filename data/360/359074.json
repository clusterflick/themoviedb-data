One of the cowboys rescues a girl on a stagecoach and her grateful father agrees to finance them.  Along the way, she pretends to fall in love with one of the cowboys.  Thinking he is about to be very rich, he sets out, but upon arrival, he finds that a bad man has stolen the claim and started a town.  There, everyone turns on him, including the girl, but luckily, another pretty girl,  a barmaid (who is secretly in love with him), sticks by him, and he ends up in a climactic shootout on the mountain where the gold is stashed.","popularity":0.6616,"poster_path":"/9iABwzGmeZZ0ZjG1XurbDHKz6qK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sol Lesser
