As they join forces with the likes of a pregnant woman, a moronic arms dealer, and a mentally challenged man, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombie mayhem. While this uprising of zombies has overwhelmed the city, Mr. Roberts, the CEO of R2 Pharmaceuticals, has sent in a team of mercenaries known as the S.I.E.G.E into Cyrene City to recover the only known antidote for his own financial gain. Not Another Zombie Movie... About the Living Dead is a hilarious twisted tale about survival versus morality during a zombie apocalypse. Watch as these survivors discover there is no such thing as a hero when zombies are trying to eat your face off.","popularity":0.1544,"poster_path":"/onpSYutLPlGiUzJaC96AgbwVMET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diesel World Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":105044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jay Davis Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-31","revenue":15000,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Another Zombie Movie....About the Living Dead","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Not Another Zombie Movie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Davis","original_name":"Jay Davis","popularity":0.1567,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"55f729a89251416d96003663","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Dennis","original_name":"Harold Dennis","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/t4n6qdrCrWegvfOPKLBPvsQXrTq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Colonel Parker","credit_id":"55f729c0c3a3684fae003ec8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Cummings III","original_name":"Will Cummings III","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cooper","credit_id":"55f729cd9251414f6d005a5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Evans","original_name":"Calvin Evans","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":"/ujaplmGZLcO2RtjrgPxncsczKhQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Peanut","credit_id":"55f729d5c3a3686d0700b6cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1510263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Dallas","original_name":"Jackie Dallas","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/qgi2NIFFeDyRgSodxn8UZFpzugx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Maggie","credit_id":"55f729ddc3a3686d0b00b9f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven James Price","original_name":"Steven James Price","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Mr. Roberts","credit_id":"5f90fe8b278d8a003737966c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lamar Barnes","original_name":"Lamar Barnes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Dr. Chambers","credit_id":"5f90ff28c8f858003a6a6d35","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Barbee","original_name":"James Barbee","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Captain Williams","credit_id":"5f90fefec8f85800396b4349","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesnaira Baez","original_name":"Jesnaira Baez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Laboratory Assistant","credit_id":"5f90fee4d9f4a60039d6d5cc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deena Barnes","original_name":"Deena Barnes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Franklin's Wife","credit_id":"5f90ff1455c1f40038226629","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffery Baylock","original_name":"Jeffery Baylock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Laboratory Aassistant","credit_id":"5f90ff4124b3330034ef7ab5","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlon J.
