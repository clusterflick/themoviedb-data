In the university, several interests groups or clubs are commonplace. Against the Heavy Weights Club, another club Silver Lines Movement is born.  SLM vows to oppose all antisocial, antidemocratic tendencies including economic exploitation on campus. The ensuing battle between the two clubs reveals the frenzied struggles for supremacy in all aspects of campus life.  It also exposes the special interests of godfathers from inside and outside campus.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"2004-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Campus Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Segun Adefila","original_name":"Segun Adefila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3d695c3a3680a0d00276b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lanre Fasasi","original_name":"Lanre Fasasi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3d69ec3a3686cfd002446","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tope Idowu","original_name":"Tope Idowu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3d6a69251414a56002318","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khabirat Kafidipe","original_name":"Khabirat Kafidipe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3d6b09251414a67002216","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serah Mbaka","original_name":"Serah Mbaka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55f3d6bcc3a36871ec00249b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tunde Kelani","original_name":"Tunde Kelani","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/ySDmbM5bzU4fG4UOBiIwdNsvkL8.jpg","credit_id":"55f3d67a9251417cfc001a72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tunde Kelani","original_name":"Tunde Kelani","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/ySDmbM5bzU4fG4UOBiIwdNsvkL8.jpg","credit_id":"55f3d6859251413a960017e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508732,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frank Anore","original_name":"Frank Anore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f3d6cf9251417473000bcc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0489455","wikidata_id":"Q20978147","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
