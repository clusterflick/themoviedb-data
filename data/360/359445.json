Armed with a keen sense of smell and backed up by 1,700 pounds, fur and fangs, the polar bear stands alone at the top of the food chain. Yet many other hunters manage to survive in and around harsh arctic waters from the savvy arctic fox to the massive, whiskered walrus. The Arctic ice is revealed as a place of danger and drama as animals are stranded on frozen waters, trapped between moving sheets of ice, and caught in the struggle to survive. Brave the worst that nature has to offer.","popularity":0.5425,"poster_path":"/2F2UbctjCLhOJVkub1XFds5qvvv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic - Arctic Kingdom: Life at the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Coburn","original_name":"James Coburn","popularity":3.7657,"profile_path":"/9GApjInyrVvjnTAr652C1aViPqZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"628c68966c849271887ad9f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692609,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Jameson-Henry","original_name":"Christine Jameson-Henry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628c6c140b7316006613dddd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564017,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The Insects","original_name":"The Insects","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628c6c552495ab74d97d5553","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89653,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Truitt","original_name":"Lisa Truitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628c6bae12425c0052733ac9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137880,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicolas Noxon","original_name":"Nicolas Noxon","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637cdd6007faa20098caf440","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":139345,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janet Hess","original_name":"Janet Hess","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dac7577394104c1f22bfe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0864952","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2F2UbctjCLhOJVkub1XFds5qvvv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
