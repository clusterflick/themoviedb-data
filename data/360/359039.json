But few know the depths of both faiths as well as Bill McCartney, the former head football coach of the University of Colorado and the founder of Promise Keepers, a Christian men’s ministry.  “The Gospel According to Mac” tells the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story of Coach Mac’s controversial national championship run – two seasons that followed multiple arrests and strife between his mostly African-American players and the Boulder police, continued with McCartney’s own daughter becoming pregnant by the team’s quarterback before seeing that same quarterback struck by cancer, and culminated in consecutive Orange Bowl match-ups against Notre Dame.  Bill McCartney’s passionate and often polarizing beliefs have made him many enemies and many admirers, but it’s difficult to deny that he embodies the essential issues facing football in America to this day.","popularity":0.7444,"poster_path":"/6EpppBVqYSDwv9vDmzFOjU7oPj5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not everyone believes a believer","title":"The Gospel According to Mac","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Wright","original_name":"Jeffrey Wright","popularity":1.6811,"profile_path":"/yGcuHGW4glqRpOPxgiCvjcren7F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"61c5dbd9e72fe8001c09aead","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Podhoretz","original_name":"Jim Podhoretz","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f07b37c3a3684c8d000848","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip Aromando","original_name":"Philip Aromando","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5dbe519ab5900969b64c9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302160,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Evans","original_name":"Alex Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5dbf08813e4001cd969d5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302160,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Evans","original_name":"Alex Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5dbfb19ab590019f10522","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hock","original_name":"Jonathan Hock","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/1qzxg46cetSmRGqL6unAt9f20Ia.jpg","credit_id":"61c5dc052ac4990060531d6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Hock","original_name":"Jonathan Hock","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/1qzxg46cetSmRGqL6unAt9f20Ia.jpg","credit_id":"61c5dc0c2ac499004198d05b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5059498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":1283,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9A1rQznrd44KsULa7Jav3jS17Jq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2286},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ZZ000Vvzyrge5j0f9hknUHJD6J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sSn0g0H43iqpKRhAODrO6HL6u2R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/htJvgfDeHKzJQcfDKvywNQ6RL3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":935,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xYnA9FSReZeY0TJvhHt4NIoNI40.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1662}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.523,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iFDuwfVCrc8EhwKZGpl8vOTHfDG.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1980}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6EpppBVqYSDwv9vDmzFOjU7oPj5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":579,"name":"american football"},{"id":5621,"name":"american football coach"},{"id":1981,"name":"colorado"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":231401,"name":"college american football"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Disney+","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
