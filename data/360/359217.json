One morning, the city's French jeweler Michel Dumartin receives a visit from a client named José Llanos, one of the regime's fiercest opponents. Llanos is soon denounced and shot dead by Salvador's men. At the same time, Dumartin was accused of complicity with the rebels. Arrested and imprisoned in the fortress, he is ripe for the death penalty.","popularity":0.4348,"poster_path":"/a0C7C7dok7I6ayJ9geN5ujA09gf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Italia Produzione Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Sigma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Will it Strike Noon","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dany Robin","original_name":"Dany Robin","popularity":0.3112,"profile_path":"/eM6c1euYBxPLOHWbUqn3dzSQqtS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christine Dumartin","credit_id":"55f1e11b92514167010026d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Marchal","original_name":"Georges Marchal","popularity":0.2923,"profile_path":"/n9Ct7fmIFAHRtXaRlrMaECMDF2k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Michel Dumartin","credit_id":"55f1e123c3a3683bec0028aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Roger Caussimon","original_name":"Jean-Roger Caussimon","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":"/wZOk9cWlCfkYBZeQk9i36U840XW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Don Gaspar","credit_id":"55f1e12ec3a368230a002a1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Dudan","original_name":"Pierre Dudan","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/4kKmAB3d49ZoI1uvYoy9W35Q52V.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Luisito","credit_id":"55f1e136c3a36822f5002a03","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascale Roberts","original_name":"Pascale Roberts","popularity":0.2621,"profile_path":"/abS16nVsjCSofwl3O98uASA3cnU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"La Morenita","credit_id":"62060f6f559d22009ad634ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Lupovici","original_name":"Marcel Lupovici","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/98Prfi5yK5aGgsL67zjJXhxLXpw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Don Ramon","credit_id":"62060f8393388b00b7b36f36","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Bailly","original_name":"Roland Bailly","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yAMc3NCXEF3Ope6WPEMkBnUKKZ7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"El Zubon","credit_id":"62060f9401432500b6c3312d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Lewgoy","original_name":"José Lewgoy","popularity":0.2386,"profile_path":"/tkP1ujMMrrVzCWsSNGdVj7KjapF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Salvador","credit_id":"62060fa355937b0042d7f78a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Benard","original_name":"Maurice Benard","popularity":0.5481,"profile_path":"/soTGLUO1QjA0zon1MovyCHjCeWs.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62060fb129733800677490be","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":37796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Carrer","original_name":"Emilio Carrer","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62060fc19408ec00cc6a5854","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2254264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Combal","original_name":"Jean Combal","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/xwFAPZN7W8Tbnl7y08DuyNwDuzd.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62060fc89408ec00421f6172","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edmond T.
