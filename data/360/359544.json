Despite living in the middle of the digital age, this heretical director hailing from the snowy plains of Canada has spent 25 years transposing the uncommon and the uncanny onto screens over-saturated with naturalistic imagery. A lover of primitive cinema, he has cunningly summoned the light-and-shadow techniques and experimentations of the Golden Age of film to resuscitate a unique cinematographic language which plays with the spectator’s unconscious by means of visual trickery as disturbing as it is absurd. In an attitude as playful at that Maddin’s films this documentary follows the mediumistic experiments of this master of illusion, filmed during the ‘’spirit’’ shootings he presented in Europe.","popularity":0.4729,"poster_path":"/d4rW1uuogvBq54ZK8yHKCQ86IKV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63251,"logo_path":"/ljeZdkJP2W5ag4PEo3Om5XAwGTF.png","name":"Brainworks","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 1000 Eyes of Dr Maddin","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Maddin","original_name":"Guy Maddin","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/hF15rfnugsLQJfa6R1AvVAX7bEu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55f4b3389251414a56003d3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55f5d3da9251414f6d001a50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55f5d3ebc3a3686d03006ef6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Waters","original_name":"John Waters","popularity":1.5612,"profile_path":"/4foU1kJ24CJwz2RVZgyc7oxMs4i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55f5d5cd92514175f8000edc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Anger","original_name":"Kenneth Anger","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/gspoSoEjQSpBKBQx3g9frjFOM7f.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55f5d5dac3a36871ec006b02","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"564da6ba925141594d004bd6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Rossellini","original_name":"Isabella Rossellini","popularity":2.4103,"profile_path":"/z0zojT6nwDxi35HMcXlVpBfuBAU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"564da6c292514158f6005405","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Montmayeur","original_name":"Yves Montmayeur","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f4b325c3a3680a0d0043db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Montmayeur","original_name":"Yves Montmayeur","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f5d3cec3a3686d0b007225","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486271,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.G.
