The moon raises over mountaintops, melts with the woods. A path dissolves with the view. Colors rendered liquid. Data holes vanish in the distance. Memory, processing, nothing lasts forever. A hike through a natural reservoir; recorded, saved, consolidated. A landscape interpretation by means of MPEG algorithms. In #47, alternating fixed camera shots and pans display a landscape from the hiker’s point of view. Where the path leads to, remains unclear. #47 belongs to a video-work series, researching the relationship between landscape- representation, perception and the unconscious. The technics applied to the footage are a mix between some hacking of the MPEG-information and faulty encoding settings. During this process, crucial data is removed from the MPEG-stream and fed back to the computer to make it ‘work’, forcing software to re-interpret the visual information.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"#47","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508247,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Miguel Biscaya","original_name":"José Miguel Biscaya","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f298b8c3a36822ef003f75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508247,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Miguel Biscaya","original_name":"José Miguel Biscaya","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f298cc92514167050041c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508247,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Miguel Biscaya","original_name":"José Miguel Biscaya","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f29a4ec3a36823030041ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4155792","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IFFR presents: #47 by José Miguel Biscaya","key":"ilPUMBcGDAw","published_at":"2015-07-23T09:44:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"55f2995c92514167050041d4"}]}}}
