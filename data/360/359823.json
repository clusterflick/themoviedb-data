We see a single, uninterrupted shot but this time it's of a young woman laying on the asphalt after being hit by a drunk driver. As the camera pans slowly away from her eyes (one of which is dilated, an indicator of severe brain trauma) we see paramedics trying to resuscitate her as she lays lifeless in a pool of her own blood. Played over the footage is the audio of the drunk driver who caused the accident being quizzed by a police officer, desperately pleading for her to \"be alright\" â€“ though it appears that the paramedics' attempts to resuscitate her continue to be futile.","popularity":0.2389,"poster_path":"/ayx4HpOi2BjNGiSKfO2ZZ6kvTNX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":216277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Van Outen","original_name":"Denise Van Outen","popularity":0.1951,"profile_path":"/mW58OolSCjFqhTBhuimca4NIKio.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"648397b5e375c000acc4cd50","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayx4HpOi2BjNGiSKfO2ZZ6kvTNX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
