A woman is compared to a cat, and then we see a little girl on a playground, kissing, hugging and swatting a little boy companion as if he were a doll-plaything. A supermarket is compared to a flea market; an upscale equestrian event is compared to a soccer match, a comic bullfight and other attractions. Marker edited and Lhomme was the cameraman.","popularity":0.2581,"poster_path":"/9mDCrlPkfSlBlA3QwVTOSjT1uXn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofracima","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playtime in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Winter","original_name":"Catherine Winter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66219885bb1057014dd232c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17556,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Lhomme","original_name":"Pierre Lhomme","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/5ucStq5YyMjSkbpChO200WOm6Oi.jpg","credit_id":"5b07df5c9251417214004755","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Marker","original_name":"Chris Marker","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/4hcLsvsYKcjx5oJJ0IshXK9L1l9.jpg","credit_id":"5b07df66c3a3683da300648b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel Legrand","original_name":"Michel Legrand","popularity":0.3026,"profile_path":"/nkhKfgrBjWZ7BVuI8dZztkX7bcV.jpg","credit_id":"5b07df769251417270004c8e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7570860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9mDCrlPkfSlBlA3QwVTOSjT1uXn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
