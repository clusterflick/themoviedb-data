Jed believes his brother, Ralph, is behind the many hold-ups of his stagecoaches but has no proof. Ralph, in turn, blames Jed for the attacks on the linemen of his pioneer telegraph company. Big Bart, a ruthless gunman and outlaw-gang leader working for crooked banker Jordan Weatherbee, is actually behind the troubles of both companies. Bart plans to frame Jed for a double-murder and then kill him. Monte saves his life and, together, they devise a plan of their own to bring an end to the reign of lawlessness along the timber trail.","popularity":1.3544,"poster_path":"/yVftQHzC63CZid13gxrjm5Qg3LB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SIX-GUN Law and Order","title":"The Timber Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Hale","original_name":"Monte Hale","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/lnWpg7Ds1WsHhzt7QLpvBJXaUo4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monte Hale","credit_id":"55f1a66d9251416707001fe5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Roberts","original_name":"Lynne Roberts","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/ql5Lr9mbifrjAVUvhvLBqw7aTuz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alice Baker","credit_id":"55f1a6789251416714001f32","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Burke","original_name":"James Burke","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/6xXAL2XkRoowVkxtreZjFs5tjLY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jed Baker","credit_id":"55f1a684c3a3682307002125","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Barcroft","original_name":"Roy Barcroft","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/57EKCVAOfcNKNNcHBtkmp0cU9od.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Big Bart","credit_id":"55f1a68d92514145300009f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ford","original_name":"Francis Ford","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/v5MKJZbr5kwP7KbLjNgw7Bqwsto.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ralph Baker","credit_id":"5907e8fe9251416492004d00","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Emmett Keane","original_name":"Robert Emmett Keane","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/5K1yKBJIwJAYge9nwK2AhfsnoKI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jordon Weatherbee, Banker","credit_id":"5907e90bc3a3685873004a2f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Darrell","original_name":"Steve Darrell","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/mPADuDDsXkXBaxl51CAKQCVpH0r.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"5907e918925141646c004b52","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Graham","original_name":"Fred Graham","popularity":0.1705,"profile_path":"/ytQfyLKEMl78N5q2wDNiNjnE4bY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henchman Frank","credit_id":"5907e925925141644a004d95","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wade Crosby","original_name":"Wade Crosby","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":"/tBnEQkUIzmQhLKkdnsgVDpqwHTu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Henchman Walt","credit_id":"5907e9309251416492004d1f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Acuff","original_name":"Eddie Acuff","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/x1Y1UKWO4H2wsm1MkAOXjyDosXf.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Telegraph Operator","credit_id":"5907e93dc3a3685859004baf","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Foy Willing","original_name":"Foy Willing","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Guitar Player Foy -
