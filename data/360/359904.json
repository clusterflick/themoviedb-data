In a series of mischievous adventures, Pinocchio thinks he can get by on a variety of clever lies and tricks. There is one problem: his nose grows every time he tells a lie. One way or another, the truth always comes out; and Pinocchio finds out that lying doesn't pay. This buoyant adaptation comes alive with the spirited music of the Mediterranean.","popularity":0.0944,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabbit Ears Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabbit Ears -  Pinocchio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Aiello","original_name":"Danny Aiello","popularity":0.878,"profile_path":"/2WiZ8SkiFU355GUT2QuSPlenrfM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67006764f878adfed0854080","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
