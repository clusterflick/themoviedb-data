This also extends to the protagonist of the film, a head on a foot without a body or arms who pads wearily through the depressing surroundings. Upon seeing various figures in the sky, he begins to copy their movements. To his surprise, he himself manages to grow wings and takes to the skies. But his attempt at flight ends in a sobering manner however, as it is revealed that flying creatures are just restricted in their range.","popularity":0.2916,"poster_path":"/pxgnSsVe5wy41wwcGQcPqTY9Q2C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55763,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEFA-Studio für Trickfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einmart","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"613bdcf407faa2002a5ff743","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marion Rasche","original_name":"Marion Rasche","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bdcd6e27260002a963632","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164103,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heinz Kaiser","original_name":"Heinz Kaiser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bdd7fc68b690044a9423f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229937,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Erika Wahl","original_name":"Erika Wahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bdd2108cf8700620a24ef","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helga Kurth","original_name":"Helga Kurth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bdd46a6ddcb0061beced3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229936,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Monika Siegel","original_name":"Monika Siegel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bdd1108cf87002a8dc026","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229935,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ingrid Gubisch","original_name":"Ingrid Gubisch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bdce9e272600063482ed0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"55f1a7ba9251416714001f59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5b4f473dc3a368304d012e60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1784925,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eva d'Bomba","original_name":"Eva d'Bomba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4f477dc3a36830550113ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Hertel","original_name":"Thomas Hertel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4f479ec3a3683055011443","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086862,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Schöne","original_name":"Hans Schöne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4f474a92514138d100eace","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3083844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pxgnSsVe5wy41wwcGQcPqTY9Q2C.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1566,"name":"dreams"},{"id":334,"name":"flying"},{"id":6089,"name":"freedom"},{"id":1523,"name":"obsession"},{"id":18420,"name":"surveillance"},{"id":34152,"name":"evolution"},{"id":189092,"name":"journey"},{"id":202648,"name":"fragmented"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":293089,"name":"grow wings"},{"id":293090,"name":"flying creature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
