For just a moment, generally counted in minutes, the world is a frozen arrow pointing at the thought of something important, so important that it should never be forgotten. As a meditative memento on the importance of a collective memory, we have compiled a series of these moments into a film. Together these sampled minutes of silence reflect one of few activities that bring people together regardless of religion, race or cultural background.  The archival material outlines a mute history of tragedy and grief, often staged against a backdrop of natural disasters and violent conflict. But the footage is also a reminder of the stoic nature of humans, never accepting the horrors of terror attacks, war or rogue killers.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moments of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mats Bigert","original_name":"Mats Bigert","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kP48675OVf3B3zgnODxBCe5CR0p.jpg","credit_id":"55f7269cc3a3686cfd00afff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Bergström","original_name":"Lars Bergström","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f726a992514175f8004d2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4159812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
