The villain of the piece intends to bankrupt all the local ranchers and grab up the surrounding property for himself. But with Curley involved, the bad guy and his minions don't have a chance. The screenplay, by D. W. Griffith alumnus Elmer Clifton, is a medley of western cliches, pausing every so often for a first-rate action sequence. Perennial sagebrush sidekick Sid Saylor provides negligible comedy relief.","popularity":0.7182,"poster_path":"/7mpWQbvybZplHUEJVQcwnacap3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WAYLAID...BY HIGH ADVENTURE ON THE RANGE!","title":"Ambush Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Steele","original_name":"Bob Steele","popularity":0.3453,"profile_path":"/jOaQFxwyNWRNEEdRoiiRaOVrOpK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Curley Thompson","credit_id":"55f0541e92514140b00001da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syd Saylor","original_name":"Syd Saylor","popularity":0.1896,"profile_path":"/2PS6KPHdoM8wF8gDFMYtb02iq4T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sam Hawkins","credit_id":"55f0543692514140b00001df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"I.
