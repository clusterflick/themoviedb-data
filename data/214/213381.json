Almost two million fish at least once a year. Fishing might be the most remarkable sport in the world. The documentary V.I.S.S.E.N (FISHING) dives into the world of Dutch fish and fishermen. Above and under water, on the IJ, at the coast, on the North Sea, in the cities, in the polder and on and by lakes and rivers. The film is a personal, filmic search for the “primordial fisher” in mankind and a portrait of the Netherlands by and on the water. V.I.S.S.E.N is also about what moves the fishermen. Who are the people that fish? Is fishing a hobby, a sport, an escape or a primordial instinct one cannot repress? What goes through your mind when you fish, when you catch something, or when you do not catch anything. And: what's it like for the fish, getting hooked?","popularity":0.2208,"poster_path":"/5mC470ZewEOCLCnHMmtjkdWhEwl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.” — Henry David Thoreau","title":"F.I.S.H.I.N.G","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter-Rim de Kroon","original_name":"Pieter-Rim de Kroon","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dc4c3a368484e1fc58f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maarten de Kroon","original_name":"Maarten de Kroon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b420d719aeb04a1ebb2dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368693,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeroen Nadorp","original_name":"Jeroen Nadorp","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b4234719aeb0477ebb392","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828719,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erik Disselhoff","original_name":"Erik Disselhoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b421a8ec4ab02ebae8ece","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934414,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul van den Bos","original_name":"Paul van den Bos","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b42158ec4ab0446ae8e3d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200724,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stef Tijdink","original_name":"Stef Tijdink","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b42248ec4ab049aae8e45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105969,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Victor Dekker","original_name":"Victor Dekker","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643b422b37806204bc159d45","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1506655,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annemiek van der Hell","original_name":"Annemiek van der Hell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wtr4JXP8WBAJE2FALrwRMaqjVCV.jpg","credit_id":"643b42063780620492159e56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2236902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5mC470ZewEOCLCnHMmtjkdWhEwl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"},{"id":181324,"name":"existentialism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
