Parents, with the help of the non-profit group Parent Revolution, gather signatures from over 51% of the families at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA. When their petitions are turned in to the district, demanding that a charter school take over McKinley, the controversy begins. Everyday people, who simply want a better life for their children, suddenly find themselves doing extraordinary things: appearing on television, speaking at press conferences, lobbying in the state capital, and becoming community leaders. On their journey they inspire a national movement and discover that education is a political beast.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/knl0Eix6H34mCmwJp3H8sGT0Bvi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We the Parents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Villaraigosa","original_name":"Antonio Villaraigosa","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4dcdc3a368484e1feae1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Martinez","original_name":"Cynthia Martinez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4dcdc3a368484e1feae5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198497,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Takata","original_name":"James Takata","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dcdc3a368484e1fead1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198499,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Welsh Takata","original_name":"Jennifer Welsh Takata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dcdc3a368484e1feadd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198497,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Takata","original_name":"James Takata","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aad19b9c3a36846ba011989","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2115439","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/knl0Eix6H34mCmwJp3H8sGT0Bvi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
