Bored, and looking for a new playground, they enter an imposing, decaying building that has been abandoned for years. Abandoned and distressed, the building stands alone in its surroundings. No other buildings dare approach. A warning to visitors the children should have noticed. Using classic horror motifs and contemporary characters, CLICK discovers why we are afraid of the dark. A discovery that the children make in possibly the last building they will ever enter.","popularity":0.2715,"poster_path":"/pBM6KBvEbpl5N68XDlCbdW6xHqA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Falconer Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Click","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Parker","original_name":"Francesca Parker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"5db9f6fe0f2fbd00177728a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Hird","original_name":"Lucy Hird","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"5db9f707dbf1440016503d6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Leach","original_name":"Daniel Leach","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"5db9f70e0f2fbd00147612a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Holland","original_name":"Samuel Holland","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Freddie","credit_id":"5db9f7172d37210013ec4746","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Spencer","original_name":"Jamie Spencer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"5db9f722dbf14400135034b3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Prince","original_name":"William Prince","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dbec3a368484e1fad13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Prince","original_name":"William Prince","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db9f6bc0f2fbd0017772845","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1692297","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6wxxxHmlRutlJawem2nkWgYrjkO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pBM6KBvEbpl5N68XDlCbdW6xHqA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
