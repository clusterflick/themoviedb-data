The film never lets you forget that what you’re seeing is simply paint being rearranged into recognizable shapes, yet the pumping musical score and expressiveness of its titular character provide a simultaneous emotional experience. The abstract backgrounds render the narrative world beautiful and strange yet entirely comprehensible, as the film depicts an epic chase from humanity’s past.","popularity":0.2087,"poster_path":"/yRZBa833KWePUs2Ox5va8OrpidB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1967-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horse","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Witold Giersz","original_name":"Witold Giersz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53d8bdbdc3a3682c49001ccf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1536611,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kazimierz Serocki","original_name":"Kazimierz Serocki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/y5bajddIeWIJKFOVThmRQkJO8Tw.jpg","credit_id":"61ca0ff837b3a9001d815d0e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280920,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Teresa Kowal","original_name":"Teresa Kowal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca10b0ce9e9100624ec2da","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209914,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Tkaczyk","original_name":"Jan Tkaczyk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca10038813e4001ce05169","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Witold Giersz","original_name":"Witold Giersz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca0ff0a284eb0085cca3bb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836049,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Radlicz","original_name":"Jan Radlicz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ca109be72fe800417e5974","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0425174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Unch2hvINquKE8NTCqumb9YMdL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yRZBa833KWePUs2Ox5va8OrpidB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sXdlhMApRCutLkqmWvi1fdUSCoX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray - Essential Polish Animation","release_date":"2025-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
