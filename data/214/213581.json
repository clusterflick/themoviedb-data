It was first performed in 1977. The play criticizes the Soviet practice of treating political dissidence as a form of mental illness. Its title derives from the popular mnemonic used by music students to remember the notes on the lines of the treble clef.  The filming was undertaken at a live performance at Wembley Conference Centre in April 1978, conducted by Previn.","popularity":0.9705,"poster_path":"/sRs2R6qI9C3Liv3hWrQTdmoSqqp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian McKellen","original_name":"Ian McKellen","popularity":3.1194,"profile_path":"/5cnnnpnJG6TiYUSS7qgJheUZgnv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alexander Ivanov","credit_id":"6505c36efa27f400caa39125","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Kingsley","original_name":"Ben Kingsley","popularity":3.4493,"profile_path":"/vQtBqpF2HDdzbfXHDzR4u37i1Ac.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ivanov","credit_id":"6505c37b109dec00eb15d736","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Windsor","original_name":"Frank Windsor","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/bWPxwFuJE86uudIWizruO6Rb46P.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"6505c388394a8700ff6b9ec3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Woodvine","original_name":"John Woodvine","popularity":0.4526,"profile_path":"/mqNKneqT3W4YEfW35BN1UJ1kJoy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Colonel","credit_id":"6505c391373ac200e21a410b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Leigh-Hunt","original_name":"Barbara Leigh-Hunt","popularity":0.3959,"profile_path":"/mCi9mB0YbB9n4qHsRPF5yGccrft.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Teacher","credit_id":"6505c3a1109dec00eb15d74d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3729123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra","original_name":"Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra","credit_id":"6658c5f94c1ad8d5306c285b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Stoppard","original_name":"Tom Stoppard","popularity":0.264,"profile_path":"/mLkxQBDf3QRx8MhSremy35YcZoC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dc8c3a368484e1fd533","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Bamford","original_name":"Roger Bamford","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dc8c3a368484e1fd539","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Nunn","original_name":"Trevor Nunn","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/uDym6D25yUYim0Ecyd05EJ01lbt.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dc8c3a368484e1fd53f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55982,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Shivas","original_name":"Mark Shivas","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6505c40342d8a500c4fb77e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5805,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Previn","original_name":"André Previn","popularity":0.3559,"profile_path":"/eejlWsguIMSXw1arKn4G5e1uhAx.jpg","credit_id":"6658c5dd057e64121a6c2c53","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0926868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sRs2R6qI9C3Liv3hWrQTdmoSqqp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
