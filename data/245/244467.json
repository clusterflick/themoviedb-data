Political intrigue abounds in a complex upside-down world as militia assassin Mike Wilson unexpectedly decides to renounce the violence his assignment demands, and Homeland Security official Cynthia Porter purposely sabotages a government spying operation she helped create. Consequently, Mike and Cynthia must pay the price for betraying the organizations they had once faithfully served.  Labeled a terrorist by the very people she used to work with, Cynthia faces a personal and professional crisis. Wilson is gunned down by a comrade-in-arms, although his new-found pacifism is passed onto fellow militia member Sam Norton. Now Norton is faced with foiling a terrorist plot to bomb Porters office and rescue her from zealous government agents.","popularity":0.2297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mercer Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What lies between Liberty & Security","title":"UnCivil Liberties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Perkins","original_name":"Penny Perkins","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cynthia Porter","credit_id":"52fe4ef2c3a36847f82b27a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":956289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Craig West","original_name":"Kevin Craig West","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/tBgxwFUSlIvwRMq1tqDih8v7UIs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eric Walker","credit_id":"52fe4ef2c3a36847f82b27a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1219871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Perry","original_name":"Yvonne Perry","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Patricia Porter","credit_id":"52fe4ef2c3a36847f82b27ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1175021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Grocki","original_name":"Tony Grocki","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sam Norton","credit_id":"52fe4ef2c3a36847f82b27af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Musto","original_name":"Mark Musto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bill Sutton","credit_id":"52fe4ef2c3a36847f82b27b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66265,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jennifer Roth","original_name":"Jennifer Roth","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lt.
