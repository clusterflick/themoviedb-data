He spent his life in pursuit of the ideal of beauty, an ideal that found expression in three of the most extraordinary, ornate architectural schemes imaginable - the castle of Neuschwanstein and the palaces of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee. Today, these three buildings are among Germany's biggest tourist attractions.  Dan Cruickshank explores the rich aesthetic of Ludwig II - from the mock-medievalism of Neuschwanstein, the iconic fairytale castle that became the inspiration for the one in Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty, to the rich Baroque splendour of Herrenchiemsee, Ludwig's answer to Versailles. Dan argues that Ludwig's castles are more than flamboyant kitsch and are, in fact, the key to unravelling the eternal enigma of Ludwig II.","popularity":0.2333,"poster_path":"/z7R46yG2pm3Q2n27jfiJFQWh4Vc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fairytale Castles of King Ludwig II","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Fairytale Castles of King Ludwig II with Dan Cruickshank","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Cruickshank","original_name":"Dan Cruickshank","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/xPjt3RGFIgV86loMo40OMKIAIHO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"55c72089c3a3681045000c3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424507,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexander Leith","original_name":"Alexander Leith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d6e6fec3a3683b8f0044bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Cruickshank","original_name":"Dan Cruickshank","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/xPjt3RGFIgV86loMo40OMKIAIHO.jpg","credit_id":"55c720bcc3a3687ed100185d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Basil Comely","original_name":"Basil Comely","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b810779251410d98003648","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Safi Ferrah","original_name":"Safi Ferrah","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b811079251410d98003711","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424507,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexander Leith","original_name":"Alexander Leith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b81057c3a3680ab50088b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668216,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Nicolaides","original_name":"Chris Nicolaides","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b810f09251417bee00424c","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668219,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steven Townsend","original_name":"Steven Townsend","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b81219c3a368358500abe9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668217,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Garner","original_name":"Mike Garner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d020c0c3a368161d00005e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3834096","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mQkPjbzZDqrTYgG45qbMEU3ZSe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z7R46yG2pm3Q2n27jfiJFQWh4Vc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2279,"name":"bavaria, germany"},{"id":3098,"name":"castle"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
