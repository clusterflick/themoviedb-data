When she portrays his wife Nora remembering their time together, Flanagan captures the era and the author in lyrical detail. As Sylvia Beach, the woman who first published Ulysses, new dimensions concerning the importance of Nora in Joyce's literary visions of women emerge, and when Flanagan interprets Joyce characters like Molly Bloom or a washerwoman from Finnegan's Wake, the beauty of Joyce's language shines through the melodious words.","popularity":0.4861,"poster_path":"/vE6IYu8vlNkxMsXtBoURKgys4wv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1985-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Joyce's Women","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fionnula Flanagan","original_name":"Fionnula Flanagan","popularity":1.4838,"profile_path":"/ee3vqFhrmKMRsqqHFLm1rcwGE93.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Harriet Shaw Weaver","credit_id":"5562f42fc3a36851cf0016b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":199742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris O'Neill","original_name":"Chris O'Neill","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/8oTEU1Lph3Rf2AE6dTrxk6qG8KQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"James Joyce","credit_id":"5d742ac0209f185340fb50cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James E.
