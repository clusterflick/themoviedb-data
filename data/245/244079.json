Yet, even after 30 years of success, the groups seven musicians still keep their distance from the world of show-business, and remain deeply committed to helping their countrys development; their professions range from surgeon to farmer, physician to sociologist and member of parliament. Accompanied by the groups rhythmic melodies, the film follows the singers through their daily lives, giving us a glimpse of the far-reaching social and economic problems of the Malagasy people. The combined talents of the Brazilian, Cesar Paes, and the Malagasy, Raymond Rajaonarivelo, have produced a work that is both ethereal and concrete, poetic and political.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/i7On8MkwC3J4QviB2DHpCZ6wssM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laterit Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MG","name":"Madagascar"}],"release_date":"2005-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahaleo","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Mahaleo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mahaleo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dama Mahaleo","original_name":"Dama Mahaleo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63b1f593875d1a00e274db0d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Rajaonarivelo","original_name":"Raymond Rajaonarivelo","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8mkxAJ0I4sMfK2jzyl3PPrt0tN4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4eeac3a36847f82b0909","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"César Paes","original_name":"César Paes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eeac3a36847f82b090f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1124506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Clémence Andriamonta-Paes","original_name":"Marie Clémence Andriamonta-Paes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eeac3a36847f82b0915","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0444247","wikidata_id":"Q3277531","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i7On8MkwC3J4QviB2DHpCZ6wssM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
