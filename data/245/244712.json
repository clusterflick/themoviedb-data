The burst dam sent a wall of water and debris, 40 feet high and half a mile wide, 14 miles downstream to the bustling industrial city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. More than 2000 people lost their lives in the disaster. This documentary tells the story, and tells us that the disaster was easily avoidable.","popularity":0.2241,"poster_path":"/a0ln7BnbSGrj5OC7u614NC1VL9c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guggenheim Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Johnstown Flood","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Len Cariou","original_name":"Len Cariou","popularity":0.766,"profile_path":"/9VJeCcxHkPkN4xH4izmwYHXRMy2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4ef6c3a36847f82b3abf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Guggenheim","original_name":"Charles Guggenheim","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/wrHL8VTsQw6xH13Ikdh2F1DFkAx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ef6c3a36847f82b3abb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097628","wikidata_id":"Q2412262","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a0ln7BnbSGrj5OC7u614NC1VL9c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10617,"name":"disaster"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
