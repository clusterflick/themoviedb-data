The camera catches the subjects indulging in all the (post) modern lifestyle trends: drugs, kinky sex, hip-hop, fashion, exhibitionism, narcissism. They are uninhibited, the kind of youth who break down barriers in a supposedly traditional and religious society, but perhaps that's just on the surface. Behind the upbeat tone is a probing examination of values and attitudes in modern youth relationships. Happiness may be deceptive but there's certainly a lot of fun in the Happy Berry.","popularity":0.0927,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Berry","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chatthip Chanlertfa","original_name":"Chatthip Chanlertfa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tird","credit_id":"52fe4eefc3a36847f82b1c25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanwimon Nuntavijarn","original_name":"Wanwimon Nuntavijarn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gack","credit_id":"52fe4eefc3a36847f82b1c29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roampol Rochanakit","original_name":"Roampol Rochanakit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jo","credit_id":"52fe4eefc3a36847f82b1c2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chayathip Rungpungtong","original_name":"Chayathip Rungpungtong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Koi","credit_id":"52fe4eefc3a36847f82b1c31","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thunska Pansittivorakul","original_name":"Thunska Pansittivorakul","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/3I3N2QMtaVmRiwVuex8g4bP3hrM.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4eefc3a36847f82b1c21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279551,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sopon Sukdapsit","original_name":"Sopon Sukdapsit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eefc3a36847f82b1c37","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0411466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
