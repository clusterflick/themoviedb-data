Their joint area of responsibility is the youngest children's performance.  However the two directors have different personalities and priorities. Their co-operation is less than friction-free as the pressure leading up to the performance increases. The two find that they work no better together as adults than they did as children. However there is still a bit of a spark between them.  Will they manage to finish the production in time for the grand opening in front of the country's Leader? Are the children up for the challenge? Will any romance come out of all this....","popularity":0.0595,"poster_path":"/g9PuviyVHCSsYZ4X6oMFUS1OnDu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Korean Film","origin_country":""},{"id":45495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joseon Yeonghwa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KP","name":"North Korea"}],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Green Carpet","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KP","title":"푸른 주단우에서","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On the Green Carpet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyong-hi Ri","original_name":"Gyong-hi Ri","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5202ad92514149ab4db784","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yong-ho Ri","original_name":"Yong-ho Ri","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5202cf0e0a264965dc5290","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang-bom Rim","original_name":"Chang-bom Rim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eedc3a36847f82b141b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kwang-il Jon","original_name":"Kwang-il Jon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eedc3a36847f82b1421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2162703","wikidata_id":"Q13655873","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g9PuviyVHCSsYZ4X6oMFUS1OnDu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
