Whilst on a trip to a hill station, they meet a 5 year old girl who takes them to her home and exposes an unknown truth - the little girl Dolly is Shyam's own daughter by Radha. Rukmini rises to the occasion as a great woman and accepts and adopts Radha as a second wife of Shyam and Dolly as their daughter, without caring for society and the law. They live happily under one roof until Dolly falls in love with a high society advocate's son Amit. But society doesn't accept Dolly and charges her of being a illegal child and they must face both social and legal barriers as well as family turmoil in a fight to be together.","popularity":0.3082,"poster_path":"/ySnlE4kfNdUIPsh3r5qraMpnazY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Souten Ki Beti","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rekha","original_name":"Rekha","popularity":0.9491,"profile_path":"/fTXd5QlWck5CDxijM56YXx2Crob.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Radha Verma","credit_id":"67c0fabbb0c5684bada23d5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":616995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeetendra","original_name":"Jeetendra","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/i1D38TUK4JynQHq0hgihFkD61ba.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Shyam Shankar Verma","credit_id":"52fe4ef6c3a36847f82b3c2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaya Prada","original_name":"Jaya Prada","popularity":1.14,"profile_path":"/annu4gnsyB8uGC7ipgNfXQVCbK6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rukmini S.
