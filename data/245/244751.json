Immersed in her own pointed, charismatic writings, this engrossing profile follows Anderson's inspiring life and travels. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.","popularity":0.2188,"poster_path":"/abFJ0FX0FYVaz1C6sxm3HguT256.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Imagining: Margaret Anderson and the 'Little Review'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4786813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia E.
