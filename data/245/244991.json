The father donates the boy's red jacket to charity, where it ends up in war-torn Sarajevo. The boy's parents are killed, and he almost is. Some UN soldiers find him, and send him to a hospital in Germany. He escapes the hospital, is hit by a car (but unhurt). The driver reads the tag inside the jacket and \"returns\" the boy to the grieving father.","popularity":0.1444,"poster_path":"/dzLOn0G5wWKbK5NIj2Mehr7sdsK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Jacket","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Noethen","original_name":"Ulrich Noethen","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/wetpWDhR88VBNXq1vjq6JT8N4O1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vater","credit_id":"5862c6adc3a36852c3001949","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catrin Striebeck","original_name":"Catrin Striebeck","popularity":0.3198,"profile_path":"/1kCWfjrgwYanY5TxRRveGqrhKAe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Autofahrerin","credit_id":"5862c6dd9251412b84001830","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetje Mierendorf","original_name":"Tetje Mierendorf","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/zIGVpWMVLDKXoQC6yNCNKELtx2T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"DRK-Helfer","credit_id":"5862c6f39251412b900018f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Hochmair","original_name":"Philipp Hochmair","popularity":0.3139,"profile_path":"/2nY333AmRI3Rz38km7wZ37BLPwf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"UN - Sanit√§ter 1","credit_id":"5862c7059251412b90001906","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Baxmeyer","original_name":"Florian Baxmeyer","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":"/jZ3tX1KkIFx8lJHbDVBJWc5trsn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4efac3a36847f82b5031","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323844","wikidata_id":"Q1219180","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":940,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dzLOn0G5wWKbK5NIj2Mehr7sdsK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":625}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
