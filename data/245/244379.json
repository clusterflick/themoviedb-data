Shot on location in various parts of the world, it depicts children in the Philippines who can neither hear nor speak, a brain-damaged child in India, an Ethiopian cripple learning a trade so that he can support his family with dignity, and a Mexican polio victim, whose mother uses therapy to help her daughter walk. Also featured is Terry Fox, the Canadian youth who lost his right leg to cancer and yet set out to run across Canada. The world of the disabled is not a special world, but the same world in which we all live.
