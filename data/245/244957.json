Henry and directed by Peter Riegert, starring Garret Dillahunt, Claire Lautier and Joey Temperini. It follows two lovers who are no longer speaking. As articulate and intelligent as they are, they can’t breach this gap without the “poetic” assistance of a 13-year-old from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film.","popularity":0.5546,"poster_path":"/gKAKSqnehTnlMLFFaawu4pSoFWK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Courier","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garret Dillahunt","original_name":"Garret Dillahunt","popularity":1.7299,"profile_path":"/4L9bdqQIdfrtqR7JQdsIhlF3Fjk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4efac3a36847f82b4d83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Lautier","original_name":"Claire Lautier","popularity":0.3078,"profile_path":"/eFhXJhon5Q9VEAvLJwrcIWFCW8j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4efac3a36847f82b4d87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Temperini","original_name":"Joey Temperini","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4efac3a36847f82b4d8b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Riegert","original_name":"Peter Riegert","popularity":0.7338,"profile_path":"/yPgaRZBMVy9eoNNuiPIm0wzG9sD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4efac3a36847f82b4d7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2479261,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ericka Frederick","original_name":"Ericka Frederick","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5def15fbdaf57c0019efa007","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0278378","wikidata_id":"Q22322780","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKAKSqnehTnlMLFFaawu4pSoFWK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2001-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
