It captures the normal conflicts of early childhood -- the quick changes from happiness to sorrow, from cooperative play to tears and arguments -- all the while keeping these conflicts in perspective; showing them within the framework of the joy that the boys find in each other's presence. A wonderful children's film that enchants adults as well.","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":"/6qJuow5JXyv5HRUi6c9ICvxeogM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Brother, My Brother","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274158,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ross Lowell","original_name":"Ross Lowell","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e13b47dd8af670012bfce78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Lowell","original_name":"Carol Lowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e13b4896c0b360011ffe9a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0079656","wikidata_id":"Q22322361","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6qJuow5JXyv5HRUi6c9ICvxeogM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
