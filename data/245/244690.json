Both artists and residents of the Detroit suburbs, they met on a group tour of England after being widowed, and quickly formed a strong connection over shared interests. The two discuss concerns over living together without being married; Louis also talks about his caring for his first wife during her ten-year struggle with Alzheimer's disease, while Reva talks about the deaths of two sons several years after her husband's death.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/gf2WxbgSRfomwFEUW6eYvDC56B8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young at Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279971,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pamela Conn","original_name":"Pamela Conn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ef5c3a36847f82b39b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sue Marx","original_name":"Sue Marx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ef5c3a36847f82b39b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sue Marx","original_name":"Sue Marx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5770368cc3a3683733001d2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279971,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pamela Conn","original_name":"Pamela Conn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57703697c3a3686a93000ef6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0094363","wikidata_id":"Q1352243","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gf2WxbgSRfomwFEUW6eYvDC56B8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
