Focusing on how nails are made, we first see a blacksmith laboring at his forge, shaping nails from single strands of steel rods. The scene then shifts from this peaceful setting to the roar of a 20th century nail mill, where banks of machines draw, cut, and pound the steel rods faster than the eye can follow.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/qDzFZ2ZCwWjVha8X93Ufygwcfgz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nails","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Borsos","original_name":"Phillip Borsos","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/nhILe7p2AU0c4ShqyeAmb8OpZfM.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ef0c3a36847f82b2153","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":78638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Hall","original_name":"Raymond Hall","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7cc3d4d861af2f0ab7f291","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":194795,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ron Orieux","original_name":"Ron Orieux","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7cc3c7ab1bc75874c26f22","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0079608","wikidata_id":"Q1963843","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvpswXEjhki7nouxAr1j2g9tQP3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qDzFZ2ZCwWjVha8X93Ufygwcfgz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cork Film Festival","release_date":"1980-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
