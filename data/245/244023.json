The everyday situations that many commercials are made of, the little dramas that they create and solve through the product or service they sell, are stitched together into one day. This is a film about the everyday in (German, or Western-European) society because the commercials are part of the everyday of most people (everyone who watches television) and they depict an ideal image of society.  The film abundantly uses repetition as an editing technique, in visual ways as described above, but also because commercials can be read in different ways. For instance, Brat baking foil shows up at the evening dinner sequence, when an ovendish is put on the table, and again later on in the sequence about going out to a classic concert, because the clip has classic music.","popularity":0.5268,"poster_path":"/7pFTo99SjT3FdEw92li75Jvunte.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day in the Life of a Consumer","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ein Tag im Leben des Endverbrauchers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ee9c3a36847f82b02d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3953898,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Petzold","original_name":"Christian Petzold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6407ff789f51af00991265b6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0361036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7pFTo99SjT3FdEw92li75Jvunte.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/i1oKka7f5Ehj773RmdBsDq1VljB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/fbdfcAGSVnP4S30MKyUdnnM3ExY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10907,"name":"consumerism"},{"id":15086,"name":"advertising"},{"id":33935,"name":"tv commercial"},{"id":216791,"name":"advertisement"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
