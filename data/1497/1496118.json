In the second part of the film, a technique of double exposure, the superimposition of color negative and positive, is used as a kind of transfiguration of the situation. (...)  Stoned Vienna was made around the same time as ViennaFilm 1896-1976 by Ernst Schmidt jr. That's why there are a number of parallels that came about by chance. A repeatedly exposed scene, the wax doll Dolly, a symbol of the way Vienna is treated, was made available to Ernst Schmidt jr. as a contribution to his ViennaFilm.
