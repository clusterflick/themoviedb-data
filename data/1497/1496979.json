A lunar eclipse. A forgotten corner of West Virginia.  What begins as a weekend camping trip for three college students quickly unravels into something far more disturbing. As strange phenomena disrupt their recordings, they find themselves caught in a web of folklore, conspiracy, and terror buried deep in the Appalachian hills. With only a camera to document what’s unfolding around them, the line between myth and reality begins to blur.  Told entirely through recovered footage, Project Butterfly: Flatwoods is a chilling descent into the unknown, where every glitch, shadow, and silence holds a warning. Inspired by real West Virginia legends, this film invites you to witness what was never meant to be seen.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":221694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felinton Incorporated Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some legends aren’t meant to be documented.","title":"Project Butterfly: Flatwoods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xander Alvarez","original_name":"Xander Alvarez","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Zachary Atkins","credit_id":"684b2470d374eef39f3fd881","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5501150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Pallay","original_name":"Catherine Pallay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Elise Miller","credit_id":"684b24ca5aa37572d4294298","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5501151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Mattingly","original_name":"Charlie Mattingly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jacob Miller","credit_id":"684b24daf33177836c5c708e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5003803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeline Dalesio","original_name":"Madeline Dalesio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Edith Burkhammer","credit_id":"684b24e8104285654a1be557","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5501152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greyson Grimmett","original_name":"Greyson Grimmett","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bRrLPUNOhSaGdSp47A7z0F8erqE.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"David Ray","credit_id":"684b24f2e9853a7c1ebb421c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5501197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kailea Goff","original_name":"Kailea Goff","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/o6bBEc1U15j66aIygo6nrYGSCya.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Leah Blevins","credit_id":"684b2a098b0c3d1c03b0d66e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4555213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Felinton","original_name":"Samuel Felinton","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/uWlLMOJnXpx0nQLxIPx3GOhZ97J.jpg","credit_id":"684ae0f269c9feb7829f5f8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500677,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Koltin Davis","original_name":"Koltin Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ae1093f83a7a421bb4077","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Damien Dennis","original_name":"Damien Dennis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ae1128458a830ea302be0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5492909,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Declan Mungovan","original_name":"Declan Mungovan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ae11b4bcc38bcd8302b6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5492909,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Declan Mungovan","original_name":"Declan Mungovan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ae123bca14429d5b0d4c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500677,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Koltin Davis","original_name":"Koltin Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684ae12d70e868b880b0d525","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4555213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Felinton","original_name":"Samuel Felinton","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/uWlLMOJnXpx0nQLxIPx3GOhZ97J.jpg","credit_id":"684ae1384cff3224bc1eb960","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4555213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Felinton","original_name":"Samuel Felinton","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/uWlLMOJnXpx0nQLxIPx3GOhZ97J.jpg","credit_id":"684ae1457cd73b09685c6fd5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36819870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":266866,"name":"cryptid"},{"id":294886,"name":"flatwoods monster"},{"id":353486,"name":"west virgina"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
