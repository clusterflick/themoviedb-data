This is the story of Quinn Whiteman and Harvey Davenport, two down and out roommates barely existing in the L.A. suburban hellscape of mid-1990's North Hollywood. Quinn is looking for love, as well as another menial job to replace the one he just lost, while Harvey deals with two big concerns; expiring unemployment insurance and an unexplainable penile problem.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7D0Xwt7FQs3uFqcKLr274sKPnso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NoHo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7D0Xwt7FQs3uFqcKLr274sKPnso.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":901}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
