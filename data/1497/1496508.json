Chamonix natives Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard set out on the afternoon of August 7 and returned victorious on the morning of the 9th, after two nights spent outdoors. This film is a staging that reconstructs this great event with all the problems it created and resolved, thus contributing to the emergence of the modern concept of mountaineering. Denis Ducroz, guide and filmmaker, immerses us in the minds and times of these two men, 224 years later.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/j0CH4fEjp7zlTdjnZNldQEygZjw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1117,"logo_path":"/2X2uFeObxawiAajNDOf3Mhri5Wg.png","name":"Antenne 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unfamous of Mont Blanc","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"المجهولون في مونت بلانك","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Minthe","original_name":"Paul Minthe","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/dfxT4vfX6gswRxBEZUriS9cr6q0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6849db7cc8bf37e3a43e0aff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Voïta","original_name":"Michel Voïta","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/sSNUp70P6nAInUxR2uXv6otFz4W.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6849e1b7ef546c95c5293bf0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Abraham-Kremer","original_name":"Bruno Abraham-Kremer","popularity":0.2802,"profile_path":"/h8cedfVnEVnFakLVWXwOLmrVTvy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6849dba9f0993891e43fd42a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Crombé","original_name":"Laurence Crombé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6849dbbb8d1f28663e3fd620","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2503277,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Denis Ducroz","original_name":"Denis Ducroz","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/npW3R6abWtmrFvtKS4yDUZY7A2q.jpg","credit_id":"6849db5a55d594d3a69f5b7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2503277,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Denis Ducroz","original_name":"Denis Ducroz","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/npW3R6abWtmrFvtKS4yDUZY7A2q.jpg","credit_id":"6849db602f55759388302787","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37268797","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLgorlhUzYc3Lo8cZg6OgpBnQD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bjH5VGNg6gnVtmlYpmyDt0bPTzp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0CH4fEjp7zlTdjnZNldQEygZjw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":299404,"name":"mountain documentary"},{"id":309140,"name":"mont blanc"},{"id":316125,"name":"alps"},{"id":353433,"name":"alpinism pionneers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
