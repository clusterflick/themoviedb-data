They packed all the equipment into a car, drove 700 kilometres from Kyiv to the frontline city Kramatorsk, and turned one of many basements which serve as shelters into a makeshift recording studio. As a result, they recorded over 300 minutes of music, which were eventually distilled into a 90-minute album.","popularity":0.1357,"poster_path":"/1VD85DCM9X4ClkNHGeu5ZhV9KHb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Making of Basement 626","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myshko Birchenko","original_name":"Myshko Birchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6849d9e687de1c0fd8de7f28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevhen Puhachov","original_name":"Yevhen Puhachov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6849d9f62c399022f01eb40c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryna Pleshcheieva","original_name":"Maryna Pleshcheieva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6849e377bc04bf9bb63fd85d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrii Pleshcheiev","original_name":"Andrii Pleshcheiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6849e42e5ca95ae716302613","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Pinyagin","original_name":"Vadim Pinyagin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6849d986884f6aa1ec9f5b5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Khomych","original_name":"Daniel Khomych","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6849d9c0ec73293cd7bb3e03","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499052,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrii Shakhadynets","original_name":"Andrii Shakhadynets","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6849da90789ef510931eb61b","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Pinyagin","original_name":"Vadim Pinyagin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6849eebd24c39ef4e51eb87f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5499044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Pinyagin","original_name":"Vadim Pinyagin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6849eee9631b06539a1eb710","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Hf8YZdgTZt0Vfr3K11pNQXJeZN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1VD85DCM9X4ClkNHGeu5ZhV9KHb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":14529,"name":"improvisation"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":252606,"name":"russian invasion of ukraine (2022)"},{"id":272265,"name":"ukraine"},{"id":272691,"name":"ukrainian"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":351657,"name":"recording an album"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hyphen Dash – The Making of Basement 626","key":"VjQL9e4AvuA","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-05T16:59:23.000Z","id":"6849ef75f0993891e43fd499"}]}}}
