His inability to fall asleep is the vehicle that invites us to a journey through liminal and nocturnal spaces of Buenos Aires, crossed by fragmented scenes of everyday life. A bird, the copy of a famous painting and the memories of that bond will be entangled between the sordidness, the emptiness and the feeling of unreality to remain eternally awake.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2l9kwZpjpuBkqEUsDkI64lmPC3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un petirrojo en la habitación","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás M.
