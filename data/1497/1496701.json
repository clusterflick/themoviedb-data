The gaze, like a boat, wanders, guided by the leaves of the trees against the sky. The images of an easily observable commonality, which was once commonplace at first glance, make the journey an encounter with a nature that is both close and distant. A landscape in extinction, a wandering gaze in an increasingly unlikely act: seeing what moves around. Walden Street is a road movie suspended in time by how we look at screens.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jKJk3uNh0RfEsJnESH2XHe6Smdy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walden Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1528,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jKJk3uNh0RfEsJnESH2XHe6Smdy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1019}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
