Hester, a beautiful young Englishwoman, is sent to America by her husband, with a promise that he will follow on the next ship. But he falls to keep his promise and Hester does not hear from him in years. In the meantime she is befriended by a young Puritan minister. Friendship ripens into love and Hester, thinking her husband dead, loves the handsome young clergyman with her whole heart. But when the baby is born the minister, fearing the wrath of the Pilgrim Fathers, denies it and Hester is condemned to wear the Scarlet Letter and to stand in the pillory. And it is only after several years of Hester's shame and ignominy that the little child finally reaches the father's heart. Then comes the great scene. The minister, on a fÃªte day, ascends the pillory, places himself where Hester had been placed, and publicly proclaims his sin.","popularity":0.1511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scarlet Letter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1056792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Gauntier","original_name":"Gene Gauntier","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/tjbAFbVpKK2V0lvwiIsecoecf7U.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hester Prynne","credit_id":"5e580b9535811d001761c217","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Conway","original_name":"Jack Conway","popularity":0.3204,"profile_path":"/eMA6PQ0OEnAZM9wZjkflrAO3rkL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e580b9cf48b3400197945fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Roland","original_name":"Ruth Roland","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/jANjK6xntsIsuAeG2UE44kc7W6k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e580ba235811d0019612aae","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","original_name":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/k4vBmTyciyq0A6ouYUTM5qSP0HA.jpg","credit_id":"5e580b79a93d25001753b1b4","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Olcott","original_name":"Sidney Olcott","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/6Eym8aO1nG6jDTR7Fk5UbqcpieM.jpg","credit_id":"5e580b828e2ba60017ec2d1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1056792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Gauntier","original_name":"Gene Gauntier","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/tjbAFbVpKK2V0lvwiIsecoecf7U.jpg","credit_id":"5e580b8c35811d00155f8751","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234671","wikidata_id":"Q3989139","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
