'A musician must make affirmations,' says Davis. 'If a musician cannot believe in music as a universal ideal, what is he left with? We may be encircled by gloom but music gives us a chance to throw what Meredith calls \"that faint thin line upon the shore\". ... Beethoven is a man at war with himself but a man who is determined to win.'","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/mctykZoeVeNuUckkeaQ3g4hsyPX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven: Missa Solemnis - Sir Colin Davis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Davis","original_name":"Colin Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bzeZgEDAEmpHGerdCDRIAEmh70F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5e58b456a93d25001a5497ac","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mctykZoeVeNuUckkeaQ3g4hsyPX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":716}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
