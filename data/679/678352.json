Old animals that would have normally been put down are given a chance to live out the rest of their lives - but they must also endure the trials of aging. Through the struggles of a blind shepherding dog, and a wheelchair-bound Chihuahua, difficult questions come to the fore: were these elderly, disabled animals meant to live? At the brink of death, there are no easy answers.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/k1ixxd5vgIKIqHaNUCaFKItU4jD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Stop in Santa Rosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Lo","original_name":"Elizabeth Lo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/TsQr3Vu2Pjg0cP0iwPTiGyPyPz.jpg","credit_id":"5e581363f48b3400137a45fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3499188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k1ixxd5vgIKIqHaNUCaFKItU4jD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
