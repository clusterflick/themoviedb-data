The mountains of Donegal are depicted like fairytale characters, where the hero Mount Errigal competes with neighbouring villain Mount Muckish. A fantastical narrative explains that the landscape is ‘a battleground where the weapons are the elements themselves’. Dramatic footage of storms and lightning blends with a superb score by Irish composer Brian Boydell.","popularity":0.0708,"poster_path":"/ePDnaVeVNisCHINJrezZttauqT6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aengus Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":178058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roinn Na Gaeltachta","origin_country":""},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1970-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Errigal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ann Chegwidden","original_name":"Ann Chegwidden","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cab5060398ab008e238c86","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3052344,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivien Carey","original_name":"Vivien Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cab528006b01007b928d63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"63cab52fbb070d00c8a138da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"63cab4f0ed96bc007b502e60","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carey","original_name":"Patrick Carey","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/itqTfFUNdL6bZ9m4DtmxJuFYPkj.jpg","credit_id":"5e578583f48b340019786b9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551322,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Boydell","original_name":"Brian Boydell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e579fe3a6d93100145d2c2e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12038204","wikidata_id":"Q123287517","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ePDnaVeVNisCHINJrezZttauqT6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.641,"height":780,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Akr7JNR0S5CYtqKwSg09aFW1kut.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hGhaq2xZc7mkKJTKPVqJvSX5IuU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
