Filmmaker Marshall Woodworth recounts his childhood when boucheries, cochon de lait, and Creole French were a more dominant cultural force, contrasting that against the dearth of fluent French speakers in Louisiana today. Along the way, Woodworth interviews a rich range of elders, French Immersion instructors, sociologists, and—potentially the key to Creole French’s future—musicians.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Veille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marshall Woodworth","original_name":"Marshall Woodworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5815158e2ba60013ec44a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8688632","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La Veille TRAILER","key":"Rgo7npsmNx4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-14T06:22:30.000Z","id":"5e5815590398ab0016a17a2e"}]}}}
