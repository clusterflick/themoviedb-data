S. Eliot, between the image and the word falls a shadow. Within that shadow, hidden from view, is a spirit that connects us all, beneath the skin. LAS BRUJAS is a personal vision of displacement, home, memory, literature and the relationship between personal and collective history through the ethos of collage.
