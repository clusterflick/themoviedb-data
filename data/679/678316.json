Cuba captured Ernest Hemingway's fertile imagination and inspired him to create now-legendary fictional characters: Harry Morgan of To Have and Have Not, Thomas Hudson of Islands in the Stream and Santiago of The Old Man and the Sea. The program travels to Cuba to capture Hemingway's old haunts — many of which remain unchanged — and explores Hemingway's real-life adventures in Cuba, from his passion for marlin fishing and safari hunting, as well as the influence of his wives and lovers on his life and work. HEMINGWAY IN CUBA presents archival footage and includes interviews with Cuban scholars and Hemingway biographers who discuss how Cuba’s culture, religion and even its volatile politics influenced this legendary American author.","popularity":0.3165,"poster_path":"/ytUguN29GlvJ7VHQUHtM4OMfYQg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129789,"logo_path":null,"name":"WGCU Public Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hemingway in Cuba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Lindsay","original_name":"Jeff Lindsay","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5e57f4438e2ba60017ec09f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Sklodowski","original_name":"Bill Sklodowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e57f639a6d93100145dbf8e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551611,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carlene Brennen","original_name":"Carlene Brennen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f4a8a6d93100165d6261","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hilary Hemmingway","original_name":"Hilary Hemmingway","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f4f18e2ba60013ec0c55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hilary Hemmingway","original_name":"Hilary Hemmingway","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f4d435811d00135f6922","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Lesko","original_name":"Susan Lesko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f48f35811d00135f6799","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551616,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tim Kenney","original_name":"Tim Kenney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f6028e2ba60013ec0dd2","department":"Camera","job":"Videojournalist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathleen Davey","original_name":"Kathleen Davey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f5b0a93d25001a535923","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551615,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheri Coleman","original_name":"Sheri Coleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f5ce8e2ba60013ec0d82","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551606,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Price","original_name":"Brian Price","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e57f40af48b340015797e98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fzNn5ccL52TLhknQy0XFN7c11P2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytUguN29GlvJ7VHQUHtM4OMfYQg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":185018,"name":"autobiographical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
