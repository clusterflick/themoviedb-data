The woman is run down by a ghostly Land Rover and disappears. Meanwhile, her beau comes to a big old house where he is taken in by an old and lonely man. It doesn't take long for the young man to realize that his host is wacko and terrified of dying and is willing to take extreme measures to prevent this from happening. Though billed as a thriller, director Michael Ferry chose to focus on the inner thoughts and fears of the protagonists rather than exciting action sequences. All of the violence occurs off screen.","popularity":0.1523,"poster_path":"/uCNzSw3LKVaD9ph4XCl3vk0x12w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hantises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Berry","original_name":"John Berry","popularity":0.3233,"profile_path":"/7R31d8lYcCRomWfnwf3b8p0Ae0F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ernest","credit_id":"630c4e8cd051d9007bf105d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207303,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francis Boespflug","original_name":"Francis Boespflug","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Le docteur","credit_id":"630c4e960398ab0082a0857d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Golovine","original_name":"Marina Golovine","popularity":0.1347,"profile_path":"/AfAIp3lBmV3hSUD84Q1bZHd7nZf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marine","credit_id":"630c4ea0ca7ec6007bcd7d3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Négret","original_name":"François Négret","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/eX9JSG8RHAhFf8d1CMn3yeJMvrW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Vincent","credit_id":"630c4ea963536a0082733662","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":19059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Ferry","original_name":"Michel Ferry","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da8e9259e8a900e2272e70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516178,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean Coudsi","original_name":"Jean Coudsi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da8e5dd100b600c5d2b64c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19114,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brigitte Taillandier","original_name":"Brigitte Taillandier","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/9UrbeJpxvmi0SAuN5a98RIoF3jE.jpg","credit_id":"64da8e83f495ee0291a07b32","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58212,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Ferry","original_name":"Christian Ferry","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da8e117719d7013dd66490","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19055,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emmanuelle Castro","original_name":"Emmanuelle Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da8e50f495ee0291a07b16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215348,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel Cuotemoc Malle","original_name":"Manuel Cuotemoc Malle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da8e3559e8a900ac06d838","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19070,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Corinne Jorry","original_name":"Corinne Jorry","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da8e76d100b600c5d2b658","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy de Maupassant","original_name":"Guy de Maupassant","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/5TnxaJOQcUI3ysXUvstMXfm4bJP.jpg","credit_id":"6334657e7f0540007ab1c5a3","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":19059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Ferry","original_name":"Michel Ferry","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c28705dc3a3683a66d3a601","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0119252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uCNzSw3LKVaD9ph4XCl3vk0x12w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
