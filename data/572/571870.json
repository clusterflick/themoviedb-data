In Dieter Dorn’s production, the characters are real people of flesh and blood, their emotions and conflicts intelligible to every member of the audience. The cast includes some of the finest Mozart singers of our day, headed by the British tenor John Mark Ainsley in the title role, while Kent Nagano in the orchestra pit appears to unleash an elemental force of nature.","popularity":0.0904,"poster_path":"/5KwMy6qr70oTUeKqZYzncyNHKcQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Idomeneo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mark Ainsley","original_name":"John Mark Ainsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2KAhaXG8ODy8mLZIn65M6RPXByo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Idomeneo","credit_id":"5c2a55630e0a26541c386a4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavol Breslik","original_name":"Pavol Breslik","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/1klDGmAOvQLE7Xrz951vRZZDXuZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Idamante","credit_id":"5c2a5574c3a36802a9d1054b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliane Banse","original_name":"Juliane Banse","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ilia","credit_id":"5c2a559c925141424dbdfb1a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Dasch","original_name":"Annette Dasch","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elettra","credit_id":"5c2a55c30e0a267930394e75","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Trost","original_name":"Rainer Trost","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Arbace","credit_id":"5c2a55d40e0a262e65346158","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy De Mey","original_name":"Guy De Mey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gran Sacerdote di Nettuno","credit_id":"5c2a55f70e0a267930394e9b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kent Nagano","original_name":"Kent Nagano","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/rghOfYl9H5zMgfGqJdWSCZtPS8U.jpg","credit_id":"5c2a565c0e0a26791f3959b9","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5KwMy6qr70oTUeKqZYzncyNHKcQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xhg0qSPWIv9Bh31ljMYHXGdbBTT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
