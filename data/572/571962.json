He's spotted by the assailant, but Slimami manages to slip away before being caught. The victim turned out to be a prominent businessman, and police are soon searching for the witness as well as the killers. Slimami does not want to step forward, both as a matter of personal safety and because he prefers to let the French police handle their own affairs. His son Alilou, a budding journalist, openly decries the failure of the witness to come forward as a black mark on the Muslim community in Paris, unaware that the man in question is his father.","popularity":0.1344,"poster_path":"/pfDxi0xQ4EMiPvNl7WfaMW1MsV7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night of Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Volter","original_name":"Philippe Volter","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/64YFCcB1D6FfPV7WE8OTEf2WP2V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"630c6609d051d9007ec8105c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Terral","original_name":"Boris Terral","popularity":0.1681,"profile_path":"/7ysEbxq29XtI5wR3sXG7cVHHXfy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"630c661466ae4d0082487598","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gamil Ratib","original_name":"Gamil Ratib","popularity":0.3095,"profile_path":"/9ZNYtVH3LAq5UtGVnyPZvoKqlSp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"630c661f66ae4d007d8e2784","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Mankaï","original_name":"Sonia Mankaï","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/5ISL9zZOgLUXXwcpynAERGdfy4e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"630c662623bcf400926ab26a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdelkrim Bahloul","original_name":"Abdelkrim Bahloul","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/nRujpXoaCXlx6IzDT1RabHmc9nV.jpg","credit_id":"5ead4d4e0c3ec80025cb8fb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0198854","wikidata_id":"Q24938580","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfDxi0xQ4EMiPvNl7WfaMW1MsV7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
