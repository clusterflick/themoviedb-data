A study of colour, stasis, and different modes of multiple-exposure. The film slides from a doctored reality towards fantasy. A large part of the film takes place in one single image that continually changes aspect: the buildings on the square, Place d'Italie, seen from my window from when I used to live in that district in Paris on the eighth floor of a kind of council housing block.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/fcJ2SVwusDhjABkXuajON1von0e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regard de ma fenêtre","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Red Sunshine","original_name":"Red Sunshine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"631b0c4f77b1fb0088fea4aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694079,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Lecamus","original_name":"Denis Lecamus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631b0c6491f0ea007a52dbe9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119269,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Reich","original_name":"Steve Reich","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/74RqDTZoQHYE40VpIoLIoNqLCPH.jpg","credit_id":"631b0c70aafebd00919833cc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmet Kut","original_name":"Ahmet Kut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2abee0c3a3682919a04d3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1196233","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fcJ2SVwusDhjABkXuajON1von0e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
