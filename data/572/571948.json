The editing was composed on a score because the shots are generally very short, up to two images, and they do not follow each other \"cut\" or crossed but in \"racket\". The progression of shots varies from faintly colored recognizable to strongly colored unrecognizable. The soundtrack is composed of Arabic music that gradually turns into free-jazz. » Mannheim Festival, 1973","popularity":0.3189,"poster_path":"/1OPKXPwc1imu4GfG7a3ap3MJ263.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Algérie Couleurs","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2205533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djouhra Abouda","original_name":"Djouhra Abouda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/htWsn6uaJiJGWik5beR9liKLvLq.jpg","credit_id":"5c2aaf9ac3a3682915a032bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2205534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Bonnamy","original_name":"Alain Bonnamy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2aafa5c3a3682915a032cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/47q3YbvhfZjarSHCfyHfZHlC6bu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1OPKXPwc1imu4GfG7a3ap3MJ263.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1210,"iso_639_1":"ne","file_path":"/1MHWosW0N7YFmHVjP58g9dVFwhe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":813}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156123,"name":"algiers, algeria"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":246960,"name":"post colonialism"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"},{"id":320910,"name":"post-independance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
