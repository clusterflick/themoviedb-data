The U.S. space program suffered a bitter setback when Apollo 1 ended in a deadly fire during a pre-launch run-through. In disarray, and threatened by the prospect of a Soviet Union victory in the space race, NASA decided upon a radical and risky change of plan: turn Apollo 8 from an earth-orbit mission into a daring sprint to the moon while relying on untried new technologies. Fifty years after the historic mission, the Apollo 8 astronauts and engineers recount the feats of engineering that paved the way to the moon.","popularity":0.354,"poster_path":"/68nKc4nSfyDzvGORoCDqGpkOtG5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Apollo astronauts and engineers tell the inside story of the first manned mission to the moon.","title":"Apollo's Daring Mission","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/79AWDmUkSunBKntdjzQrQrMTlsL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1380,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/68nKc4nSfyDzvGORoCDqGpkOtG5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTLQVVEjjCkWuhIcEZftYZNvVNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":305,"name":"moon"},{"id":1432,"name":"nasa"},{"id":191132,"name":"space exploration"},{"id":226233,"name":"apollo program"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
