Two women filmmakers recover twenty forgotten rolls of Super8 that showed the journey of two Galicians to different places of Japan in 1973, and with this material, and the reflections and emotions of his owner watching the rolls for the first time (the son of the travelers) with her wife, that is Japanish and could not know her father in law that died soon after that trip, these two filmmakers give birth to a new story seeking suggestive relations between the two countries (half of the film is filmed by them in Galicia, also in Super8). This filmmakers during the process of making this film are reading a book of haikus of Basho, that wrote in his lyrical diary \"Oku no Oshomichi\" about the beauty of some of the places where this Galician couple went to visit in their trip to Japan many centuries later. So some passages of this travelogue are included too.","popularity":0.2693,"poster_path":"/2k9OMotkr8HiqVJ3Xo7CxgbCGRg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aimless Wanderer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anxela Caramés","original_name":"Anxela Caramés","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c261689c3a36872fac2ef9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2203284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xisela Franco","original_name":"Xisela Franco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c261661c3a36872fac2ef56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2k9OMotkr8HiqVJ3Xo7CxgbCGRg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":641}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":266284,"name":"cinemagalego"},{"id":266285,"name":"galiza"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
