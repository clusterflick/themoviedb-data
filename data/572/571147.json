The soundtrack, which consists of a voice speaking the single words ‘house', ‘woman', ‘head' and ‘breath', intensifies the feeling of slowness, heaviness and materiality. The camera seems like a body let loose on its surroundings, concentrating on just a few objects, processes and views as it slowly feels its way around. The voice, in turn, appears to represent a kind of interior dialogue, a ‘body within a body'.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body within the Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Herold","original_name":"Jörg Herold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2548b6925141418ddec6b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
