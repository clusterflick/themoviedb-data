Suddenly, Mia can see electricity, leap off rooftops and save people’s lives. But as Mia’s superpowers grow, so does her awareness of looming danger.

And while Mia tries to save everybody from the imminent crisis, it's her own stability which seems to be put at stake.","popularity":0.3088,"poster_path":"/3QEnGX0XQLPt2HNod7OG6DQBPTg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wüste
