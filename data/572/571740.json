The spectacle of the World’s finest drivers, cornering on the limit at 180mph and under G-forces often exceeding those experienced by fighter pilots. Or the sight of twin vapour trails spiralling off the rear wing of one of the mighty supercars as its driver cuts through the air on maximum turbo boost, going for pole position.  In this review you can experience all these images from the comfort of your armchair. And what a season to watch!  A brilliant and determined Briton, Nigel Mansell, has a season-long battle, not only against the hard-charging Brazilian Ayrton Senna in the Lotus, but also Keke ‘ten-tenths’ Rosberg and the reigning world champion Alain Prost, and his team mate Nelson Piquet.  All 16 races are featured in this two-hour programme accompanied by the sharp narration and wit Clive James.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jxW4xqBVTh9S9pXpFqlQcJhtVXz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1986","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":985,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxW4xqBVTh9S9pXpFqlQcJhtVXz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
