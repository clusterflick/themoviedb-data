In this film, Robert is an eccentric, oversized young man who puzzles and infuriates his parents by locking himself into a closet for long periods of time; at the same time, he loudly recites poetry by Arthur Rimbaud. Kicked out of the house by his exasperated parents, he decides to make a pilgrimage of the exotic African sites Rimbaud haunted in his final years. He meets and then travels with Isabelle, who is attempting to escape from a rejected suitor's unwanted attentions. In addition to that problem, she has another, more curious problem. It seems she is turning into a hawthorn bush.","popularity":0.2599,"poster_path":"/xzeoB1bPnMytEXZ9aTiW2ZVu3Ma.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainbow pour Rimbaud","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Marsac","original_name":"Laure Marsac","popularity":0.3156,"profile_path":"/sCz2f69Q2ummSuKDOD6XURsfiG1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62773b8c389da10050882e81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernadette Lafont","original_name":"Bernadette Lafont","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/eN4yXWW69DE0XpfKG09pziQclJ4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62773b98f90b19006bb5891d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3540873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Mac Leod","original_name":"Robert Mac Leod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62773ba2f90b1900a623b1ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Galabru","original_name":"Michel Galabru","popularity":0.3315,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62773ba93af929009bd3c276","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549321,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Teulé","original_name":"Jean Teulé","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/ukfKpluomJdZXNoMIqddXLMepMO.jpg","credit_id":"5c273ceb0e0a26793034b7ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0117434","wikidata_id":"Q22000532","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xzeoB1bPnMytEXZ9aTiW2ZVu3Ma.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
