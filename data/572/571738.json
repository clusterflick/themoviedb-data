The themes are endless and power-packed: Hear about Lauda’s retirement, Nigel Mansell’s first race wins, the emergence of new talents like Senna, the disappointment of mechanical failures, turbo teething problems, and what it’s like to race on some of the most famous circuits in the world - all from the horse’s mouth, so to speak.  The review of the 1985 season has all the main action from every round and the inside story on all the major players, all complemented by their own telling insights on the season as it unfolds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nqF9Gj9VEwEeZ9j9a652pWIZgME.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1985","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqF9Gj9VEwEeZ9j9a652pWIZgME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
