Patrick is a gay man whose circle of acquaintances provides the background for this story. They include Lou Rockfeller III, a flamboyant drag queen; Bruno (Bruno Anthony de Trigance), a former college professor who has since found success in the film industry; Daisy, a middle-aged author whose love life is a long litany of disasters; and Julien, a good-looking man who makes his living as a hustler. Julien was involved with Patrick at one time, and it turns out most of Patrick's friends have been with either him or Julien at one time or another -- which becomes a subject of grave concern when Julien develops a full-blown case of AIDS.","popularity":0.0669,"poster_path":"/5eZ4Fn9XHduAfUrBNjlSlHkT3r7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
