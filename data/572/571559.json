Stammer School features Musharaf Asghar – affectionately known as Mushy – from Educating Yorkshire. He found a place in the hearts of the nation as millions tuned in to watch him learn methods to overcome his crippling stammer and achieve the C grade he needed in his English GCSE. Although Mushy’s stammer has improved, he is often left speechless still. With the help of an intensive programme, led by other stutterers, Stammer School will follow Mushy and others as they attempt to overcome this huge stumbling block in their lives.","popularity":0.5387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":61485,"logo_path":"/zmJQMYKn6VdC1YUxK76u54TImIP.png","name":"Twofour","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
