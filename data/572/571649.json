In a tiny sailing boat, the Dutchman set sail across the ocean. Nine months later the boat was found adrift at sea. There was no sign of Ader. Itâ€™s a story that has always fascinated filmmaker Martijn Blekendaal, not just because of the disappearance itself, but also because of the entire mystery that surrounds it. Blekendaal embarks on an investigation that follows his footsteps to Hollywood. It turns out that, in order to understand what drove this man to his fateful voyage, the filmmaker has to overcome his fear of looking beyond his own horizon. In a whirlwind montage of images jumping from one time, place and person to another, Blekendaal shows us that Bas Jan left behind something more special than just a mystery.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/6F5meZt0Ka5TYFGADbbjQA81M0e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Looked Beyond the Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bas Jan Ader","original_name":"Bas Jan Ader","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/3q4rrelaequGRXUxfAwQXgO5mQm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e8702b1af58cb0010e29c1e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1894899,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pim Hawinkels","original_name":"Pim Hawinkels","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yc2LEi4lmPSsqPI0RpzdBFI3qQP.jpg","credit_id":"5c28c908c3a3684a15d111db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2204534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martijn Blekendaal","original_name":"Martijn Blekendaal","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/79L0ZXp9Cx56jn1CXBHeYJwddcs.jpg","credit_id":"5c28c86192514138e1c0809f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Finbarr Wilbrink","original_name":"Finbarr Wilbrink","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c28c9170e0a26791836e870","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benny Jansen","original_name":"Benny Jansen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c28c98cc3a3684a15d11226","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willemijn Cerutti","original_name":"Willemijn Cerutti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c28c8f9c3a36808dfd3167b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6F5meZt0Ka5TYFGADbbjQA81M0e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Dutch\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"nl\", \"native_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
