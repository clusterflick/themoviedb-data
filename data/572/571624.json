In one a roving camera focuses on red flowers in a field of lush vegetation. The spellbinding lull this imagery creates harmonizes with the projection to its left, which features a woman in sparkling ruby slippers promenading down a car-lined street. The fluidity of both scenes is disrupted when the woman violently smashes a row of car windshields with the long-stemmed flower she carries. As the vandal gains momentum with each gleeful strike of her wand, an approaching police officer smiles in approval, introducing comic tension into this whimsical and anarchistic scene. â€“MoMA","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/j0G6CZ4OQZE0ISz7OsDnBB2FqUy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ever Is Over All","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pipilotti Rist","original_name":"Pipilotti Rist","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/4HWQlRBBel6h3fURlYTaFIIrysP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c28a64692514138dfc06787","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pipilotti Rist","original_name":"Pipilotti Rist","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/4HWQlRBBel6h3fURlYTaFIIrysP.jpg","credit_id":"5c28a6880e0a26790d36a769","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pipilotti Rist","original_name":"Pipilotti Rist","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/4HWQlRBBel6h3fURlYTaFIIrysP.jpg","credit_id":"5c28a65392514138e5c03ea8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vAdb70ygFf6QgdhJQ6TT8V98w4Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j0G6CZ4OQZE0ISz7OsDnBB2FqUy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/GI2euYLkNfiBUKxyG8wwHkhCDw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pipilotti Rist: Ever Is Over All (1997)","key":"-gd06ukX-rU","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","published_at":"2014-05-13T03:17:42.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c28a766c3a3683a57d3d8eb"}]}}}
