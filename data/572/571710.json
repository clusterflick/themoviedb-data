Fortunately, he has his uncle and a circle of good friends to help him get settled in before his girlfriend arrives from England. This bittersweet French slice-of-life film follows their struggle to get the job done in time. The friends include two outspoken women, the clumsy younger brother of his friend, a good-humored bank clerk, and a reserved young man who works at a local mortuary.
