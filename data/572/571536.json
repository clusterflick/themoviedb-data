The film is built on conversations between me (the director) and God (my psychotic mum), whose face we never see in the film. We talk about her worlds; We encounter her flower language, we meet the devil’s birds and we learn how to marry the wind. The film turns into a declaration of love - to the crooked mind as well as to my mother.\" - Maria Bäck","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oQAKhGYUHoU1veSCZC6osRpxNWh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother is God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1574859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Bäck","original_name":"Maria Bäck","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/eXS4ixCM3FHG3iyyuhk8yZJkOXa.jpg","credit_id":"5c27d2310e0a267918359f94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oQAKhGYUHoU1veSCZC6osRpxNWh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
