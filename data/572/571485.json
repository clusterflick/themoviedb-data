They are helped economically by Pierpaolo, Luca’s seventeen-year-old son from a previous relationship. Pierpaolo lives in an Art Nouveau house with his mother and grandfather, an important trial lawyer of cases linked to politics who rakes in several million euros a year. In the setting of a magnificent and incomprehensible Rome, both a good mother and a bad one, Mary Ann, a deeply Catholic student of art history from Ireland, au pair for the little Lucilla, is caught in the middle.","popularity":0.5332,"poster_path":"/aWqrMRiA4bez1qfLtB5rewB9rfi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19916,"logo_path":"/dOQ7UtUAqydn5zmx3qElFIMqn6t.png","name":"Lotus Production","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":118025,"logo_path":"/47UYD8fQHJ4ueenwibNNWGKIR4j.png","name":"3 Marys Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivere","video":false,"vote_average":5.532,"vote_count":62,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Živeti","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"To Live","type":"Literal title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micaela Ramazzotti","original_name":"Micaela Ramazzotti","popularity":0.5206,"profile_path":"/6b3BGvkMFU5A2e4cqp6GmFzZkSL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Susi","credit_id":"5c2798540e0a26790d3539aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriano Giannini","original_name":"Adriano Giannini","popularity":0.7759,"profile_path":"/kJiwMKAFUgHreid1ES0xrG8r5H0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Luca","credit_id":"5c27986bc3a3683a59d262a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Ghini","original_name":"Massimo Ghini","popularity":0.2112,"profile_path":"/iSpdphEZopzvu3816YsiFhhKwRb.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Marinoni","credit_id":"5c2798720e0a26541c347342","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcello Fonte","original_name":"Marcello Fonte","popularity":0.1294,"profile_path":"/ebh2JpmwGghbFC55nsHpxY6R2QL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Perind","credit_id":"5c27985b92514138dabee446","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róisín O'Donovan","original_name":"Róisín O'Donovan","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/es4bpsCKv4v9NB2MPjRbnMKzsh6.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mary Ann","credit_id":"5c2798810e0a267933354acd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":124681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Calligari","original_name":"Andrea Calligari","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/yHbpOs3Ihq4fDptwbq9O5J4HjP2.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Pierpaolo","credit_id":"5c279888c3a3683a66d26854","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2386002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Miccoli","original_name":"Elisa Miccoli","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Lucilla","credit_id":"5d5264fb9a8a8a0015e46bf9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Cervi","original_name":"Valentina Cervi","popularity":0.4367,"profile_path":"/bDm4gL9FkfsaXJarQB71QH05cyb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Azzurra","credit_id":"5c279864c3a3683a66d26815","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Montesano","original_name":"Enrico Montesano","popularity":0.2696,"profile_path":"/myepIiCMGEwjhvZ3akFgVRogBP7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Avv.
