The last year of turbo engines was suitably thrilling, albeit almost completely dominated by the McLaren team mates Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. They may have been driving for the same team but the two biggest stars of the 1980s were, unsurprisingly, extremely motivated.  Neither gave an inch to the other on track, leading to several clashes, and sowing the seeds for future rivalry.  What the drivers said, how the teams worked, who held the joker at Monza and how the teams travelled the World; all these fascinating questions are answered when Stirling Moss and Tony Jardine give you your pass to the pitlane.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ljsKbFY3RRkDbW5bAFWJicJsvBJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1988","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":994,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ljsKbFY3RRkDbW5bAFWJicJsvBJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
