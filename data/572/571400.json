The composition included both stationary and moving trees (a wooded landscape). The relationship of this landscape to the vertical and horizontal plane was maintained as much as possible. The camera ran continuously until all the film was exposed. The world is seen from the point of view of a tree as its branches sway to the rhythm of the wind.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Welsby","original_name":"Chris Welsby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wVOcPAagP2yxdikKf33OaQs5Lmf.jpg","credit_id":"63bd8f1d5be00e0084634c79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
