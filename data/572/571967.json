Originally, this film was not in black and white, but in absolute black and full light. Indeed, initially, the screenings were only made with originals in which absolute black was achieved through the use of a totally opaque tape, while absolute white was generated by computer perforation (thus allowing all the light to pass through without the slightest opacity of film material).\r This film is not the transcription of a movement, but a succession of constructed composite facts which the projection device translates for the eye into impression of movements. It does not refer to any external reality, but is meant to be its own reality.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/xKW8xv9EIyKDAoJkB3WFQYDWm5Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black and Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2205564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Rovere","original_name":"Pierre Rovere","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2abe24c3a3682919a04c4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKW8xv9EIyKDAoJkB3WFQYDWm5Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
