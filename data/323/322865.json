David is the youngest of ten siblings in a close-knit Moroccan-Israeli family. While other nine have all extended the family tree by marrying and having children, David, at twenty-nine, still hasn't brought home a girlfriend, which inspires his family's constant nagging. The confessional film follows David as he takes small steps, gathering courage, and hoping to receive acceptance from his family.","popularity":0.1108,"poster_path":"/gsqHuAofZnTcsDSOcdAjHCQG2Lf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Say Amen","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Deri","original_name":"David Deri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/59HzapYUFgJtxh1eNT518Vall98.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"622e5949cdbaff007852369f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569874,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ruth Lev Ari","original_name":"Ruth Lev Ari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e59f84e4dff00791b95ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","original_name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e5a08cddbbc004736dd88","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Deri","original_name":"David Deri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/59HzapYUFgJtxh1eNT518Vall98.jpg","credit_id":"622e59e1006eee0074ba4715","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963153,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eyal Tsarfati","original_name":"Eyal Tsarfati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e5a16aad9c2001b50c3be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Deri","original_name":"David Deri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/59HzapYUFgJtxh1eNT518Vall98.jpg","credit_id":"54cea75bc3a3687f820065c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0478510","wikidata_id":"Q7428906","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gsqHuAofZnTcsDSOcdAjHCQG2Lf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
