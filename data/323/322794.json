The sound of sleigh-bells is heard, and the Count is brought in mortally wounded. Doctors and a priest are summoned, and the servants are questioned. It is proposed that Count Loris Ipanov, a suspected Nihilist sympathiser, was probably the assassin. De Siriex (a diplomat), and Grech (a police inspector) plan an investigation. Fedora swears on the jewelled Byzantine cross she is wearing that Count Andrejevich's death will be avenged.","popularity":0.3647,"poster_path":"/vrIkfUkiMJSJqTuUxFjz9jfp9O4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Domingo, what else but perfect!","title":"Fedora","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirella Freni","original_name":"Mirella Freni","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/gJZMLaFza1HUh5onrOu1TI0S0Mx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Fedora Romazov","credit_id":"54ce33cf9251414749005540","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plácido Domingo","original_name":"Plácido Domingo","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/r0OUJ630b7dllOFBQ4SElP3XnpC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Loris Ipanov","credit_id":"56a55ca7c3a368388e008292","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwayne Croft","original_name":"Dwayne Croft","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/qotUOcABW2A37LmK4VehrVlBESf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"De Siriex","credit_id":"574e55209251415f04000015","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ainhoa Arteta","original_name":"Ainhoa Arteta","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/hSJx4bJlMihY7VHfaMpxrP6HbLo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Olga Sukarev","credit_id":"574e5552c3a368116a000dd6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yannis Yannissis","original_name":"Yannis Yannissis","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Cirillo","credit_id":"574e557092514128e3000b7d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Hartman","original_name":"Vernon Hartman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Lorek","credit_id":"574e558c92514113ba000e45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Courtney","original_name":"James Courtney","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/olNxjayI7iK6OCGu7eRj46klwvr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Borov","credit_id":"574e55a892514113cc000e94","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen West","original_name":"Stephen West","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Grech","credit_id":"574e55c69251415f04000059","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Anthony","original_name":"Charles Anthony","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Desire","credit_id":"574e55ec92514113ba000e65","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Yves Thibaudet","original_name":"Jean-Yves Thibaudet","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/7BxFNEEnyGYFil9nLJpjhZlz7yN.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Boleslao Lazinski, a pianist","credit_id":"574e560cc3a3687ff3000e22","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421776,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roberto Abbado","original_name":"Roberto Abbado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Self -
