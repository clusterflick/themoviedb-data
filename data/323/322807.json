Rescuing Polly Loomis from the unwanted attentions of a saloon ruffian, he learns her mother married ranch foreman Nick Grindel shortly before her death, and left everything to him in her will. Nick has proposed marriage to his stepdaughter, and she fears violence if her hot-blooded brother Dick finds out. When a body is found at the Bow Knot, Tim barely rescues Dick from a necktie party and is deputized to investigate when Dick confesses to a crime he didn't commit.","popularity":0.6545,"poster_path":"/eGOU5MWAAQ3CdXxKlDsP00dpQuI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Western Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim McCoy","original_name":"Tim McCoy","popularity":0.4692,"profile_path":"/d176BmvSvxIkFSgpFSunE2nLQGO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tim Barrett","credit_id":"54ce41b0c3a3687f8200570d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Lane","original_name":"Nora Lane","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/AW4egmMYg6E0pBEZnMNw82InCR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Polly Loomis","credit_id":"54ce41b8c3a3681c9c003057","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mischa Auer","original_name":"Mischa Auer","popularity":0.2779,"profile_path":"/7mCfBcUq6FedSlD9lT6AWR3bIou.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chapman","credit_id":"5852e47fc3a3682fb802c1f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwight Frye","original_name":"Dwight Frye","popularity":0.3829,"profile_path":"/7tTCehS5FN9YuRKSWmlL5rygabD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dick Loomis","credit_id":"5852e48cc3a368258c01b973","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wheeler Oakman","original_name":"Wheeler Oakman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/4F4BCjUnk4h8P2QLRaKhE46OJSC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nick Grindell","credit_id":"5852e499c3a368315002381d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Betz","original_name":"Matthew Betz","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":"/tpGMjJrquUADwkV8ZXJLofwNy8d.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Warden","credit_id":"5852e4a7925141483a011a9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon De Main","original_name":"Gordon De Main","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/99B8IX2Evs7QJCueWHkVweJQCgz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Fred Purdy","credit_id":"5852e4b5c3a368315002382f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Fernández","original_name":"Emilio Fernández","popularity":0.6379,"profile_path":"/hCVwwh6e5gCZQumxkS9HlZhMT1h.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Indian Joe","credit_id":"5852e4c492514175ad01a679","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John P.
