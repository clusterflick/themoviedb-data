Lesbians and step-sisters, the gender-bending artists lived and worked together all their lives. Heroic resisters to the Nazis occupying Jersey Isle during WWII, they were captured and sentenced to death. Award-winning filmmaker Barbara Hammer infuses this film with vigor using photographs, archival footage, dramatic interludes of a “found Cahun script”, and unique interviews of Jersey Isle residents who knew the “sisters”.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/1E81xEgsvoOBlpEgyStZqkt3DzQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lover Other","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"60d65d6aef9d72002faeb941","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"60d65db48805510074c5be3a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"60d65d9e99c96400750cdb49","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"60d65d5aaa7898005d5026e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"54cd6df8925141475b002721","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0816207","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1E81xEgsvoOBlpEgyStZqkt3DzQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1778},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1421,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wgbTpW4PRQ9IW4JT3Pbs5aXgvDw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":997},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yizpSOmsL28Jw4U4g6hZKzdALo5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (Frameline)","release_date":"2006-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
