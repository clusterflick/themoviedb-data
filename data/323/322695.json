Boy I Am is a feature-length documentary that begins to break down that barrier and promote dialogue about trans issues through a look at the experiences of three young transitioning FTMs in New York City--Nicco, Norie and Keegan--as they go through major junctures in their transitions, as well as through the voices of lesbians, activists and theorists who raise and address the questions that many people have but few openly discuss.","popularity":0.1777,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy I Am","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Feder","original_name":"Sam Feder","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cd65bd925141474b0024e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Hollar","original_name":"Julie Hollar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cd65cec3a3687f8f00257a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1024954","wikidata_id":"Q116978282","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
