She goes out, and the cat goes after the canary. Doggie hears the racket and takes in the situation. Knowing he is no match for Tabbie he runs as fast as his little legs will carry him to a kennel where he tells his troubles to three big collies, who run back with him. They secure entrance to the house through a basement window, and arrive in time to save the bird's life. Tabby runs away, and an exciting chase follows. When Mabel comes home and sees the overturned bird cage and the canary's tall feathers palled out she thinks her little doggie has chased the cat away, and hugs her hero.","popularity":0.483,"poster_path":"/4Mxm6rbJ65ufqkcgH7bqPLtZA2g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Hero","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Clever Dog","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Brainy Dog","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"De Schrandere Hond","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54c9c82f92514108c7004f9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5025750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pepper the Cat","original_name":"Pepper the Cat","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"671e618f769107d77b481bef","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"6305d46fb7d352007bc853d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nichols","original_name":"George Nichols","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/ghGlmpjdUDRShrGZyG92sm3m5Hx.jpg","credit_id":"6305d46472a2c9009e4fef3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003073","wikidata_id":"Q3602549","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Mxm6rbJ65ufqkcgH7bqPLtZA2g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Little Hero (1913)","key":"jnQLFMJSl4E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-01-24T13:05:51.000Z","id":"66c7ee353b4229be80f2aebc"}]}}}
