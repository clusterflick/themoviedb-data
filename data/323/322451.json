The highly abstracted, colored digital video (shot on video and Super-8) evokes a psychedelic experience. As Sogo recalls: \"It was 5:45 AM; [I was] crashing at a friend's house, deep in Brooklyn, where I was dealing with a final point in the movie. Then, I crashed with a seizure, all my memories flashed before me. I fell off the stairs, and the film finished itself.\"","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/51cTJduPuc53oXhGFVvMHHMvDXR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guided by Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stom Sogo","original_name":"Stom Sogo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/onlZje1ofVe66Osp2UhwvlRU0h7.jpg","credit_id":"54cb5f13c3a368044800ecf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/51cTJduPuc53oXhGFVvMHHMvDXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Whitney Biennial","release_date":"2000-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
