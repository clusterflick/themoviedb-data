Filmmakers Trevor Greenwood, Robert Dickson and Alan Gorg were UCLA film students when they crafted a documentary from the perspective of the unassuming-yet-articulate teenager Felicia Bragg, a high-school student of African-American and Hispanic descent. Felicia’s first-person narrative reflects her hopes and frustrations as she annotates footage of her family, school and neighborhood, creating a time capsule that’s both historically and culturally significant. Its provenance as an educational film continues today as university courses use \"Felicia\" to teach documentary filmmaking techniques and cite it as an example of how non-traditional sources, as well as mainstream television news, reflect and influence public opinion.","popularity":0.0677,"poster_path":"/j1g0Znd7vq1EhIcjM3uF2TtMtvB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Felicia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felicia Bragg","original_name":"Felicia Bragg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"58c7502992514179e4004368","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Greenwood","original_name":"Trevor Greenwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57348b9cc3a3681e6e001e27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Dickson","original_name":"Bob Dickson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57348b89c3a36875b20004a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Gorg","original_name":"Alan Gorg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57348b939251417540001cd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618828,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Roe","original_name":"Stuart Roe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57349d879251417515001f53","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4289014","wikidata_id":"Q28457925","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1g0Znd7vq1EhIcjM3uF2TtMtvB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
