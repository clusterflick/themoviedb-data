Entering the daily lives of \"problem cases\" at a Montreal secondary school that sits at the bottom of the school performance rankings, Denys Desjardins sweeps away preconceptions about the quality of teaching in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and the alleged delinquency of the kids who live there. A far-reaching examination of student life that stimulates reflection on the role of school in our society and asks how willing we are to support and finance the school system so that it will not be merely a factory churning out parts for the social machine.","popularity":0.0778,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Human","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denys Desjardins","original_name":"Denys Desjardins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cea2c5c3a3687f820064e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421899,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yves Bisaillon","original_name":"Yves Bisaillon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cea2dc9251415fb3004e1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421900,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elric Robichon","original_name":"Elric Robichon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cea358925141474b0065fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sandro Forte","original_name":"Sandro Forte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cea3719251414755006668","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421902,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Bellefleur","original_name":"Simon Bellefleur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cea3839251414757006514","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1024984","wikidata_id":"Q3136644","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
