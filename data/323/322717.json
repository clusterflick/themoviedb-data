Was he a traitor, or the savior of Poland? The Polish documentary filmmaker Dariusz Jablonski begins his story of the colonel in 2004, when he was supposed to interview him for the very first time. It turns out that Kuklinski has just died, and at the request of the colonel's wheelchair-bound wife, Jablonski agrees to take care of his ashes. He talks with a considerable number of closely involved ex-servicemen -- from the U.S. head of espionage General William E. Odom to the Warsaw Pact Commander-in-Chief Viktor Kulikov, the Polish General Wojciech Jaruzelski, and former Polish President Lech Walesa.","popularity":0.1843,"poster_path":"/1LRnXQuudjBG8Il0QycZ1N0n8wj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77082,"logo_path":"/oh7sgn2BegfM0hHe1YYFHAZIE4k.png","name":"Trigon Production","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":11240,"logo_path":"/i59ItaKFdxJ7Yi6w2s7CML0LBvI.png","name":"Polish Film Institute","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2009-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Games and the Man Who Stopped Them","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bartłomiej Woźniak","original_name":"Bartłomiej Woźniak","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65358402abdafc010c299b5c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1752623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Violetta Kamińska","original_name":"Violetta Kamińska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653584538cfcc7012b401b05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dariusz Jabłoński","original_name":"Dariusz Jabłoński","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/wYoWHWjWbA0OziYPEIqIkOhsIkn.jpg","credit_id":"65358419abdafc014e7dd8c6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179781,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milenia Fiedler","original_name":"Milenia Fiedler","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/jzHHLY3pCz1fDumWfQoKCrutHPv.jpg","credit_id":"653583dbc8a5ac0139ab1ae8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dariusz Jabłoński","original_name":"Dariusz Jabłoński","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/wYoWHWjWbA0OziYPEIqIkOhsIkn.jpg","credit_id":"65358431c8a5ac00ac394e76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dariusz Jabłoński","original_name":"Dariusz Jabłoński","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/wYoWHWjWbA0OziYPEIqIkOhsIkn.jpg","credit_id":"6535836ac14fee0100e9a93f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1752622,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izabela Wójcik","original_name":"Izabela Wójcik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6535843e2b210800e23cd610","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610570,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bartosz Pietras","original_name":"Bartosz Pietras","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653583e88cfcc700c83e1b61","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610050,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Radosław Rekita","original_name":"Radosław Rekita","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f6c295de21a6b78250ca85","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6422,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michał Lorenc","original_name":"Michał Lorenc","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":"/5WyrWWqf7XnoDwF46Mjo2Fh4D64.jpg","credit_id":"66f6c2a16c9a68155070d827","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2663101,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mateusz Wajda","original_name":"Mateusz Wajda","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67389d76119917bc1f5e6fce","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1778231,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomasz Michałowski","original_name":"Tomasz Michałowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6jE6aphSnY3gpgD58zFHrjsNVvt.jpg","credit_id":"67389d81ff0e18373ceec001","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1415201","wikidata_id":"Q9281602","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1LRnXQuudjBG8Il0QycZ1N0n8wj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
