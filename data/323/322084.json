Young recruits engage in simulated combat training, which barely differs from video games produced as entertainment. Footage is included from a workshop demonstrating the use of computer re-enactments in the psychological care of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. As a large-scale installation, Serious Games critically focuses on the role of audiovisual culture in the spectacle of war.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/mVzuRkmLB5PtaE4XRUTQHTq33Ld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serious Games 1–4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Kratisch","original_name":"Ingo Kratisch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a3366705b5492f9ef6c791","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"54c9d8ac925141679400a0f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tH6xzNuJwtvOQFrJENiZms3AQP6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1899},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/adKCBREz8GpcYHyCtZ86XVsZfJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/mVzuRkmLB5PtaE4XRUTQHTq33Ld.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/yR2o0Ju0sN1ZYyqDgA7JcENuEbF.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/AjAiqPIOD2xFTr6aPoKKx68VJt0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ojp8sKqsGemIHZ3b2tmNao0uoid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
