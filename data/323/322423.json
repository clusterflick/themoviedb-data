ARBOR suggests the fragility and ephemerality of memory and its artifacts through subtle manipulations of the photographs: reframings, layerings, inversions, and the introduction of natural elements, including flowers and leaves. The photographs’ subjects rarely engage the camera; they are glimpsed, rather than seen. They look elsewhere, and wait for something inevitable.  Gathering on a hillside, lounging on the grass beyond now-lost trees, the inhabitants of ARBOR cycle through their one elusive afternoon, gradually succumbing to time or dissolving into landscape, reserving for themselves what we can’t know---and becoming shadows in their own stories.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hBW6YLtjspOhLMPu55P8tSK5q6T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arbor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janie Geiser","original_name":"Janie Geiser","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/1rgqjWeJNfuOqCTWax9hg2VMQXD.jpg","credit_id":"54cb1eff92514157cc00eb2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hBW6YLtjspOhLMPu55P8tSK5q6T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
