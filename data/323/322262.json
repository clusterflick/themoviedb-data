Subjectified lets women speak for themselves. While our culture is saturated with images of female sexuality, the real voices of women themselves are frequently missing. Through in-depth interviews, Subjectified lets women do the talking, trading easy answers and stereotypes for brutal honesty. The stories may sound familiar: young moms, abstinent Christians, lesbians, survivors of assaults and STDs. But outside the world of reality TV and sound bites, women approach their lives in complex and unexpected ways: sometimes hilarious, sometimes sobering, and always heartfelt. Subjectified will change the way you think about women's sexuality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subjectified: Nine Young Women Talk about Sex","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Tapper Goldman","original_name":"Melissa Tapper Goldman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63723f6421621b00777e6107","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785588,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christy Ann Spindler","original_name":"Christy Ann Spindler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63723f7aca4f6700bbc07c56","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Tapper Goldman","original_name":"Melissa Tapper Goldman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63723fd221621b00777e6160","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341791","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
