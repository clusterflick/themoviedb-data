While thousands submitted to the foreign rule, Non-gae encourages General CHOI Kyung-hoe to love her, so that she can behead him. In 2007 Korea lovers Seung-hyun and Young-shin are also botanists in search of a legendary flower believed to absorb human souls. During their mountain trek, they encounter Jae-jin a stranger who insists he knows them both. Jae-jin’s presence has a strange effect on Seung-hyun, whose bursts of insanity eventually threaten Young-shin’s life. Eventually Seung-hyun finds himself in a struggle to death with Jae-jin. The film is a fantasy motivated by a historical story of Nongae and the idea of Buddhist transmigration of souls.(KOFIC)","popularity":0.4814,"poster_path":"/wlkA5dqKcA89cxOsLT0jC6MK0PI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2007-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resurrection of the Butterfly","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Geurimja","type":"revised romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Mu-saeng","original_name":"이무생","popularity":0.6138,"profile_path":"/xokzuuLDfVzassk0bmje2fvdMcM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c2ce4e792514122a66e92c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeon Bo-yeong","original_name":"Jeon Bo-yeong","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54cbdb21925141678c0153c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myeong Seung-hun","original_name":"Myeong Seung-hun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54cbdb26c3a3680924010836","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Hee-jun","original_name":"이희준","popularity":0.8791,"profile_path":"/4slyXnHbKgzmeyJNetBSORgDDEF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b21fc500e0a264d9f0158d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3399975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeong In-ji","original_name":"정인지","popularity":0.2729,"profile_path":"/vIUgDWfhS0JHubxluT7v98O53xg.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Ghost","credit_id":"6217564c3a99370042e506ca","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1149988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kim Min-Sook","original_name":"Kim Min-Sook","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cbdb3fc3a36874ac014d6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420763,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kang Hyeon-seong","original_name":"Kang Hyeon-seong","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54cbdb53925141678e01512e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1700641,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kang Mi-ja","original_name":"강미자","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5812c6e1c3a3687a8d01e07d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":63434,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Kwon Yoo-jin","original_name":"권유진","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d15f90b18b7516c9a5da359","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Jung-gook","original_name":"이정국","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc85b187d2bc15798347aea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2420144","wikidata_id":"Q21057665","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDhydAfTbLp32wzepHMCJ8LbWQY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/wlkA5dqKcA89cxOsLT0jC6MK0PI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212573,"name":"japanese invasion of korea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
