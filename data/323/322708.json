One is my mother, Pauline Silvia, who was a Navy biologist in the early 1950's and was sent to the Nevada Test Site where she witnessed five detonations. After decades of silence, she is in a crisis of conscience about the work she did. The other woman is Emiko Okada, a Hiroshima survivor who was eight years old when the bomb was dropped. Knowing the work that Pauline did, Emiko offers her an olive branch with a beautifully potent message of peace.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atomic Mom","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Lukk","original_name":"Howard Lukk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voice-Over","credit_id":"551f4e7e9251417be2000226","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.T.
