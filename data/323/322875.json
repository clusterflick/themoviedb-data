From the plains of in Mongolia to a hotel room in Beijing and back. A beautiful fiction debut by the maker of the award-winning The Land. Time and the impossibility of reconstructing the past form the themes that bring together the three stories in Erdos Rider - just as previously in Wang Haolin’s 2009 film The Land (at that time the director used the name He Jia).

Or maybe there is no truth in the world.  © iffr.com","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing YuanQi Cultural Development Co.,LTD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2014-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erdos Rider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"He Yufan","original_name":"He Yufan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceaf629251415cb80051c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gandige","original_name":"Gandige","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceaf80925141475b00672a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gandige","original_name":"Gandige","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceaf8492514147570066dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gandige","original_name":"Gandige","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceaf86925141474b0067de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gandige","original_name":"Gandige","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceaf8c9251414749006671","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mata","original_name":"Mata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceaf95c3a3687f88006bfe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candige","original_name":"Candige","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54ceafa0c3a3687f9200611d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candige","original_name":"Candige","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"-","credit_id":"54ceafa4c3a3687f820066d2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Haolin","original_name":"Wang Haolin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ceaf41925141475500683c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
