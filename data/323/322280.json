The footage was captured at iconic concert venue Dan’s Silverleaf in Midlake’s hometown of Denton, TX, where the band had stopped off to play a local show while on tour promoting their fourth album Antiphon which was released November 5, 2013. The result is a beautifully photographed 90 minute film that is both a live concert film and documentary homage to the band’s hometown of Denton, TX. 2004 was also the year that Noren filmed “Way Out East!\", a video release for Lee’s Stereo Skateboard company featuring songs from Midlake's debut album Bamnan and Slivercork. Therefore the recent collaboration of Lee and Noren for Midlake: Live in Denton, TX has brought things full circle for the filmmakers and band, ten years later","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/sFIwnCMbmgHV3ONtKgbp9hSrDmP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midlake: Live in Denton, TX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFIwnCMbmgHV3ONtKgbp9hSrDmP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
