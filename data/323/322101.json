Mr van den Heuvel, a cobbler, lives with his wife and two small children in a one-room hovel in a dingy alley. He wants to work, but is usually too tired and is continuously coughing. He ignores the advice of his doctor to go to a health centre. His little daughter, Annetje, is not well either. At school she is listless, never wanting to play with her classmates. A visiting school doctor examines the girl and gives her a note for her parents, advising them to consult their doctor. Father considers this as nonsense.","popularity":0.0531,"poster_path":"/xR3oL7r07MKEy6nL14JWadH1pTm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Clouds the Sun Is Shining","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Behind the Clouds the Sun Is Shining","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.A. Huijsers","original_name":"B.A. Huijsers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Meneer Van den Heuvel","credit_id":"54c9f10b925141561e0069a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mevrouw Huijsers","original_name":"Mevrouw Huijsers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Zijn vrouw","credit_id":"54c9f11392514157cc006632","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mientje Mullens","original_name":"Mientje Mullens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Annetje","credit_id":"54c9f11b925141561e0069ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
