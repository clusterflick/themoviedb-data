From post-war Berlin to the New York art scene, from folk duos to disco comebacks, Billie Trix has done it all — often naked, usually high, and always on her own terms. Drawing on her warped memories, lost loves, and chaotic career, Billie delivers a savage, surreal monologue that collides memoir, stand-up, and cabaret. Blending monologue with original songs by The Pet Shop Boys, MUSIK is a genre- defying exploration of fame, failure, and fierce individuality — wrapped in sequins and spiked with satire. At once riotous and poignant, this cult show returns as a filmed stage event that cements Billie Trix’s place in the pantheon of outsider icons. As she says herself: \"I am music. Ich bin Musik. Without me, there is nothing.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fOKfqLo3FZLlBbZuMLfuMc34XgX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"MUSIK","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Barber","original_name":"Frances Barber","popularity":1.5874,"profile_path":"/j4vvOB1GPVDqFJYEp56v23CF0CW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6980e66f625ceefba8fd4b7a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOKfqLo3FZLlBbZuMLfuMc34XgX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
