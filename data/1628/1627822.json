This work seeks to unsettle that desire by having performers trained on videos of robots mimicking complicated and seemingly unique-to-human movements (e.g., dancing and unusual gaits) to then have them re- perform the robot routines. The resulting performances show humans not simply mimic but liberally interpret and reimagine the robots that complicate the concept of 'training' so often deployed in the world of Al and robotic development; and revealing the 'human' vis a vis the machine in the performers' slippages and misses than in faithful execution.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human Learning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5980994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giang Nguyen Hoang","original_name":"Giang Nguyen Hoang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980bc541cff7f746ab214e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
