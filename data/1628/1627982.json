The boy, spoiled by life, doesn't appreciate the legacy of his ancestors and doesn't understand the beauty of the harsh taiga. To pass on ancient knowledge to his grandson, his grandfather takes him into the dense forest. However, the journey turns into unexpected trials: Mishuk and his faithful dog, Sergekh, become lost in the forest. In despair, they encounter a magical deer—the guardian of the taiga—who grants the boy the amazing ability to understand the language of all living things. Together with his grandfather, he fights poachers to save the Spirit of the Taiga.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zZ57PV5hfXVFxAyFb4qvN6SiX9f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2026-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Мэхээлэчээн Булчут","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Мои таежные каникулы","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Mekheelecheen Bulchut","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Moi taezhnye kanikuly","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Moi tayozhnye kanikuly","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1996296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fedot Lvov","original_name":"Федот Львов","popularity":0.2793,"profile_path":"/1fYeGjDjjJ9VkFVC1c9QyHzuDg9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6981013b14f4718a56313f20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasily Borisov","original_name":"Василий Борисов","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/oBFItnTKkdWbMvYqqc3xfDWM72Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69810142ad110a105d382b62","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2185927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danil Osipov","original_name":"Данил Осипов","popularity":0.2346,"profile_path":"/uLJoTN7oTUcBQj0BpdaoU2Ca77g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69810148e07ab1976b705175","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5981673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damir Dyakonov","original_name":"Дамир Дьяконов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6981016fad110a105d382b72","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5981674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Algys Makarov","original_name":"Алгыс Макаров","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"698101750f4f04e33b4c924c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5981676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dulustan Mukhin","original_name":"Дьулустан Мухин","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6981018152711dbb4e4c92cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4196503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayaal Vinokurov","original_name":"Айаал Винокуров","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"698101869b8651cf08e916c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2179102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuliya Myarina","original_name":"Юлия Мярина","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/nfc7dCvEDwYFVfZNyfdZftOji82.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"698101930f4f04e33b4c925b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2590424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Lukin","original_name":"Александр Лукин","popularity":0.395,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698101eeb54883ca32313f31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5981683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yulia Burnasheva","original_name":"Юлия Бурнашева","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698101fb93ad53870e313ee1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5487407,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nadezhda Ilyina","original_name":"Надежда Ильина","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69810231a199978754e91733","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5981687,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nurguyaana Struchkova","original_name":"Ньургуйаана Стручкова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6981023d032eae1b93e060b9","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1987334,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Moisey Kobyakov","original_name":"Моисей Кобяков","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698102471c6fa316d8418e72","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zZ57PV5hfXVFxAyFb4qvN6SiX9f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spirit Of Fire International Festival Of Cinematographic Debuts","release_date":"2026-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
