Emerging 1,500 years ago out of the mud of a marshy lagoon, Venice has managed to rise above the sea’s challenges ever since. The city’s founders knew what they were doing: the water’s relentless threat is also the source of the city’s fortune and worldwide influence. But it takes constant vigilance. Over the centuries, Venice has had to invent and innovate, finding new technical solutions to keep the city vital, vibrant, and dry without sacrificing its soul.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20985,"logo_path":"/gNDZkHNine5zxjSsM9LhbCPrbFa.png","name":"Kwanza","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venice: Building Beauty from a Swamp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148996,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guilain Depardieu","original_name":"Guilain Depardieu","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/v3IAn5yE8Hwi5C0oOAEnBg7wEGy.jpg","credit_id":"697f9cc45adda73f8dbe565e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
