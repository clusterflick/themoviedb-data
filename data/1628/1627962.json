Most of these filming locations were chosen from lists of photogenic sites popular on Xiaohongshu (RedNotes), i.e. places that have become “internet-famous” through a single viral post, attracting waves of photographers and tourists. Yet the artist deliberately diverges from these original images, turning away from the sharply defined details and edges of these celebrated sites. Instead, the camera retreats into marginalized zones at the limits of visibility, areas suffused with blinding halos of light.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/f8vbcGqWuM6JTd4g2QFdJMoYgDs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Rib of the Greater Bay Area","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhou Tao","original_name":"Zhou Tao","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/7CaMqzTM19OYf3pIa4i9KBmzlUq.jpg","credit_id":"6980f73db823edaa3281bd32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/P56VwPeOWA5fS0hVl1vG2h4f8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8vbcGqWuM6JTd4g2QFdJMoYgDs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
