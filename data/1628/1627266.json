Adapted from a live piece of the same name, this dance film explores the intersection of time, desire, and connection as five individuals inhabit a room, bound by the act of waiting.  Immediately following the screening, Smith, Schraiber, and dancer Jeremy Coachman (LA Dance Project) will perform excerpts from two powerful works: an emotionally-charged solo from Seasons of Dance set to Max Richter’s reimagining of “Vivaldi, The New Four Seasons”, and a dynamic duet from The Cello Player which excavates the complexity of ancient relationships.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":141079,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Five bodies share a room, bound by the act of waiting — each for a different longing.
