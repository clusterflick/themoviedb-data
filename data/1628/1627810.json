Children of the Blitz tells the stories of those who remained at home, often to help their families, or because their parents couldn’t bear to send them away.  Through the eyes of survivors who were children at the time, the film will explore how The Blitz contributed towards our sense of national identity and how the ‘Blitz Spirit’ is still held up as a defining characteristic of Britishness today. The film will also examine the starker reality for children whose homes were destroyed, including those who lost parents, and some who were left to fend for themselves - many grew up with their stories unheard.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144640,"logo_path":"/dU4Bna2kbK5S6npO7N1Q5rpOwRn.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":35177,"logo_path":"/3QcZMjZRSqmaNkf0vFm49OhK6bA.png","name":"Minnow Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Blitz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Warrender","original_name":"Jack Warrender","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980ba3cac118111421ff34d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2169269,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Clare Sillery","original_name":"Clare Sillery","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980ba57a64d9861e3b98eb8","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4752889,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morgan Matthews","original_name":"Morgan Matthews","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980ba75a64d9861e3b98ebb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Jones","original_name":"Sophie Jones","popularity":0.3275,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980ba8f195ec16f19b98c81","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3808071,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Grafton","original_name":"George Grafton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980bab3dc162191ad8c3b09","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
