Rather than the raunchy 1984 comedy, this version focuses on how students who are dismissed as “nerds” navigate stereotypes, build confidence, and challenge unfair treatment in school settings. Designed for discussion in middle‑ and high‑school classrooms, the film encourages viewers to rethink assumptions, recognize the harm of casual bullying, and appreciate the strengths that come from being different. From the \"Learning To Be Human\" video series, based on the 1985 children's book by John McNamara.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ehUTW95wgdxpBoO67MaoLrpQxp0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Learning Corporation of America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revenge Of The Nerd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Jacobs","original_name":"Manny Jacobs","popularity":0.3001,"profile_path":"/ePXo3vs8JzWl6ALfDRnuGy6eRiQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"697fd667c322a497be8c35ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Barnes","original_name":"Christopher Barnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"697fd76aac79b87201b21078","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Inglis","original_name":"Sarah Inglis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"697fda235adda73f8dbe5858","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Weiler","original_name":"Robert Weiler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"697fda7a836f3248a8fd45ea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979542,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John McNamara","original_name":"John McNamara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697fd7baa6a869dea88c3751","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k9J9t9tHm58oPV3uP7LxqwHGwkl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9qNcuPUNFSR5mC4IosMRBgCSbk8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.051,"height":514,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3CZNqMx0jP83HYQxGyX04yD3C3t.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1054},{"aspect_ratio":1.624,"height":654,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lFpZqYxhPsgdNOGbxkJCNqSB6UM.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062},{"aspect_ratio":1.624,"height":654,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/id8E7uLMGJfMnjPaJGAiim3lHBQ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jshJ97x4rCTNxK3EfMfdTcAy0Lk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ehUTW95wgdxpBoO67MaoLrpQxp0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
