In 1977 California, 13-year-old Samantha is navigating adolescence and dreams of becoming an actress when she is drawn into the orbit of celebrated filmmaker Roman Polanski. What follows alters her life forever. As the case erupts across headlines, Samantha and her mother are thrust into a relentless media storm — she’s hounded by paparazzi and stripped of privacy at the moment where she most needs protection. Together, mother and daughter must fight to reclaim Samantha’s voice and preserve what remains of her childhood.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5381,"logo_path":"/m6vSpFeYtFoW1lNv5mpLHzH4eLL.png","name":"Backup
