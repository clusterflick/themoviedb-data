The war in the south of the country threatens to spill over at any moment, in a country plagued by an economic collapse. Her unemployed, alcoholic husband Mounir, an ex-Civil War militiaman, spends his time watching television. The couple’s feeling of unease fluctuates between aggression and guilt. One night, their twenty-three-year-old daughter Rania knocks over a man while driving home. Nayla is caught up in a vicious circle: She finds herself with Rania, in hospital, facing a family from “the other side.” Animosity and curiosity alternate. For the first time in a long while, Nayla does some deep soul-searching. Her relationship with her husband worsens. But the injured man's condition suddenly deteriorates and he dies. Rania is taken to prison.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":61215,"logo_path":"/oyxIHQffvMaJmvbZrULZv43bEym.png","name":"Orjouane Productions","origin_country":"LB"},{"id":124125,"logo_path":"/oUEfgXsAJqnbddGgX8OSTjUzGIO.png","name":"Djinn House Productions","origin_country":"LB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Grey Glow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Chouéri","original_name":"Christine Chouéri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"698003e6a6a869dea88c3a06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Yammine","original_name":"Gabriel Yammine","popularity":0.2038,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"698004663d94671bc9be59f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3680501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Younes","original_name":"Tracy Younes","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"698003f0de671e709bb98910","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ammar Chalak","original_name":"Ammar Chalak","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"698003f5c1a23eebf5b98932","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wafak Taraby","original_name":"Wafak Taraby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"698003fa266d303ed7fd4718","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4231716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salma Chalaby","original_name":"Salma Chalaby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6980040164c85273e41bd91f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198651,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michèle Tyan","original_name":"Michèle Tyan","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980041dd2467e9b8eb21055","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406476,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bassem Fayad","original_name":"Bassem Fayad","popularity":0.1737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69800425bfa4389cdc1fee0e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5979915,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Haber","original_name":"Simon Haber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6980042d1be4a786648c36f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290185,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cynthia Zaven","original_name":"Cynthia Zaven","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69800433729bda78568c36ee","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFs1IT8sPMgxkIAqv6AuM95SEee.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
