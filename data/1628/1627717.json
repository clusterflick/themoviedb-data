As the mountain crackles with wind and ice, we move between their present struggle for survival and memories of loved ones far below. Rob, the expedition leader, summits thirty minutes past the safe turnaround time while Doug collapses nearby. Beck, stranded lower on the mountain, drifts between consciousness and visions of his daughter in Texas. As a violent storm descends, the climbers face impossible odds, revealing the fragility of life, the endurance of love, and the power of human conviction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everest: Opera in the Planetarium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Staufenbiel","original_name":"Brian Staufenbiel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698099d9e858bcdd871ec2c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joby Talbot","original_name":"Joby Talbot","popularity":0.3472,"profile_path":"/gCMvTUXoN31VfKxFZ5UX13qBkgq.jpg","credit_id":"69809a00dc7e791beb8c3ba4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5980781,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gene Scheer","original_name":"Gene Scheer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69809a584249cbf781b98b59","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
