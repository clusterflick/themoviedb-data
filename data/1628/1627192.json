Some 60 years after the rolls were exposed to light, what they uncovered was beautifully grainy raw footage from material shot for Sleep, Kiss, Batman Dracula, and Couch, as well as five unseen Screen Test portraits featuring Factory regulars. As an added bonus, five film rolls shot by Factory cinematographer Danny Williams showcasing Gerard Malanga, Paul Morrissey, Edie Sedgwick, the Velvet Underground, and Andy Warhol will also be seen for the first time.
