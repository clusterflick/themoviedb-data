The women seem to be in charge; at any rate, they are allowed to do everything that only men were allowed to do in the past: they fight, they give orders, they play dangerous games. The men, on the other hand, spend hours in the bathroom, take the children to kindergarten, and otherwise keep a low profile.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poleshift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Altorjay","original_name":"Gábor Altorjay","popularity":0.2049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69808e7f42e9e9bbc3be5b69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
