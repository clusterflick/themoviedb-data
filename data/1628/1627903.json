Unparalleled in their ability to adapt to the changing cinematic landscape, Laurel and Hardy’s upwards trajectory was only bolstered by the arrival of sound. Their first sound short, appropriately titled Unaccustomed As We Are, begins to incorporate sync sound gags and was so well received by audiences that the duo would go on to win the Academy Award for The Music Box just a few years later, an impressively rare feat for the time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laurel & Hardy Year Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
