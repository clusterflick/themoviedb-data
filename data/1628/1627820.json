Answering only to Kasuga—one of the most powerful women in the Tokugawa court—this elite group, known as the Kagero Group, handled conspiracies and missions too dangerous or politically sensitive to be addressed openly.  When a plot to overthrow the ruling family of the Omura domain is uncovered, the Kagero Group is dispatched to intervene.  Led by Kagero (played by Hiromi Takigawa), granddaughter of the legendary ninja Hattori Hanzo, they join forces with the shadowy Yagyu clan to stop the conspiracy before it can bring down the domain from within.  In a world ruled by secrets and shadows, these women fight not only for justice—but for survival.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ninja Vixens: The Kagero Squad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
