As an eight-year-old girl, she shared the fate of thousands of Ghanaian children who were put to slave labour by their own parents. For years Barbara functioned in a world full of abuse, violence and fear but she survived. Although full of anger, she has been supporting her parents and pays for the family, but their expectations keep rising. One day, together with her eldest brother, Kweku, she returns to her hometown to solve some family problems. Before that can happen, Barbara has to finally confront her parents.","popularity":0.1209,"poster_path":"/b4ZOo9ADouLBV7ziE9FHvbhiIUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250,"logo_path":"/evWKasiElVQywuKv2dI72P9twz8.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":200782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pinot Films","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":122740,"logo_path":"/c0XQNpfyvFfyK9WxdADpl3wPYk5.png","name":"MX35","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":229688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundacja Filmowa im.
