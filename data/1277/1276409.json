Abba aficionados would say the best. Their quintessential Euro-Pop sound that made their name on single-packed albums, such as \"Voulez Vous\" and \"Super Trouper\", was finally put to one side in an album more thoughtful, autobiographical and sophisticated than anything that had come before. Drawing on rare footage of ABBA in performance this powerful and penetrating film features the impartial and forthright views of a leading team of critics and working musicians.  Featured Tracks Include: The Visitors, Head Over Heals, When All Is Said and Done, Soldiers, I Let the Music Speak, One of Us, Two For the Price Of One, Slipping Through My Fingers, Like an Angel Passing Through My Room","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock Milestones: ABBA - The Visitors","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
