The Westward expansion, the Dust Bowl era, hobos, post-war suburbanization and the Beat critique of it; hitchhiking, the upheavals of the 1960s and early 1970s and the current generation of backpackers clutching their Lonely Planet and Rough Guides. American Road ultimately probes the meaning of what it is to be an American, not just a wayfarer.â€”anonymous","popularity":0.4711,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":226478,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cold Chicago
