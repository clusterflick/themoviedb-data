Raised on the island, Anastasia witnessed the shortcomings of its education system, exacerbated by restructuring in 2011. Despite its proximity to the mainland, the island remains isolated, impacting young perspectives. With below-average results, school closures, and underfunding prevalent, Anastasia's documentary aims to spark discussion and drive positive change. Returning as a recent graduate, she interviews locals to understand the issues and propose solutions. \"Cut Adrift\" is a poignant call to action, urging for improved educational opportunities and broader horizons for the island's youth.","popularity":0.1363,"poster_path":"/mocDw9WFNe6KPRwNLi0ykIQL8fW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":226489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cut Adrift Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cut Adrift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Wlaschin-Wiest","original_name":"Anastasia Wlaschin-Wiest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66215218e4c9eb00e6f4fa5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660459,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Deschamps","original_name":"Louise Deschamps","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6621528f78570e0164100f41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3419394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allegra Stodolsky","original_name":"Allegra Stodolsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662152ae3f483300e7734a9b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660467,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jayant Manchanda","original_name":"Jayant Manchanda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662152ca0d11f2018702058d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3103342,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erica Izzi","original_name":"Erica Izzi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662152dee640d600e5c284f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1599,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mocDw9WFNe6KPRwNLi0ykIQL8fW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254800,"name":"isle of wight"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
