Born in 1724 in KÃ¶nigsberg (now Kaliningrad), then the capital of East Prussia, he spent most of his life in his native region, bringing many books to him from France and England. The originator of the categorical imperative, this key figure of the German Enlightenment revolutionized Western thought by shedding new light on the notions of reason, tolerance and freedom. To mark the tercentenary of his birth, Wilfried Hauke presents a unique portrait of this emblematic thinker.","popularity":0.0887,"poster_path":"/eZ7xe6ewP77A8vAx0FhByjDyTcZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172145,"logo_path":"/o4b5GNR9ihIDlW9amdBFWErXJzW.png","name":"IDA Film & TV Produktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kant - The Experiment of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilfried Hauke","original_name":"Wilfried Hauke","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/onIZkLEWupAAHDYrFOGErtHeVk2.jpg","credit_id":"662397ee2e2b2c018766120a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4355286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Boosfeld","original_name":"Martin Boosfeld","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/vbZnFjlm5TgVVBwidU1aiCs8pCC.jpg","credit_id":"67465c8bd2818121221da282","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5027469,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christopher Janssen","original_name":"Christopher Janssen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67465ca795c55a2027178e5a","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qouNBKCyb6bPh8T0hjy6F3PmlSJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wZwdgepxmmHb360E7mlp6UEebSr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/eZ7xe6ewP77A8vAx0FhByjDyTcZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2mJ5ywpN0VvoZQ1vyfy8TwRCTMs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yI07rtmatGPNtIpwQr1AG2khPeJ.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/m2yXZmsrVbvB8ENQ8VUlkVC020d.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte.tv","release_date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte.tv","release_date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
