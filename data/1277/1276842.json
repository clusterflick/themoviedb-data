Unfortunately, she doesn't have the money, so her premature inheritance is to be decided at a notary appointment with her father Ludwig, who suffers from dementia. To the horror of Anne's unsuspecting mother Maria, Ludwig drops a bombshell at the appointment: There is an illegitimate daughter who is also entitled to the inheritance. Of course Anne is not going to take this lying down. She steps into the ring - for her money and for her father's love. While ex-husband Erik and his parents Renate and Günter get heavily involved in the family quarrel, son Leon is in trouble with his wife Soraya and her ex
