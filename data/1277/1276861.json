From the drama and thriller genre, the short film TO THE BODY tells the story of a woman around her mid 30s who is dealing secretly with anxiety and depression. The entire film is structured in constant loops, reinforced by routine, normal scenarios, close to the single and main character, to denote how centered in her mind she is and how overwhelmingly repetitive her thoughts become. Throughout the film, the main character shows physical symptoms, expressed with contemporary dance gestures, in the search for self-improvement and healing. A call from her body, while feeling and validating every emotion that passes through it, to transcend the mind and come back to the body. This film was made with the main objective of giving shape and body to all the emotions silenced by those people who have suffered and currently suffer from depression or anxiety.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/h0bEKTboAAWmGL9n5LdaaXIGDHD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To The Body","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cree Barnett-Williams","original_name":"Cree Barnett-Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66229474960cde0187a85175","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Massolini","original_name":"Carla Massolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66229486e4b5760164bc8881","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39932,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Bormann","original_name":"Jan Bormann","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662294943f48330186757851","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662977,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Anri Omori","original_name":"Anri Omori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662294dfbb1057014dd26e20","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662981,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yohan Aillon","original_name":"Yohan Aillon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66229536e4c9eb017cf72c22","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662979,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marcel Ruben Schön","original_name":"Marcel Ruben Schön","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662295200443c90164765d63","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662976,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jose Maria Abreu dos Santos","original_name":"Jose Maria Abreu dos Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662294ca3f483301637453cb","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Massolini","original_name":"Carla Massolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662294a8e4c9eb017cf72bc5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662978,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mara Chiappara","original_name":"Mara Chiappara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662294f2bb1057014dd26e33","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4662969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Massolini","original_name":"Carla Massolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622937dbb10570166d2d1f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30407265","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h0bEKTboAAWmGL9n5LdaaXIGDHD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1186}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
