Set in the late 19th Century, these inhabitants perform their required daily tasks while searching for each other and a greater meaning to their existence. The story is told through highly cinematic images with no dialogue and in settings ranging from a 18th Century mansion to a fire-scorched prairie, the enigmatic storylines of the two characters remain separate but interwoven.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inhabitants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tate Bunker","original_name":"Tate Bunker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662153550231f2017c11f753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Budsberg","original_name":"Brent Budsberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66215365e4b576017dbc6d78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana McCaw","original_name":"Shana McCaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662153400231f2016311657d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Budsberg","original_name":"Brent Budsberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66305f6ccb71b80123a498b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tate Bunker","original_name":"Tate Bunker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66305fbee1ad7901250805c8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana McCaw","original_name":"Shana McCaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66305f9290dde001282a0c69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shana McCaw","original_name":"Shana McCaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66305f9c0d5d850129db6091","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tate Bunker","original_name":"Tate Bunker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66305f7f6a300b0128606382","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4660475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Budsberg","original_name":"Brent Budsberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66305fa75545ca012d4380de","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milwaukee Film Festival","release_date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
