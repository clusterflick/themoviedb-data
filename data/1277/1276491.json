Known to a discriminating international fan base and respected by legendary musicians and producers, Neto has flown under the radar in service to the music and not to his own ego. Shot in California, in the UK, and in Brazil, the Man Behind the White Guitar follows José Neto as he revisits the people and places that formed his musical career: Harry Belafonte, Steve Winwood, Flora Purim, Airto Moreira, and Brazilian icon Filo Machado. Neto, as he is known to his friends and fans, follows a diverse musical path and faces significant life challenges, through which he maintains equanimity and a positive vision that speak through his compositions and his playing. Everyone he knows will say, \"Neto is my good friend.\"","popularity":0.5637,"poster_path":"/4hkO0jpBw4OtWGkeZymfyYX4pLC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":226535,"logo_path":null,"name":"McVeigh Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Life and Music of Jose Pires De Almedia Neto","title":"The Man Behind the White Guitar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Belafonte","original_name":"Harry Belafonte","popularity":0.5959,"profile_path":"/8x9zZS36gSOKiTnUwoBqYKvnYg6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66219a57e4c9eb0163f56a31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628440,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Booth","original_name":"Paul Booth","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66219a6887ae7b0188d89a8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Airto Moreira","original_name":"Airto Moreira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66219a7be4c9eb0163f56a42","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Pires de Almeida Neto","original_name":"Jose Pires de Almeida Neto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66219a91960cde0164a68491","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3828968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narada Michael Walden","original_name":"Narada Michael Walden","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kfJWXpdprAxWHSL6eMzFwIB8ev.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66219aac87ae7b0188d89aab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Winwood","original_name":"Steve Winwood","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/sqgzPJ3RTZmmlfI5VKvFrRPi2j.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66219abce4b576017dbc8ac8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378154,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Michael","original_name":"Richard Michael","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66219ae632cc2b017c0d7709","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661258,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margot Van Riper","original_name":"Margot Van Riper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66219afd3f48330186745c9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara McVeigh","original_name":"Barbara McVeigh","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66219b11e640d60163c3041d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628440,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Booth","original_name":"Paul Booth","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66219b30ae3843016e292926","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10817390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1495,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4hkO0jpBw4OtWGkeZymfyYX4pLC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":995}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
