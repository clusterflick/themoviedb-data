It speculates on the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, alluding to the historical use of woodblock printing in disseminating ideology. Woodblock printing, which emerged in 7th century China, experienced a revival during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s as a means to quickly communicate information to a mass audience. One of the key proponents in China's modern woodcut movement was Lu Xun, whose philosophy is embedded throughout the film. For instance, Lu Xun's motif of cannibalism to describe the decay of Chinese consciousness is referenced when the protagonist pulls an insect from within his own body and eats it alive.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2012-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Actions Which Haven't Been Defined Yet in the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Einige Aktionen, die in der Revolution bisher noch nicht definiert wurden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661971,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xun Sun","original_name":"Xun Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6622130a0231f2017c12f4e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661971,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xun Sun","original_name":"Xun Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662212fa0231f2017c12f4c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Berlinale","release_date":"2012-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
