Dennis does laugh though, just the once. Being a teenager in a small town in Brandenburg isn’t easy. Somehow he’s always so serious and wound up, like a tight coil.

It’s too bad that his opponent is a wrestling champ.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Film und Fernsehen 'Konrad
