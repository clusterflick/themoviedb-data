At a time when it is difficult to occupy even a square meter of residential space due to unequal economic and social conditions, artists who own or rent studios to produce art have continued to walk a tightrope between thought and reality. How is it possible to do what you want? Depending on the type of work and socio-economic conditions, the occupation method, space size and use are very different.  - Studio Score: Artists experience physical and movement perception in space and time, right in the studio.
