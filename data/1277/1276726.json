In the film, he talks about when he built a snowman called Snow Ice Monster which was then torn down and rebuilt by other children. He listens to a recording of his voice and notices that he sounds like a certain Minjung, who does not exist in real life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fwxGjfbobZepxVVT2Gr1wsLDywu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242200,"logo_path":"/Tp5lpNmRdBAAOZApYQh6RL3jig.png","name":"Space Cell","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2691728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sujin Lee","original_name":"Sujin Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662247ee7a3c52017d4db424","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fwxGjfbobZepxVVT2Gr1wsLDywu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Collectif Jeune Cinéma x Space Cell (Paris)","release_date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
