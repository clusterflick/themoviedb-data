This gripping, immersive, and cinematic experience delves into the captivating life at the edge of society, unfolding a modern-day Oedipus story. With a stolen childhood, Dalibor yearns for a father figure in a world that brings a constant struggle for one‘s place. Fakir vividly explores the raw pain that arises from abuse and trauma. This pain resides both internally within the family‘s walls and externally, where the circus‘s agonizing nailbed becomes his haven.","popularity":0.1359,"poster_path":"/rJX3SxpZc5yOF5rWICHEpWiBg4N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bright Sight Pictures","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":159283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lonely Production","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":223398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumisenta Film Foundation","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2024-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dalibor, calm down.","title":"Fakir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4851984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalibor Lezo","original_name":"Dalibor Lezo","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66a4d7d47ce1a1638a600d02","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Ďuriš","original_name":"Roman Ďuriš","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662199bae4b576017dbc8a73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Ďuriš","original_name":"Roman Ďuriš","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4d7f245d09a2abac72977","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661236,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michaela Hošková","original_name":"Michaela Hošková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4d7ffe50b5a17626762af","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4038752,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jakub Fišer","original_name":"Jakub Fišer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4d981ed986c4091b1469f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661236,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michaela Hošková","original_name":"Michaela Hošková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4d991c097b370f7b8a0ef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3124521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simona Bago Móciková","original_name":"Simona Bago Móciková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4d9a9cf96b21620b4c6ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3124520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Radka Babincová","original_name":"Radka Babincová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a4d9b7c097b370f7b8a0f6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68556,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Per K.
