The second part shows the behavior of cuttlefish during prey acquisition. Two techniques can be distinguished here: Advancing and retracting the tentacles for fast-moving and small prey; grasping with the eight short arms for defensive and larger prey. The third part of the film shows mating and reproductive behavior. The triggering signals for intercourse with conspecifics are predominantly visual.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":25006,"logo_path":"/ziWQdswTHwQ9V40O4kvhc2DYYBK.png","name":"Institut f√ºr Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sepia officinalis - Der Tintenfisch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
