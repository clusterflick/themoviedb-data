A creator of enormous, immediately identifiable steel sculptures that both terrify and mesmerise, Serra believes that each viewer creates the sculpture for themselves by being within it.  To this end, a Japanese family are reminded of the Temples of Kyoto, a Londoner finds sanctuary in the Serra near Liverpool Street station, and most movingly, a Holocaust survivor sees one piece as a wall separating the living from the dead.  Contributors include Chuck Close, Philip Glass and Glenn D Lowry, Director of MoMA.","popularity":0.481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Serra: Man of Steel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"66223c8e78570e017e11629b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Serra","original_name":"Richard Serra","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/aIKTeQv73Jhzz8qnK7Ap0GL7JYm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66223c9c8a88b20185cb73c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Glass","original_name":"Philip Glass","popularity":0.2814,"profile_path":"/dsf8ajHq4BJeTHdrwcM9OW72x4R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66237d3d07faa201879898c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Close","original_name":"Chuck Close","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/lBoC1AJz2JQtmnBkkHhzPZvoAAB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66237d4c2dda890164e022e4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2711689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Silver","original_name":"Zoe Silver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66237d2aaf9590017d6772f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553325,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janet Lee","original_name":"Janet Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662419c507faa20163986da3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","credit_id":"662419db197de401642a081f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2711689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Silver","original_name":"Zoe Silver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662419ee2dda890187e0f701","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":339039,"name":"richard serra"},{"id":339040,"name":"american artist"},{"id":339041,"name":"abstract sculptures"},{"id":339043,"name":"postminimalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
