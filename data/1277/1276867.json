Geomeunyeo evokes the sea where no water exists and reveals forms where there is no light. When one sense closes, another opens in an endless cycle. Through the filmmaker's intervention, Geomeunyeo repeatedly sinks and resurfaces. Shot on 16mm black-and-white film and hand-processed, Geomeunyeo highlights the physical nature of film and the subtle traces naturally produced during manual development. This repetition creates a poetic rhythm that moves between presence and absence, appearance and disappearance.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/ay9bwu5Qq6klk1TgqlbYvYtoG7b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242200,"logo_path":"/Tp5lpNmRdBAAOZApYQh6RL3jig.png","name":"Space Cell","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2025-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Geomeunyeo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3867720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Kyujae","original_name":"Park Kyujae","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/pZwNASzBkKkGIbd26OCw3klkhuu.jpg","credit_id":"66229437ecc7e8017ee3aba8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ay9bwu5Qq6klk1TgqlbYvYtoG7b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
