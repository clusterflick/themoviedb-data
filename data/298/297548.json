Did you wonder why? What if you had forgotten the reason? Would you want to remember if it could save you life?  Elizabeth was asked by her mentor to teach a writing course at a small college.  Since she never forgets a kindness, she reluctantly agrees.  Arriving in town, she instantly regrets her decision.  She wants to run, but she is honor bound to stay.  Even as the ghost of a small child begs her to forgive, the memories of another time arouse feelings of hatred that she doesn't understand and cannot control. When she meets Shane, all of their lives are thrown onto a dangerous collision course from which they can neither run, nor can they hide.  The question is, \"Can they overcome their tragic past or will they be doomed to repeat it?\"  Love can be a blessing or the curse that destroys a town.","popularity":1.0061,"poster_path":"/6VsPCriuPknJHmPqzW7uHXRO90h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmos Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love can be a blessing or a curse.","title":"Never Can Say Good-bye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Goode","original_name":"Conrad Goode","popularity":0.202,"profile_path":"/wcGtpT5FR5PPh9OqfS44hSyUNZT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"543de8ba0e0a266f81001115","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Estrada","original_name":"Kimberly Estrada","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/hT7UEmuFEkpEY18TH7EVuZLAWYQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lynne","credit_id":"543de8c7c3a368251f0010f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Lamour","original_name":"Lillian Lamour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ks4tLzlD0yjiPgbx1utOXjUCS3x.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shane","credit_id":"543de8dbc3a368250a0011cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John J Thomassen","original_name":"John J Thomassen","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/aCZFu4xeMCuqNQiDanTSdJ2Nink.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jefferson","credit_id":"543de8ea0e0a266f8e001153","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Hayes","original_name":"Bill Hayes","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/s7EjNs2zhHOz9Fx2W3si0ggdINr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"543de9110e0a266f770011c1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niki Cipriano","original_name":"Niki Cipriano","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sara Jane","credit_id":"543de92b0e0a266f7d001164","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Harmon","original_name":"Sean Harmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Randolph","credit_id":"543df3fc0e0a266f7a0013e4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armand Mastroianni","original_name":"Armand Mastroianni","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b72c3d092514140641a585a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Myers","original_name":"James Myers","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b72c42cc3a36818971a2748","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374138,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Theresa Chaze","original_name":"Theresa Chaze","popularity":0.1185,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b72c41b92514140681aabe5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1793224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karla Cipriano","original_name":"Karla Cipriano","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b72c4050e0a267eed1bd6e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6VsPCriuPknJHmPqzW7uHXRO90h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5484,"name":"reincarnation"},{"id":9853,"name":"paranormal"},{"id":197088,"name":"revenge plot"},{"id":207662,"name":"eternal love"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Niki Cipriano's Audition for Paranormal horror  Never Can Say Good-bye","key":"KPAFh54bUQ8","published_at":"2014-09-18T20:23:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"id":"543deabcc3a368250a001213"}]}}}
