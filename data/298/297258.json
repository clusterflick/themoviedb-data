The details of that point-shaving scandal are revealed for the first time on film through the testimony of the players, the federal investigators and the actual fixers. Playing For The Mob may be set in the seemingly golden world of college basketball, but like Goodfellas, this is a tale of greed, betrayal and reckoning. Ultimately, they both share the same message: With that much money at stake, you can't trust anybody.","popularity":1.0645,"poster_path":"/9Tn57sGwajwDOrQsEZg3Otyrvkn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":35178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steel Titan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1978, America's Most Powerful Crime Family Went to College","title":"Playing for the Mob","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Liotta","original_name":"Ray Liotta","popularity":1.8058,"profile_path":"/jdwGJbJNSRQiG2kB5MJxiu2clCQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"543c68000e0a26499e00699e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Hill","original_name":"Henry Hill","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/eDXwP90mBTyNgrsW7pou0DhbBIT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"543b25cac3a36819a100400e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Sweeney","original_name":"Jim Sweeney","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"543b25d80e0a2649a80041f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Kuhn","original_name":"Rick Kuhn","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"543b25e4c3a3681995004137","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Cobb","original_name":"Eric Cobb","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"543b25efc3a3681989003e27","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Mazzei","original_name":"Paul Mazzei","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"543b25f9c3a3681990003fe6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Lavine","original_name":"Joe Lavine","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"543b25550e0a2649a80041d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cayman Grant","original_name":"Cayman Grant","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/oNC4Tkhl6NSx4uXzjixvfe8f3IP.jpg","credit_id":"543b256c0e0a2649a1004222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4118094","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wyfREbpQm75hVHr2eOzhl8v6KWs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wmdWiiAWe5HqESzrdn0zkyzyJUm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGyu5xl6slyC9pYpTrzNacRe5SP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v5Paf2tlEfKf3VZTWL1fES0Sttb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.116,"height":1299,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uNJeapgclDm5yIGhIu3gh5JmyFh.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":4048}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9Tn57sGwajwDOrQsEZg3Otyrvkn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/woQGXOjPiLWXYmK8qyuyuAFC83Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cOIfsddAzYzKjVbchbGcFWa3TRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":862}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":417,"name":"corruption"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1680,"name":"boston, massachusetts"},{"id":3616,"name":"college"},{"id":6496,"name":"basketball"},{"id":10291,"name":"organized crime"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":231149,"name":"mob"},{"id":248436,"name":"boston college"},{"id":249992,"name":"college basketball"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"10","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Disney+","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
