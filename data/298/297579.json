Burne-Jones plays matchmaker for a young British nobleman who has fallen in love with a servant girl on his estate. The artist shows that love can thrive between members of different classes by depicting on canvas a picture from Tennyson's poem about the love of King Cophetua for a beggar maid. As he relates the story of the poem in words and through his painting, the young earl sees the application to his own situation.","popularity":0.2751,"poster_path":"/vcGQ6LESf4o1Sw3i1yiyGIoqWv5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triart Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beggar Maid","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Denny","original_name":"Reginald Denny","popularity":0.428,"profile_path":"/wbR5zRDwZpDqDwuoW5hSQbIptHW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Earl of Winston / King Cophetua","credit_id":"543e8a07c3a368250a0024dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Astor","original_name":"Mary Astor","popularity":0.4766,"profile_path":"/g5iKOHKkpTAQUNOodgCEInrmtiU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Peasant Girl / Beggar Maid","credit_id":"543e8a0ec3a3682500002715","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Blaché","original_name":"Herbert Blaché","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/kMzBOVmNGzn4Lx1xhB39KGAVQTh.jpg","credit_id":"543e89ed0e0a266f84002602","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Denny","original_name":"Reginald Denny","popularity":0.428,"profile_path":"/wbR5zRDwZpDqDwuoW5hSQbIptHW.jpg","credit_id":"543e89f8c3a36825130024ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Legaren à Hiller","original_name":"Legaren à Hiller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcb363f8595800874861d9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Maude","original_name":"Arthur Maude","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcb359726fb100cb532558","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Legaren à Hiller","original_name":"Legaren à Hiller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcb36cfa4046007d4d99d4","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0011956","wikidata_id":"Q3985837","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vcGQ6LESf4o1Sw3i1yiyGIoqWv5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
