Over the course of six months, their expedition traveled by icebreaker, canoe, and dog sled, capturing the Canadian fur trade in a silent feature documentary. The Romance of the Far Fur Country was released in 1920, two years before the legendary film Nanook of the North. Rediscovering the documentary in a British archive, another film crew begins a journey to resurrect the lost film, taking it to the communities where the film was originally shot. Images come to life; people recognize faces, landscapes, and lost traditions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Trail of the Far Fur Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374650,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Nikkel","original_name":"Chris Nikkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544011e20e0a26025f0003d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Nikkel","original_name":"Kevin Nikkel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544011f50e0a26025f0003d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374652,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Nikkel","original_name":"Kevin Nikkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5440120c0e0a26026f000423","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374650,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Nikkel","original_name":"Chris Nikkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544012220e0a2602620003ad","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374650,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Nikkel","original_name":"Chris Nikkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5440123a0e0a2602620003b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3576208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
