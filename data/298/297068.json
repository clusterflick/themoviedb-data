Who would have built these cities? It would take more than a century and two extraordinary people to uncover the secrets of ancient Maya. The american John Lloyd Stephens, together with his english companion Frederick Catherwood, enbarked upon the first of two epic voyages to central america in 1839. Facing many dangers and illnesses, they returned from the mysterious land with extraordinary stories and breath taking images from a once great civilization of native americans. One hundread years later, Mayan archaeology had made enormous advances, although the inscriptions that adorn the Mayan ruins had not been completely decyphered. It would be the extraordinary studies of the russian Tatiana Proskouriakoff, a woman in a world of men, that would reveal the true lives of the Maya to the world.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":"/pfW2a64l4rG6BUlxLkmjkpKmdII.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treasure Seekers: Code of the Maya Kings","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"National Geographic - Die KÃ¶nige der Maya","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":201507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Carroll","original_name":"Anne Carroll","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/zyLcqu4yfz4oPwlCZEmX4aYFAE8.jpg","credit_id":"543979750e0a2649a8000884","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1022282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pfW2a64l4rG6BUlxLkmjkpKmdII.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
