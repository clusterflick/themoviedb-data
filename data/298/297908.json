His wife and daughter Anna receive the guests who are invited to the feast, with a dish of pike as the main course.  But suddenly, the celebration turns sour at the appearance of an unexpected guest - namely Oberholzer's brother Alois, the black sheep of the family, who disappeared years ago. As it turns out, Alois has since changed his name to \"Obolski\" and become ringmaster of a major circus. Him and his wife Iduna quickly threaten the morals and standards of the bourgeois party, and they proceed to turn the boring proceedings into a turbulent circus show. Fortunately, after much confusion, the story ends happily - altough the pike has burned black in the oven!","popularity":0.2219,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":483,"logo_path":"/uL6KIolH7ehyNrfvpKr83YpyCC2.png","name":"Praesens-Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der schwarze Hecht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruedi Walter","original_name":"Ruedi Walter","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gustav Oberholzer","credit_id":"54413d260e0a262976001c29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margrit Rainer","original_name":"Margrit Rainer","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/vVaXB7ON3YdAsrzLdDng3xDdbJZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kattri, die Köchin","credit_id":"54413d430e0a260262002763","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inigo Gallo","original_name":"Inigo Gallo","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alois Obolski","credit_id":"54413d8b0e0a26291a001b1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Schneider","original_name":"Jörg Schneider","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/AcLpA4pELObXq1f9AaLRZWAkuGN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fritz Oberholzer","credit_id":"54413d58c3a36860ef001b44","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ines Torelli","original_name":"Ines Torelli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Iduna Obolski","credit_id":"54413d9ec3a36860e1001c1d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12743,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Max Röthlisberger","original_name":"Max Röthlisberger","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Albert Oberholzer","credit_id":"54413d35c3a3686078001ba5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374920,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emil Sautter","original_name":"Emil Sautter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54413cd60e0a2628fb001b7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürg Amstein","original_name":"Jürg Amstein","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54413ccbc3a3686098001af1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48479,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Burkhardt","original_name":"Paul Burkhardt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54413cf10e0a26293e001c20","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":291,"name":"circus"},{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
