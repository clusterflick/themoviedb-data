Farmers are having to kill calves which it is uneconomical to keep, paying token amounts to the local fox-hunt as unofficial knackers to dispose of the carcases for feeding to the fox-hounds. Why should society seem to care so much about the fate of hunted foxes and yet apparently so little about what happens to unwanted cattle which are cross-breed or the wrong sex? There is great resentment (as typified by the Countryside Alliance marches in London) to changes that are being imposed by a government that people in the country feel is neglecting their wishes in preference to those of the city-dwellers.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":"/x6WdmKOvHr0uLfx6eoVxJOTSRo8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205148,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTO Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lie of the Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Dineen","original_name":"Molly Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cqGRQX51CVbWSDu7LhQjYNFWw3o.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself/Interviewer/Narrator","credit_id":"5a9ad13e0e0a260611022663","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Dineen","original_name":"Molly Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cqGRQX51CVbWSDu7LhQjYNFWw3o.jpg","credit_id":"560301bf9251416f0f0008a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1020045","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x6WdmKOvHr0uLfx6eoVxJOTSRo8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
