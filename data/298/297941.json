On an Internet dating site she writes: 'I'm looking for people who would like to be photographed in public revealing something of themselves...' What I'm Looking For, a 15-minute high definition video, documents this adventure; the connections formed at this intersection between virtual and actual public space. The video is a rumination on the nature of photography and the persistence of vision. It is a short tale of desire and control.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":35548,"logo_path":null,"name":"House Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What I'm Looking For","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelley Silver","original_name":"Shelley Silver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54417c070e0a26633d0002d4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelley Silver","original_name":"Shelley Silver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54417c18c3a3683e0b0002a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374964,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wiliam Seery","original_name":"Wiliam Seery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54417c8c0e0a26634d00027a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374966,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wiliam Seery","original_name":"Wiliam Seery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54417c940e0a2663360002bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374965,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wiliam Seery","original_name":"Wiliam Seery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54417c94c3a3683e0e000274","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1578849","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
