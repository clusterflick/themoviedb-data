Paul moves to a new school and becomes involved with 'The Freaks', a group on the periphery of school life, those who don't fit in: scene kids, emo kids, indie kids. Outsiders. At the same time he attracts the attention of the schools twisted and manipulative bully, Roth. When Paul delivers a message from Roth to the leader of a gang at a rival school, it sparks a dangerous feud. Faced with growing pressures from both groups, Paul must decide where his friendship lies, a decision that may cost him his life.","popularity":1.3072,"poster_path":"/dZXxVF4AIxAVm994Fw3wvpwnesi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gloucester Place
