Simultaneously, Alex - a medic reluctantly dispatched onto a Turkish Merchant vessel which has rescued a group of stranded African boat people between Malta and Italy - gets stuck on the boat as the countries wage a bureaucratic war over who should take in the migrants... The stories unravel in parallel and culminate tragically when the fishermen are traced down, but by that time there's only one survivor.","popularity":0.4765,"poster_path":"/p2VPGx1FqKsGcSiADBEpgxxbIue.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kukumajsa
