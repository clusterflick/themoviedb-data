When he loses a hot story about the German army, the editor saddles him with a young female intern. Fabian hates teamwork and sticks the intern with what seems a classic tabloid story about the suicide of a man who had himself torn to shreds by a lion at the zoo. But thanks to the intern’s dogged determination, signs emerge that the story Fabian was working on and the gory zoo story are actually interlinked. Is it pure coincidence? And if it isn’t, how can Fabian fight a nebulous enemy?","popularity":0.3617,"poster_path":"/6gygb0X9tvzig1FDgk9hpP3UsIx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23406,"logo_path":"/BTYR4mdM8dQxK0cK0gPVhkXd8j.png","name":"Heimatfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":393,"logo_path":"/5lf9uTroyzjNDOyu86qWV0eqIPc.png","name":"MACT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lies of the Victors","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les amitiés invisibles","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian David Fitz","original_name":"Florian David Fitz","popularity":1.1152,"profile_path":"/wGiIOnnnwxNLGX69o7Go4WA7Tk1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Fabian Groys","credit_id":"543909e10e0a266fd90018b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1372896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilith Stangenberg","original_name":"Lilith Stangenberg","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/n8t8ICWzxmrfydHJMikh9kJgbhn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nadja","credit_id":"54390a11c3a368101c0016bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Kotterba","original_name":"Horst Kotterba","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":"/te1FNnuEUgg8ga1ARpQrcWqQYro.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hannes Hubach","credit_id":"54390a9fc3a368101c0016d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursina Lardi","original_name":"Ursina Lardi","popularity":0.211,"profile_path":"/2jkpWQwylinnqcsYP6CuN4L575x.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Corinna von May","credit_id":"54390ace0e0a266ec800185b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David C.
