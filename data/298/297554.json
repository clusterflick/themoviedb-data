In The Brain That Changes Itself, Dr Norman Doidge explores the profound implications of the changing brain in a way that will permanently alter the way we look at human possibility and human nature.  The documentary examines a blind man who sinks a basketball; a woman with half a brain who leads a normal life; learning disorders, strokes and brain traumas that are improved and cured; and chronic pain that is alleviated. The vast expanse of the brain's possibility is still unrealized.","popularity":1.657,"poster_path":"/l5qeUnONHUN5ckCntIUICUNId26.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brain That Changes Itself","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Sheerin","original_name":"Mike Sheerin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea45738af43240025a0a853","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Norman Doidge","original_name":"Norman Doidge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea4574aa2d2e9001add0043","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Sheerin","original_name":"Mike Sheerin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea4572266f2d2001a3e5919","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1537914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vUC37MTdFKwbsqjnzR5aCMAZGv0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l5qeUnONHUN5ckCntIUICUNId26.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":287067,"name":"science"},{"id":322695,"name":"brain"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
