Wendo's music, an infectious blend of Latin and African rhythms, took the nation by storm and he became an overnight star among the Congolese. However, while the sound Wendo created proved to have a lasting influence in the Congo, his own fame waned, and as he slipped into obscurity, he watched the sad history of his nation unfold, as the end of colonialism led to wave after wave of bloody violence. Wendo's music, however, has been discovered by a new generation of music fans, and the aging musician continues to perform as often as he can.","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/3oJQ52BHyg7Ndb9p24jh9zYcD3A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Rumba River","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1998049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendo Kolosoy","original_name":"Wendo Kolosoy","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5aa90fe29251415e3c03044c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Sarasin","original_name":"Jacques Sarasin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ef5156c3a368225900b948","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813390,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernard Josse","original_name":"Bernard Josse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d339692514128be041308","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Sarasin","original_name":"Jacques Sarasin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d33769251412896040a52","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1554983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rémon Fromont","original_name":"Rémon Fromont","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac67fac0e0a264974015cd5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1241326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3oJQ52BHyg7Ndb9p24jh9zYcD3A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
