The book depicts the life of Saito, who was born in Aomori and became deaf at the age of 1 due to an illness. She rebelled against her strict parents, and she ran away from home several times as a youth. At a local club, she began taking an interest in \"hitsudan\" (communicating through writing), which she later made use of when she moved to Tokyo and became a popular hostess at a Ginza club.
