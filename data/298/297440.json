One day he learns that an eccentric uncle has died, leaving him a brown derby said to bring good luck to its wearer. Meanwhile Edith Worthing and her Aunt Anna are expecting Edith's wealthy uncle, Adolph Plummer, from Australia. On a call to their house, Tommy is mistaken for the uncle, being announced as \"a plumber,\" and soon a mutual romance develops with Edith. They are wedded by mistake when serving as witnesses to marriage by elopement. Farrell, a rival for Edith, learns of Tommy's deception and persuades Edith to elope with him; but Tommy follows in hot pursuit, in his pajamas and derby. At the last minute, a message arrives telling Edith that she and Tommy are already married.","popularity":0.2547,"poster_path":"/jlxiQZ4J4AkOuNqOZdm7tst9zno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35282,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.C.
