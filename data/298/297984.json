He is a music historian and lives only for his passion. He has no patience for the ladies and does everything he can do drive them out of his classes by being super unfriendly. Even at home, he will only let himself be served by a man -- Sebastian. Sebastian, of course, doesn't let the professor know that he's actually married. Elli Martens, a student, who has gotten to know the professor through one of his classes, wants to cure the professor of his aversion to women, because she can't stand to see someone happy (what other reason can there be?). She decides to use her womanly guile to ensnare him. Posing as a married woman, who lost her husband in an auto accident during their honeymoon, she shows up at Hellwig's house on a stormy evening, begging for help. Hellwig is repulsed and tries to get rid of her as quickly as possible (AMEN!).","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/cux8f6DLE3MAWVMd9FxZIi20BNp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30107,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1941-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ehe man Ehemann wird","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Hochzeitsreise ohne Mann","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewald Balser","original_name":"Ewald Balser","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":"/AiQO3C50UzviME2rdWXWIrPixMU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Prof. Hellwig","credit_id":"5441a53c0e0a2663330005da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heli Finkenzeller","original_name":"Heli Finkenzeller","popularity":0.3144,"profile_path":"/8dUdsVt008oxEHaPRO7WbwRzR8k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elli","credit_id":"5441a548c3a3683e08000581","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Paudler","original_name":"Maria Paudler","popularity":0.2612,"profile_path":"/i7Fij3D9tcyvFwG9jFvYrtClxsZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Agathe","credit_id":"5441a5550e0a26633000059f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Carl","original_name":"Rudolf Carl","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/dssc7XtL5zSIiGpzOKtuKtIJFFo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sebastian","credit_id":"5441a5890e0a2663300005a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G端nther L端ders","original_name":"G端nther L端ders","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/5sKTXAHiOqsrF0htVp2T06MYHUp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gansauge","credit_id":"5441a5990e0a26633a00056f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Rausch","original_name":"Lotte Rausch","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/tq0LXC0UY2HiC7ZebPjdcnZxuSk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hannerl","credit_id":"5b00c76a9251410931003973","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alwin Elling","original_name":"Alwin Elling","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5441a52bc3a3683e05000606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0158597","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cux8f6DLE3MAWVMd9FxZIi20BNp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
