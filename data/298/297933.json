Aleksandrs Antonenko is Don José, the soldier who falls under her spell, and Ildar Abdrazakov plays Escamillo, the swaggering bullfighter who takes Carmen away from Don José—an action that seals Carmen’s tragic fate. Anita Hartig is Micaëla, and Pablo Heras-Casado conducts Richard Eyre’s hit production, set in 1930s Spain.","popularity":1.2555,"poster_path":"/dpMOGJEK7B7R21NIvaezHIg4t0U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan
