To prove he is a man his father sends him there to take charge of a large lumber camp, filled with brawny he-men who spend their time drinking, gambling and brawling when not cutting timber. Once there, Jack establishes himself by winning a fight against \"Dum-Dum\" Pete, the toughest man in those parts. Along the way he sees to it that a needed operation is performed on the camp's mascot, a crippled young boy, and saves his sweetheart, Marie O'Nei, that daughter of a rival lumber company, from drowning in the river when the spring thaw causes an ice-break flood.","popularity":0.2724,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ice Flood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Harlan","original_name":"Kenneth Harlan","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":"/nIiGHwnOGFrZW2pui9rUKRFPs5p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"543d285c0e0a26534a001a0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"543d2862c3a36815e5001a31","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Hagney","original_name":"Frank Hagney","popularity":0.4024,"profile_path":"/eUun6Blqa6hEBrlscgz9qnH6Ly0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"543d2868c3a36815ea001878","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Kohler","original_name":"Fred Kohler","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/lrJamRnwOSFxXUzEDbPiZvoRMxG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"543d2874c3a36815ed001acb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeWitt Jennings","original_name":"DeWitt Jennings","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/xW7FxW2kwQqaIZpNcfACbFeFbBp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"543d287a0e0a265344001aaf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1373876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitty Barlow","original_name":"Kitty Barlow","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"543d2881c3a36815de001a6a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Gordon","original_name":"James Gordon","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/ngVF1uIAGqnZULYGu43OzRV6VfR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"543d2891c3a36815f0001bd4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George B.
