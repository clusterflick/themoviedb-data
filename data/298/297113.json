When we got home and started reviewing the footage we realised we had just filmed our first full length documentary.  A scene ingrained in the lineage of the City itself, filled with effervescent dancers, storytellers and beatmakers. It was singlehandedly the most unique and in-depth tour we had ever experienced.  Featuring key players on the scene, such as DJ Rashad, DJ Spinn, Manny, Traxman & Arpebu. The team navigated through the Windy City living with the GHETTOTEKNITIANZ of Teklife.  They slept on floors, sofas and in dodgy motels with their charming hosts.\r All the while managing to obtain un-seen footage from the finest Producers, Footworkers and the good people of Chi-Town.\r Itâ€™s taken our team a long and painstaking while to put this together.\r We hope to do the people who shared their homes, talent and ultimately their lives with us, proud.\"","popularity":0.1371,"poster_path":"/j56iH7vOH4tQsAFHsMRkg83r8h8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Tryna Tell Ya","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4455273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DJ Rashad","original_name":"DJ Rashad","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/e4sryIgftJZRZ9ygiwMuoza6fj8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"658fe1331dcb776cb344a8a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"RP Boo","original_name":"RP Boo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"658fe186651fcf5f688d98ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DJ Spinn","original_name":"DJ Spinn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"658fe197651fcf5eba8daa20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny","original_name":"Manny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"658fe1a76aa8e06153eaa623","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Traxman","original_name":"Traxman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"658fe1b251a64e020af42351","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim & Barry","original_name":"Tim & Barry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658fe15064f71666a28e8ba8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6kGM3aj0bGrmMTBYxowW93MOoFA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j56iH7vOH4tQsAFHsMRkg83r8h8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
