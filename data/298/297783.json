Disguised as a painter, he causes uproar with his innocent yet eccentric behavior, disrupting the lives of strangers. Along the way, he befriends Marlene, a young woman fascinated by his unconventional charm, much to her jealous husband's frustration. As the line between sanity and madness blurs, the film humorously explores the absurdity of societal norms. Featuring a memorable cameo by Loriot, this quirky satire questions who’s truly
