He has a lot of things his grandparents never had; an electric toothbrush, two different can-openers, glasses that block blue light. He works online so he rarely needs to leave his apartment. Social interaction makes him anxious. Tom does not really need anyone, and that suits him fine. Or does it? When the day is done and he lies in bed, something tells him he is missing something or someone. One night, a knock on his door presents him with a challenge. Sometimes radical personal change is only a small step away if we would only take it.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4866736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Penwill","original_name":"Mark Penwill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66afaf07c67be05d29608d79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4866736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Penwill","original_name":"Mark Penwill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66afaf225e21869918dc2f89","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4866736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Penwill","original_name":"Mark Penwill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66afaf18912f3a8ef565c1af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4866737,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lyndon Stratford","original_name":"Lyndon Stratford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66afaf33360b68cd8139f888","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Durban International Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
