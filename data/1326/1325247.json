Shot from the front of a moving B.C. Electric Railway streetcar, this is the earliest known surviving film footage of the city. See the residents of 1907 going to work, shopping, cycling. See Vancouver landmarks like the first Hotel Vancouver, the Carnegie Library, the Hudson's Bay store.  One hundred years later in 2007, we take a trip down the same streets and note a century of change. Compare the same street scenes recorded 100 years apart.  Presented by the Vancouver Historical Society.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dk5MnXNGNVQswuaHtWz6NTU6Mpk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City Reflections: Vancouver 1907 - 2007","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":862,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dk5MnXNGNVQswuaHtWz6NTU6Mpk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2008-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CITY REFLECTIONS: VANCOUVER 1907 | 2007","key":"tsHMJma13bU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-30T16:09:31.000Z","id":"66afcfee135b3e1295e234a0"}]}}}
