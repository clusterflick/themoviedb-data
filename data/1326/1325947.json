We see how queer identities intertwined with diaspora are bound up by rejection from the home country, the struggle of racism in the host country, and the confusion of cultural assimilation in the context of ethnocultural transformation. Finally, the work delves into the reality that for people who are marginalised, either culturally, geographically, or socially is always a state of exile.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the place where we left and arrived","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4869833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Zhang","original_name":"Samuel Zhang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b1fd531579ddc7442ff0d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
