Itâ€™s a nature film that is also a city film. Silent and without text, it manifests solely as the interplay of shots, cuts and the space of the illuminated screen. This is one of six films that are part of a larger project about the San Lorenzo Creek watershed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gp2xXzwfMLcsOU6K2FRh0g3d3fU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crow Canyon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Damm","original_name":"Michael Damm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6FeqTelbYVFOOkvg4fVeT5G45aW.jpg","credit_id":"66b0312cb7d471ca8f3563fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gp2xXzwfMLcsOU6K2FRh0g3d3fU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
