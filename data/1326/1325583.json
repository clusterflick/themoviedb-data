We do have a lot of food though.\"\"  Films not Bombs is a collaborative community film about Glasgow's Food Not Bombs chapter in Govanhill. It tells the story of how they come together each week to deliver on their mission: protesting against war and capitalism by making delicious free food for anyone that fancies it. When things seem to be crumbling apart, Food Not Bombs gives a taste of what could be - a demonstration of how much can be done [and how many people can be fed!] when people are centred instead of profits.  This film came about as a result of a course [led by University of Glasgow in partnership with GMAC] in community and collaborative practice. Léo, Rosie, Kat and Morgan are all part of Glasgow’s queer community and for 3 of them, this will be their first ever film.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Films not Bombs: Soup, Stickers and Solidarity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosie Bowyer","original_name":"Rosie Bowyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b0e4ab36655db708481e1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léo Paiva Capocci","original_name":"Léo Paiva Capocci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b0e4c293cdda6226481e0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Gabriel Hares","original_name":"Morgan Gabriel Hares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b0e4d22d2dfbdb63f48ebe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kat Robertson","original_name":"Kat Robertson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b0e4edf3ee7292060523e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
