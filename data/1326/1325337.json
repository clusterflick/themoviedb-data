Thirty-five years later, alarmed by the prominent role of religion in the 2008 American presidential campaign, he decides to make a road trip, to try and understand the phenomenon. Rather than follow the candidates, however, Ziv decides to meet with religious activists supporting the Democratic and Republican candidates. From the Iowa Caucus and the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries to Super Tuesday in Oklahoma, JESUS POLITICS shows the efforts of Baptist activists for Obama, Catholics and evangelicals for McCain, Christian conservatives for Huckabee, as well as the political efforts of evangelical organizations such as Christians United for Israel.","popularity":0.1322,"poster_path":"/25drceY8L6bLPXk5MhDSJSubJgH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170525,"logo_path":"/9WZMRkq2dkMbHe8khLj4mG7uHLa.png","name":"Bo Travail !","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":183975,"logo_path":null,"name":"ITVS International","origin_country":"US"},{"id":235624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tamouz Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE BIBLE AND THE BALLOT","title":"Jesus Politics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jesus Politics: The Bible and the Ballot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Ziv","original_name":"Ilan Ziv","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66b002ec475aadd52fdc3696","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randall Balmer","original_name":"Randall Balmer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66b002fc54093e3fd5dc3264","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4867343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weyrich","original_name":"Paul Weyrich","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66b00305baf4c94de839fb0f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503155,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Shinn","original_name":"Sam Shinn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b00343d424d1c17bc2304b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610505,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ilan Benatar","original_name":"Ilan Benatar","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b0035bfe0db2c1ff2f1ccd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","original_name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b003355e21869918dc318d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Ziv","original_name":"Ilan Ziv","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b002c5f2e102c3193a0e89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584123,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chen Harpaz","original_name":"Chen Harpaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b00370f710b01744abbcd3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gini Sikes","original_name":"Gini Sikes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b003245a20088982f48358","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1297402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/25drceY8L6bLPXk5MhDSJSubJgH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
