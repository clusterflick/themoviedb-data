Pavel, a widower, is raising his son alone. Yes, and it’s not he who raises him, to be honest, but his grandfather. Pavel himself plunged into work “without days off,” either in order to drown out loneliness, or so that his son would not need anything. Only for Vova, what is more important is not material well-being, but communication with her father. Running away from after school and wandering around the ancient, wonderful city, every time he sees other boys playing chess, football with their dads, someone discussing going to the theater... And our Vovka came up with the right way to make his dream come true - to his father became a friend to him and gave him the most precious thing -
