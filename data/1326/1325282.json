Following the same protocols for pharmaceutical studies, scientists from the University of California San Diego were able to extract data from thousands of people all over the world, using a Dr. Joe Dispenza retreat as their testing grounds. This documentary reveals never before seen data on how meditation shapes everything from our mind to the tiniest cell molecules in our body. You are asked to come along on a journey to see how science has proven how powerful we are as humans through thought alone. Heal, expand, and be inspired by the potential of humanity in this groundbreaking documentary.","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Source - It’s Within You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30840004","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
