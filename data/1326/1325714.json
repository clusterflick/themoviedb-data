Shot in just seven consecutive days during the summer of 2023, it concludes the first volume of Bliss, a playlist of sounds and shapes. As the master craftsman gifts his son wings and wisdom, the film delves into the perilous dance between striving for greatness and the suffocating pull of stagnancy. This chaotic exploration bridges the warnings and epiphanic thoughts of 20th-century thinkers with the responses of today's dreamers.","popularity":1.2481,"poster_path":"/8flBdt8sGfPsEbMCvF5rdkqqihS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235698,"logo_path":null,"name":"bliss institute of sounds and shapes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fly too high and you will burn, go too low and you won't breath","title":"Daedalus","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indy Simin","original_name":"Indy Simin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Creator art installation \"Echt in Vorm' Dancer (Part of Diotima)","credit_id":"66b144755516e8ab5d2f496a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asyera Tonikoe","original_name":"Asyera Tonikoe","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer (Part of Diotima)","credit_id":"66b1448d9b2582855deb7980","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wulf Stock","original_name":"Wulf Stock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dancer (Part of Diotima)","credit_id":"66b1449b57d378f93adc64fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4869012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Marie Louise","original_name":"Eva Marie Louise","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Creator Graduation Show \"Bimbo From 010\" (Part of Bimbo Radio)","credit_id":"66b144ca5465528a8b910d23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Jung","original_name":"Carl Jung","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/4sYWoyr1StdwELV1BiacBj6GSZv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sampled Interview (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"66b1451dd20de24aea998f86","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sampled Interview (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"66b14573af117cf965052de0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Angelou","original_name":"Maya Angelou","popularity":0.3497,"profile_path":"/9dDY1bDRF7GnGlOEY5t9LrAdzw8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sampled Interview (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"66b1457c385bb4237e9e50eb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4869017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Haarman","original_name":"Tim Haarman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"dreamer","credit_id":"66b145a81bd22ef3d925ee59","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868888,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jop van Haaff","original_name":"Jop van Haaff","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"the young photographer that defined an era","credit_id":"66b14600440b540ee19112c9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4869023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Mazzarino","original_name":"Sam Mazzarino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sampled Interview (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"66b1465df6ab5f700c6feeab","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Karrenbeld","original_name":"Anne Karrenbeld","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Protagonist (Part of Dionisos)","credit_id":"66b146989d6df49531eb7950","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alice Walker","original_name":"Alice Walker","popularity":0.1861,"profile_path":"/bpVUc84FjsvxZXsVVOS8Mv5jKk4.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Sampled Interview (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"66b14814987cfaa72f6feea9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ursula K.
