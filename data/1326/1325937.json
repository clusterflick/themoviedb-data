Part of a continuing project looking at a future, world, parallel, time alternate, dimension, through a salted lens, set in an over salinated beach town. With a queer approach and a nod to 1960s French new wave cinema, the work layers a 35 voice choir with crawling digital sounds, harking to sci-fis from the past projecting somewhere into the future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"at first and then","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4869810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Matthews","original_name":"Joanne Matthews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b1f6c179f9003be64839ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
