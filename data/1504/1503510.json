It features formal interviews with the surveillance researcher Professor Clive Norris, Deputy Chief Constable Andy Trotter from the British Transport Police, a representative of Britain's largest civil rights group Liberty, a CCTV manager from a public local CCTV scheme, experts in the field of transport policing and many more.
