Since a regular motion picture can be described as a 1 dimensional array of stills, the original image could be called a video with 4 dimensions of time, or thousands of several second sequences. This video compresses and flattens that image into a single sequence by selecting frames in a helix shaped progression through the array.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6aZsg6k8FnwUjlThUoq6dA5033V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chromatic Fractures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5526671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Mouatt","original_name":"Patrick Mouatt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685bd7ad92eced1511e42f61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6aZsg6k8FnwUjlThUoq6dA5033V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
