A “wordless book” contained colored pages with no commentary, from black pages to show a person’s sinfulness, through the red blood pages of Jesus’s sacrifice, to a heart made whiter than snow, to the gold streets of heaven. It was used in evangelism to show and tell about the plan of salvation. - Terry Lindvall and Andrew Quicke, CELLULOID SERMONS: THE EMERGENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN FILM INDUSTRY 1930-1986","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5P1eAR2gF6xWklcq00tUinvPCNp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155121,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.O.
