VOICES OF MUSLIM WOMEN FROM THE US SOUTH is a documentary that explores the Muslim culture through the lens of five University of Alabama Muslim students. The film tackles how Muslim women carve a space for self-expression in the Deep South and how they negotiate their identities in a predominantly Christian society that often has unflattering views about Islam and Muslims. Through interviews with students and faculty at Alabama, this film examines representations and issues of agency by asking: How do Muslim female students carve a space in a culture that thinks of Muslims as terrorists and Muslim women as backward?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pi1aZQrjy67GpSLjhV3DYVrqugT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make
