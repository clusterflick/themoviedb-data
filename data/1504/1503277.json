Inspired by the landscape-based slow cinema of minimalist filmmakers such as James Benning and Peter Bo Rappmund, I wanted to shoot a short film capturing the area's serene beauty that temporarily distanced and sheltered us from the nation's ongoing political chaos, hence the film's title, Bubble of Tranquility. Within the comfortable confines of this outdoor liminal space, my partner and I (two lower-class transgender artists) were able to find rare momentary solace, which I wanted to document visually and sonically for my own remembrance and for other people's potential appreciation. This film is dedicated to Jayce Renner, my loving partner, and to Emily Packer, my late friend who deeply loved nature and its poetics.\" - Marzi Margo","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y5PYtwUUy5kglv1kctaVAl1PojW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bubble of Tranquility","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5525039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marzi Margo","original_name":"Marzi Margo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"685add247b04ea9e3104319a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5525042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayce Renner","original_name":"Jayce Renner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"685add31325547923906f092","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5525039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marzi Margo","original_name":"Marzi Margo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685add004ba08ffafb0431b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lzmIVbwvtmrtaAwtBLd9s5Ri0rx.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1147},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1455,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y5PYtwUUy5kglv1kctaVAl1PojW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":970}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
