She has pretty much given up on dating until a fortune teller mysteriously shows up at one of her perfectly planned parties and predicts that Gemma is one last horrible date away from true love. When Gemma goes on what she hopes is her last blind date with Nick, anything and everything goes wrong, including crashing her car into a handsome wealthy stranger, Enzo. When the fortune teller’s predictions start to materialize, once cynical Gemma is ready to take a leap of faith. But is Gemma misreading the signs? Only fate knows what’s in store for her.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32185,"logo_path":"/yeOKSwpoVWvntT6LT1kbrEA94dt.png","name":"Bell Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":266212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlequin Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":218482,"logo_path":"/hEpcdJ4O6eitG9ADSnDXNUrlovS.png","name":"The CW","origin_country":"US"},{"id":124756,"logo_path":"/464kIonX9LVW2oaygXrIeYLHcoo.png","name":"Neshama Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":266211,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centinel Media","origin_country":""},{"id":121813,"logo_path":"/7OwtRpQAFKU3KWA7InBg3h3PxqI.png","name":"Fremantle","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Second Guessing Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Panabaker","original_name":"Danielle Panabaker","popularity":2.6338,"profile_path":"/faX0EDc44GL5ZcsEcxTOBcfWpCP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gemma","credit_id":"685b0401ce8c95f725043219","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Sevier","original_name":"Corey Sevier","popularity":0.9565,"profile_path":"/wKt1pHZ5Q6kgkmZsNz53lNPzLR3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"685b0411dac07578b1fefbd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3535405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Morgan","original_name":"Brendan Morgan","popularity":0.2253,"profile_path":"/6eqJShDBTzGobdJUBFp0dB9IQuy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Enzo","credit_id":"685b04257585853e9d94dff5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3807840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyn Chugg","original_name":"Jocelyn Chugg","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/1lZ54v9UeulZMIgdUlilzlY9JOF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"685b0430ce8c95f72504321d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1432636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ari Rombough","original_name":"Ari Rombough","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/FWajBc2mzaGMKKFHC6iokxenUm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"685b043b4ba08ffafb043296","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Brogren","original_name":"Stefan Brogren","popularity":0.4032,"profile_path":"/f2fQZarkLMgJ6QLkFu1H0Qv5d1.jpg","credit_id":"685b048b78e66b053a2ca4d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5525350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandra Mircheff","original_name":"Alexandra Mircheff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685b04a71aa6b05678c9cd04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1239343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shelley Scarrow","original_name":"Shelley Scarrow","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/syoD0Xbgun2G9evy7MPsqqtOrm0.jpg","credit_id":"685b04b5c698cd844594dfee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5525351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claire Robyns","original_name":"Claire Robyns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685b04c230e1a43e2506f105","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnie Zipursky","original_name":"Arnie Zipursky","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/uRl3vKZunLlBRYhAzKfou04aiI.jpg","credit_id":"685b04dbce3e094bc2fefb60","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3259504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dayna Zipursky","original_name":"Dayna Zipursky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685b04e8a1c115580a06f14f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2638621,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Malone","original_name":"Ian Malone","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685b04fcf3daf2cd2994dfff","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1087475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzanne L.
