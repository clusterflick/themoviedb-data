She performs in surrealistic plays that seem far removed from reality. The director of these plays, Nico, believes that art is necessary now, but Daria does not feel this way. Audiences still come to see the play, where almost nothing happens. Some are looking for relief, others for peace; her mother Galya comes to see her daughter on stage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/80Vf1BQmQqsTjfd2EWo4eI6sKhM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Rain Will Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5526701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kateryna Tatarchuk","original_name":"Kateryna Tatarchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685bdd526031495a68ee67c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/80Vf1BQmQqsTjfd2EWo4eI6sKhM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mykolaichuk OPEN","release_date":"2025-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
