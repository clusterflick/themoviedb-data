Has she succeeded? Well, that's up to the individual to judge. In any case, Eva will make it her mission to create a different show, but first and foremost an absolutely hilarious one. With her awkward approach to life, she will portray the world as she experiences it. Because how do you experience the world when you've always been a little off-kilter and cultivated the awkward and the crazy? That's what Eva is trying to answer in her first solo show - Eva Jin on the Moon, which will premiere in the fall of 2025.  Since Zulu Comedy Galla 2020, Eva has been on a long journey through acting, sketches and TV programs, but first and foremost she is a stand-up comedian and has cultivated the stand-up genre for many years. It is therefore with great excitement and joy to be able to write that she is going out with her very first solo show. It's guaranteed to be fun, crazy and dam dam daaam... on the moon!","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/f2nzwUR4iTL8DpUBNe4gVoP5qoa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Eva Jin På Månen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2960528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Jin","original_name":"Eva Jin","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":"/AiKP9kEuWYTmU2kfWLJtgQfQ64S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"685a95a5e9cf9b7132a5a6c8","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kgqBxeowKUINBNTyQzDWSzFb9uo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/f2nzwUR4iTL8DpUBNe4gVoP5qoa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"Bremen Teater, København","release_date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
