The film reviews many fields of work in which women are engaged, ranging from the highly specialized to the unskilled, and shows much of it being performed by women who have come to Canada from many different lands. Placement services and information services established to help newly arrived immigrants are shown in operation. Viewed from a modern perspective, the greater part of the film accepts as normal the waste of women's talents in repetitive or service jobs while elevating this work to the status of a career. Currently distributed only in 13-minute abridged form.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yJ7LDk6q8O2EWn5zaydYijRbzuk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women at Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Sparling","original_name":"Gordon Sparling","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c2083500a04e775afa6ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Sparling","original_name":"Gordon Sparling","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c2096307350a1cac9d149","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Sparling","original_name":"Gordon Sparling","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c20a9a856b1d57306f477","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicholas Balla","original_name":"Nicholas Balla","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c20bd32883f7ae294e4cc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Crabtree","original_name":"Grant Crabtree","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c20cdfa843e5b63afa862","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c20de59f8c6ab0ac9d201","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c20f5fcced03c7291b457","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":957757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldon Rathburn","original_name":"Eldon Rathburn","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c2104f1b1ceec1d2ca970","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hV2eDdXzWSpWZk2V9x8RGrMfG1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.709,"height":916,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vhhSizLvSrILtMsARVm2hm6oa63.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1565}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yJ7LDk6q8O2EWn5zaydYijRbzuk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6282,"name":"workplace"},{"id":190035,"name":"working woman"},{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"},{"id":235671,"name":"gender equality"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
