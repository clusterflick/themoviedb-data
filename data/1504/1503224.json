After living abroad for many years, the woman faces the challenges of returning home and reconnecting with her family, including her soccer player brother Ronald, whose career was not as successful as his sister’s. On top of that, Shirley must grapple with the hard reality of ageing and the limited time she has ahead of her on the field. Within that world, the film will follow other characters, including a younger player struggling to juggle soccer and her day job, and Shirley’s rival, the daughter of a famous player trying her best to reconcile her feelings for a teammate.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":266187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goral Films","origin_country":""},{"id":266188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tres Tigres Films","origin_country":""},{"id":266189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malvalanda Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"No One Knows We Play Today","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":972021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Alvarez","original_name":"Adriana Alvarez","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Shirley Cruz","credit_id":"685ac42fa43172823be65093","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1837797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentina Maurel","original_name":"Valentina Maurel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/jN7tt3s4PTs8WhoDRvuURdVm8So.jpg","credit_id":"685ac3ef036b2d9b1a5730c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felipe Zúñiga","original_name":"Felipe Zúñiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685ac3fe4451065da2a5a73b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":196564,"name":"costa rica"},{"id":328926,"name":"based on real person"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
