These create overexposed images that, in turn, intermingle with virtual sunsets and landscapes, creating a continuous flicker between natural and artificial light. The film is based on the idea of “light machines,” understood as devices capable of controlling and transforming light. Several of these machines are used in this film: the camera itself, filters, 3D lighting, flashlights, and crystals, which serve to materialize a constant contrast between structural control and the unpredictability of capturing flashes of light.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9Q1uq274uaU2FIMzAGOtX4OM62R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2025-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Machines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4361063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Ramírez","original_name":"Jorge Ramírez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685b294d6055c730fb0432ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Q1uq274uaU2FIMzAGOtX4OM62R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3EhPBY7ZbGTlnEfpQ7f3kR2I1kX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
