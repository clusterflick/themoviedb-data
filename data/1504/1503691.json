This fleeting tableau captures a single, jarring act—the desecration of a doormat—transforming the mundane threshold between interior and exterior into a site of existential protest. With painterly framing and a defiant lack of resolution, Gorth distills the tension between etiquette and instinct into a golden moment of cinematic irreverence. Visceral, cryptic, and oddly poetic, Front Door Carpet Piss is a micro-epic of anarchic intent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kZZ9PiDA0lmJpH3mGzsX30J0ZZB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hide your carpets","title":"front door carpet piss","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5526709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gorth","original_name":"Gorth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rIzZKiRsAs8nOhS9wm6P7P0w4dL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"685bde7ec5f377c450043483","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kZZ9PiDA0lmJpH3mGzsX30J0ZZB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
