But in Iran, it is against the law for women to perform in public, and so the young girl decides to engage in her own personal protest. The street becomes her stage, and random passers-by become her enthusiastic audience. Her star rises. Seti becomes an idol of her generation, of young people who no longer want to live under ruthless political oppression. Director Soheil Beiraghi’s fourth film, produced independently, looks at life in contemporary Iran in a way that the local censors would never allow. His film fights for all those whose voice remains unjustly silenced.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Bidad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Beiraghi","original_name":"Soheil Beiraghi","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/nQxpsKKdubOnfDkkcjCfZsi6s55.jpg","credit_id":"685c3e86e02d1d159bb69da8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Beiraghi","original_name":"Soheil Beiraghi","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/nQxpsKKdubOnfDkkcjCfZsi6s55.jpg","credit_id":"685c3e8fea8420eeb9b8f7f6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779675,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Payman Shadmanfar","original_name":"Payman Shadmanfar","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685c3ea2a88fa7d113aee71d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612273,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bamdad Afshar","original_name":"Bamdad Afshar","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/w9XlTNcCo8pZh4wf0idQbiTM5RL.jpg","credit_id":"685c3eae969d55c80fb8f805","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Beiraghi","original_name":"Soheil Beiraghi","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/nQxpsKKdubOnfDkkcjCfZsi6s55.jpg","credit_id":"685c3ebb258cfdc108a90747","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Beiraghi","original_name":"Soheil Beiraghi","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/nQxpsKKdubOnfDkkcjCfZsi6s55.jpg","credit_id":"685c3ec64125e007f631b91f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37437746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Premiere | Karlovy Vary International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
