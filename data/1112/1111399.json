Renowned for his boxing skills, speed and ability to slip punches, the famed southpaw became an oriental champion at all weights from bantamweight to lightweight. To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \"Flash\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \"feared no man but was humble before all men.\"","popularity":0.2358,"poster_path":"/bzPt5TMGQgAHwt61Tynggy4aedS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cirio H.
