His seemingly innocent voyeuristic addiction soon opens the door for more serious crimes as he becomes deeply involved in the lives of the people he watches. Brodi Roberts and Aaron Talbot star in MUSICAL CHAIRS - the tragedy of six strangers who awake one morning to find themselves poisoned by a man they've never met. Taunting his victims by telephone, the mystery man guides the group to locations containing the antidotes, only to provide some with the cure and others with death. VISIONS tells the tale of a disgraced police detective (Matthew Kloster) afflicted with premonitions of murders before they occur. Only his former partner believes his claims, hoping his dreams will lead her to apprehend a serial killer.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/j0gwPVsAfXkCJlHqk4g0lzzPuKN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236031,"logo_path":null,"name":"tyrant pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Violence... sweet, sweet violence...","title":"Seg/me/nts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Strange Crimes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murray Utas","original_name":"Murray Utas","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Intruder","credit_id":"66b7249a340f0fed8ca7b4e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Talbot","original_name":"Aaron Talbot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jonathan Rooney","credit_id":"66b724fe425e17c53f017c21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Kloster","original_name":"Matthew Kloster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"James Parker","credit_id":"66b7253d1d694ae016a7b424","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brodi Roberts","original_name":"Brodi Roberts","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Steve MacKenzie","credit_id":"66b725941f7c188902c60bed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Northrup","original_name":"Andy Northrup","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eddie Bunker","credit_id":"66b725ececc808bbc9c60ad5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Christou","original_name":"Tiffany Christou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"April Kilbourne","credit_id":"66b7265720817ac8afaa8be3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krista Nebloch","original_name":"Krista Nebloch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jennifer Heatley","credit_id":"66b726cbd00666c92ca7b348","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2844767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan R.
