This is true not only inside the screen of individual cuts, but also in the direction of the entire time axis. The time that flows here is a cinematic time that was newly created using the time that flowed when Mr. Kazufumi Kobayashi created a stag pattern out of paper. If we say that time is a function of motion and space, then this can be rephrased as cinematic motion and cinematic space generated by the film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jv35RLn87YDVqoEMe0hpuCxZG3v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entomologist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kobayashi Kazushi","original_name":"Kobayashi Kazushi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64342c2de92d830097c68374","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshihiko Furubayashi","original_name":"Yoshihiko Furubayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64342c0eec455200f33ea694","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1821015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yo Ota","original_name":"Yo Ota","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64342b986dea3a00b5500c7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2872123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun Miyazaki","original_name":"Jun Miyazaki","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/9yaY9pETcAj6Y0IXB8UFdYWyu6B.jpg","credit_id":"64342bb76dea3a00b5500c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003527,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Osamu Yamazaki","original_name":"Osamu Yamazaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64342c4722af3e00f491d5dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jv35RLn87YDVqoEMe0hpuCxZG3v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
