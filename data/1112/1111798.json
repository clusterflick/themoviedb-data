To the north stand the steep reliefs of the Highlands; to the south lie the rolling plains of the Lowlands. To discover these lands, there's nothing like a trip aboard the luxurious Royal Scotsman. This train crosses the whole country from Edinburgh to the Wild West Coast, reminiscent of when Queen Victoria and Prince Albert traveled by rail to their summer residence. Departing from the capital, the convoy takes the Glenfinnan Viaduct, immortalized in the Harry Potter saga, before meandering at the foot of Ben Nevis, Scotland's highest peak.","popularity":0.0863,"poster_path":"/cYRo30JRtMXVKKHGeDOa30K3tcl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86718,"logo_path":"/tw1SVioAxByZQqUlZLEoE6ofoiO.png","name":"Doclights","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unterwegs in Schottland","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeannine Apsel","original_name":"Jeannine Apsel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fffa3162f335017d5255dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24215116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/s3V52INAU3qARz5ji0zoL0uZQ0M.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2gRri0PlTnQdyQYigOdatfjipIO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cN9eeUo56FeJVs6JHbrxP2I9xRl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cYRo30JRtMXVKKHGeDOa30K3tcl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9SMhvRHOTkXEz2RvL4iYgSQSYd7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315878,"name":"ecosse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
