The story of Uncle Hsin-kao and landscapes is told by interweaving a variety of climbers, scenery and Bunun Narration. The narration implies the presence and absence of certain characters in Taiwan history. Through the off-screen voice, a layer of discourse is created with the narrator's role, Bunun's lines, and the images. The absence of the indigenous people in the history of photography, the presence and revisit of the crew, the reports and postcards created by Uncle Hsin-kao reveal a poetic story between Uncle Hsin-kao and landscapes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pS1iNQVOCmhyC9b42UnJ3t47Txs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Your Bros.
