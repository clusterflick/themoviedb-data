Just after the earthquake, TV Iwate’s phones had been ringing off the hook with people wanting to know if their families are O.K. As a local broadcasting station, TV Iwate got name lists of evacuees from evacuation centers, took video messages and broadcasted it on their news programs or information programs every day. The length of footages that TV Iwate has shot this region reached approximately 1,850 hours for 10 years.  Each victim lives out their life in their way with unresolved grief. Sachiko couldn’t find her husband in the end and took 6 years to accept reality. It was necessary for her to have kept writing countless letters to him. On the other hand, Kayoko and Daisuke couldn’t have a wedding, but they raise twins under the coronavirus crisis.  10 years of progress, we’ll never forget it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qOQkLRZJxxfR4PqcYrjTFlGD5qw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tossed but not Sunk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Endo","original_name":"Takashi Endo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6433beee6dea3a00b54fd3db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qOQkLRZJxxfR4PqcYrjTFlGD5qw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
