The lower layer shows a snowy field landscape, across which the camera slowly moves. A second layer has been superimposed on top of this: an image in which we recognize graphic shapes. Letters – without us being able to make words out of them – and composite patterns. Halfway through the film, the upper layer changes: the white letters become transparent, and the transparent sheet on which the letters and patterns appear becomes white: the positive image becomes negative.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1985-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wende","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320459,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claudia Kölgen","original_name":"Claudia Kölgen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64332eab6dea3a00b54f8c9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
