Theories from scientists and philosophers are discussed. Focusing on Mars. Ideas from science-fiction authors H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs are brought to life with colorful animation. Pulp science fiction comics of the time are parodied. Life on other planets is considered, profiling each of the planets in the solar system from the perspective of what would happen to man on them.  A masterpiece of animation and sci-fi that was way ahead of it's time. Ward Kimball was perhaps the most inventive of all Disney animators and probably the only one who admitted to experimenting with psychedelic drugs in the 60's. Also the only animator who Walt Disney ever called a \"genius.\"","popularity":0.8133,"poster_path":"/onzqwjPd2seY2JcLHTAIC8HtSxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mars And Beyond","title":"Disneyland: Mars and Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"656aab3688634800ea465b9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wernher von Braun","original_name":"Wernher von Braun","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/iBMGKFLHhWs8Q9SClVyz5vcax5r.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656e6b1d05a5330100f3b841","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4412968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Stuhlinger","original_name":"Ernst Stuhlinger","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656e6b42886348014d857627","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lionel A.
