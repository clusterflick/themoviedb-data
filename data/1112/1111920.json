This elegiac account uses symbolic representation from natural elements in order to convey the inevitability of remembering the social and cultural erosion, and places a layer of texture in front of the elliptical glimpses of imagery, separating the viewer from the past. The re-occurring image of flames remains untouched by the erosion aspects of reticulation, ultimately alluding to nature's powerful quality.","popularity":0.2703,"poster_path":"/qHtXzU0xzRp6Hor8F8K5P2eQC2J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1967810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wenhua Shi","original_name":"Wenhua Shi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6435d5fc1f748b0113ba984a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0485456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":882,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v8OP9fBFRAAtxO7upjNX9rLRaSZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1569}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qHtXzU0xzRp6Hor8F8K5P2eQC2J.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v1FG4HPDq1UE4ABFo8Lt2vMi6ao.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":596}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227202,"name":"structural film"},{"id":282732,"name":"abstract cinema"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
