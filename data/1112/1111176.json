Thornton describes the spinning funnel-shaped being that is the subject of the episode as the embodiment of the \"artificial intelligence\" represented by both the TV that raised Peggy and Fred, as well as by Thornton as invisible camerawoman and director. Here, an electronically-produced voice announces the dissolution of all meaningful elements of humanity, making claims that are at once horrific and comical.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Thornton","original_name":"Leslie Thornton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64337b72310325009a21f79a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
