Old and ill, he has returned to his hometown. His once grand estate is now in ruins. The memories of his childhood, mother and father, Young-ae, his love, are his only escape from his old and shabby present. The beautiful sorceress of the village hands out despair and the rag-like lepers appear to be his reflections. A portrait of life's fragility and longing is painted through the contrast between the past and the present, life and death, beauty and ugliness.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/62oHStiOG3KnUee6yz3UcVwVo0m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197599,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kuwol Dang Planning","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1994-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In a Handful of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"한 줌의 시간 속에서","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeon Moo-song","original_name":"전무송","popularity":0.2987,"profile_path":"/izJLjZyJ7RMPxUg4WlJP9ix5ShK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6435674692e55b00f47f63fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Mi-Kyung","original_name":"Lee Mi-Kyung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6435676292e55b0077f9f633","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Min-ho","original_name":"Park Min-ho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6435677fcca7de00bd213a42","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sang Il-hwan","original_name":"Sang Il-hwan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6435678d92e55b00d5189118","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Geum-seok","original_name":"Yang Geum-seok","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"643567a3ec8a430219267705","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005257,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Choi Chan-kyu","original_name":"Choi Chan-kyu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643567d0ec8a43025fb84a56","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baek Il-Sung","original_name":"Baek Il-Sung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643567b4ec8a43021926771b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4005255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baek Il-Sung","original_name":"Baek Il-Sung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643567c5af432400e02d3e71","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14050900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/62oHStiOG3KnUee6yz3UcVwVo0m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1994-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
