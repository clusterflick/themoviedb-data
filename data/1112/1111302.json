Natsumi, a fourth grader, is on her way to school when she suddenly decides to run away from home.  She leaves her school bag in a luggage locker, and heads for her grandmother's house, who lives far away. Her grandmother is surprised by her sudden visit, but she understands Natsumi's feelings and welcomes her warmly.  Natsumi is exhausted from the stress of her parents' bad relationship.  Natsumi's heart begins to relax as she spends the time with her grandmother and her neighbors, who seem to be enjoying themselves without a care in the world.
