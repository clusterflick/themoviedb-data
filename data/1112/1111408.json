In this work, such changes were captured at intervals of a few seconds, rather than frame-by-frame. Without a timer or anything, I set the camera on a tripod in my room, sat down on a chair beside me, and pressed the release bit by bit, entirely manually from before dawn until the sun went down.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/3ZZAb1xDOCWBR6I7fDPcJXcDeYk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Succession Intermittente","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1821015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yo Ota","original_name":"Yo Ota","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64342d721f98d10268b312e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZZAb1xDOCWBR6I7fDPcJXcDeYk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
