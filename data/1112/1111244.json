In the middle of the Yi Dynasty, when the government's national defense power was weakened and the people's livelihood was in ruin due to the actions of Tamgwan-ori, barbarians from the north began an invasion, putting the country's fortunes in jeopardy. Accordingly, Hong Jeong-seung, Hong Gil-dong's biological father and a member of the Left Council, organized the Hwalbin Party and recommended Hong Gil-dong, who had committed crimes against the country, to the king, and the king willingly appointed him as the vanguard of the Northern Expedition and sent him on a campaign. Hong Gil-dong fights bravely, defeats the barbarians, rescues his fiancée who was kidnapped by the barbarians, and returns home.","popularity":0.1503,"poster_path":"/8L3L4vjucrAq9WQlI27RC4Ig2td.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Segi Trading Co., Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1969-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"General Hong Gil-dong","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3657806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yong Yu-su","original_name":"용유수","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cbb7d52308464a2198e6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4727052,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heo Gyun","original_name":"허균","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/sY0te1pC9UGna6Iqg4XvOZmNBo5.jpg","credit_id":"664cbbcefe7ce324147775eb","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2031557,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jo Min-cheol","original_name":"조민철","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cbc019501519c9d1e162a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680272,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jang Hyeon-su","original_name":"장현수","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cbc20e68b7c68cb79933b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3170597,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeon Jong-Kun","original_name":"전정근","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ubYX79iyOd51BXsWVu6mgmA3qpD.jpg","credit_id":"664cbc3bee8cab60d77990e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4186413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hwang Gu-hyeon","original_name":"황구현","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cbc5cf02cee3d9e1e260a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727196,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Han Gyu-hun","original_name":"Han Gyu-hun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cbc81b70f990006f2e21e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Special Effects Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4896003,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Doo-hyung","original_name":"Lee Doo-hyung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c4beabf2416017bfd109ce","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/8L3L4vjucrAq9WQlI27RC4Ig2td.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/oETtcuhIyc2KEugys3m4ZHbBK8U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
