Time and again, knights desert to the counter-realm of the sorcerer Klingsor, who had previously been rejected by the circle of knights. With the help of seductive women, above all Kundry, he succeeds in bringing down the knights. He is even able to tempt the Grail King Amfortas into a misstep. He steals his sacred spear and inflicts an incurable wound. As a result, Amfortas' ritual duty of unveiling the Grail has become an ordeal. Only a pure fool is destined to undo the Grail King's fall from grace and reverse its devastating consequences.","popularity":0.2089,"poster_path":"/dzomX8wtpZJCkHrabYmio4DpfXC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":246,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Պարսիֆալ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Parsifal","credit_id":"61f9713dfe6c1800c2076a18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Amfortas","credit_id":"61f9714b5f2db100a2aa6bb0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1559109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Zeppenfeld","original_name":"Georg Zeppenfeld","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/k8Nd6GsmwGirrDUIK51aC0SNRQB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gurnemanz","credit_id":"61f9715fb6abc400f038da26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":471356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Garanca","original_name":"Elina Garanca","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/2xLi7RtxE1j2FQMuaXvVXkRjIr2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kundry","credit_id":"65a6dba08e20c5012809f3f4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Koch","original_name":"Wolfgang Koch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gHXse4IxgNWzYtTEHE6QanQM5He.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Klingsor","credit_id":"67194ba1b3d5cbb842f3c372","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leopold Knötzl","original_name":"Leopold Knötzl","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627938e9a80236141275ca5c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3542638,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wolfram von Eschenbach","original_name":"Wolfram von Eschenbach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627938fcd7a70a17a7f5ca0e","department":"Crew","job":"Poem"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Serebrennikov","original_name":"Kirill Serebrennikov","popularity":0.2299,"profile_path":"/csxQOPUf3xoew4lEjXiWgFRWJV7.jpg","credit_id":"627939079979d234fdf8719a","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Beyer","original_name":"Michael Beyer","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/8gMfqEcOc70CZERoSq5nGcNSzLo.jpg","credit_id":"61f970d4bb105700a0b49322","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"61f970f2dfaae900f5e07cc9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14700276","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dzomX8wtpZJCkHrabYmio4DpfXC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
