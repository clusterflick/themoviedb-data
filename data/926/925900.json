No crises, no affairs, no weariness. They looked for each other and found each other, say their friends Conny and Bernhard, who fight a lot and often. If a marriage is harmonious, it is this one. However, when Agnes became socially involved in addition to her job, the distribution of roles in the family, which had worked well for years, was thrown out of balance. The change in their relationship leads Agnes and Gregor into their first major crisis, which neither of them can deal with. They are shocked to find that they are about to lose love.","popularity":0.4671,"poster_path":"/7SkwempyrEcJk1dLF5owTCe3Wv6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114791,"logo_path":"/jeTQ9G3haIbLn8Shrc9OxPafST6.png","name":"Constantin Television","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wo ist die Liebe hin?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Where the Love Is Gone?","type":"informel literal English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1079462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrike C.
