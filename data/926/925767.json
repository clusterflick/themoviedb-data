Nevertheless, even in a period like this, it is still men who control the fate of womankind. During that period, the celebrated poet, YU Jen falls for charms of SHAU Tao. However in the long run, he still does not wish to marry her due to her social status. Having a very high esteem for herself, SHAU Tao prefers to remain single for the rest of her life rather than make sacrifice to accommodate such a situation. The plot switches back and forth from the letters sent between SHAU Tao and YU Jen's wife. The film reveals an undercurrent of a homoerotic relationship and the subtle relationship between three of them.","popularity":0.1811,"poster_path":"/6YLQSu0MJeVIy69kzeMDh5YDvAd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Gifted Female Scholar","title":"Legend of Shue Tao","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Lam Wai","original_name":"林偉","popularity":0.4166,"profile_path":"/qy3cJD5hXcARQhAv1sxFPBbWDRd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61dd5efab0040a008e8d75cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1562221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mondi Yau Yuet-Ching","original_name":"Mondi Yau Yuet-Ching","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":"/tfyB4WtQ4nodJQZjoBS14ej3n53.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61dd5f0168b1ea008dc9cf53","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiou Muh-Chyi","original_name":"Chiou Muh-chyi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a87e3e06bd0cefa6e05d5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15388280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u3CIOnzcsQ2GlvNcopSLxUf4OjM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qP4XcM40kPzcgOCyv9hEhARvHiY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6YLQSu0MJeVIy69kzeMDh5YDvAd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
