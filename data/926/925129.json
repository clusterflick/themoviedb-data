Filming took place over six weeks from April to May 2014. The camera follows 300 revolutionaries who took over the building of the Regional State Administration in the center of Donetsk and declared the independence of the region. The revolutionaries see themselves as the saviors of their people from the bloodthirsty fascist government based in Kyiv. This is a story about how to make a revolution and what happens after that when you get the power. The heroes of the film are Andrei (\"Lenin\"), who leaves home and mother to change history; the speaker of the new government, Vladimir, and the head of the internal anti-corruption security service, whose task is to capture and interrogate traitors, fascists and enemies of the Revolution. When the heroes believed they had won, their fates abruptly changed course.","popularity":0.2353,"poster_path":"/12BfJWdXIhq3hioQ46ZwgUaqLVz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11286,"logo_path":"/tRA2THz3uVsc5LayTeMz7fGyp65.png","name":"Artline Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":167588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rogue Fis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Donetsk People's Republic (or the curious tale of the handmade country)","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antony Butts","original_name":"Antony Butts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659e542824b33300961bd074","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18286624","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1069,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1zqUS32QQVJ0ORSPf6BFidLlZac.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1900},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zkJiofJyd7svNMCU9WioU8ln6LQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/wkfA7q7UphSts5AwiFzykZsn6yd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/12BfJWdXIhq3hioQ46ZwgUaqLVz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rHgl54Z2TukVabwkF03eGPYy1ET.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
