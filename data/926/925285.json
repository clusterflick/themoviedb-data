The film is a non-sequential account of personal narratives and reminiscences ruptured by violence, undermined by erasure and over-ridden by official documents that challenge truth. Made over nine years it explores memory as a mode of resistance, constantly confronting and morphing- from the personal to political, individual to collective. It looks at the ways in which those affected by violence have no choice but to remember.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5phJxrSeys4GuryfeUidcAhY3fN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khoon Diy Baarav","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3375965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iffat Fatima","original_name":"Iffat Fatima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61db9c2dbf09d100a5ca712f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5phJxrSeys4GuryfeUidcAhY3fN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
