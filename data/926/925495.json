The drama follows the day of the burial in which death, assumed to be a consequence of the city's violence, attracts uncomfortable comments. Bia faces the feelings of others while repressing her own suffering for losing Iris, who returns in insistent memories, alternating between warmth and melancholy. The memories reveal the intimate relationship between the two as they fall in love, and reveal an abusive relationship in Iris' past. Bia's anger contrasts with the affection between the two, in a truce amid pain, the memory of love makes life worth living.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/swa1741AMJltempiRBdw6BZopmJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quem
