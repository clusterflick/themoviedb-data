The Daring Gang of Nineteen from Verdun City (aka 19 Heroes of the Green Mountain) portrays how Sha Yen practices kung fu with her eighteen fellow male disciples, vowing to seek revenge for the murder of her parents.  Produced by Hsin Hwa Motion Picture Company in Hong Kong, it was shot in Taiwan and featured the local landscape. The credits show that renowned director Sung Tsun-shou worked as script supervisor on the production. The theme, “avenging the murder of one’s parents”, is typical of a traditional martial arts movie. Siao Fong-fong as a lovely young swordswoman in the film left a deep impression on countless fans.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":"/bO6CxgJRyadobxCijYdu4Sio2vx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1960-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Daring Gang of Nineteen from Verdun City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Siao Fong-Fong","original_name":"Josephine Siao Fong-Fong","popularity":0.3757,"profile_path":"/aO8CRYiKw8UwoW27okaEjUmghT9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61dd3f47b04228001c67f7c2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tu Kuang-chi","original_name":"Tu Kuang-chi","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/4T0VG2H4Bmd1sTlOcSguhvkkxCR.jpg","credit_id":"62d968914a52f8004e15532f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0053197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1120,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bO6CxgJRyadobxCijYdu4Sio2vx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
