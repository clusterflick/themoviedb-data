As Maud now comes back to them, they have been together for 25 years, have three more or less grown-up children and are in the midst of a separation. Through charming flashbacks to the turbulent years with small children, shortly after the turn of the millennium and swooping down in the current relationship in transformation, a unique portrayal of life’s great undertakings – life-long love – arises. But how do you go on with life without your better half? How will the kids react and can a separation be the only way for love to survive?","popularity":0.0864,"poster_path":"/8LTEitun5QE5rpJJZHrjXjKZAN1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love & Divorce","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maud Nycander","original_name":"Maud Nycander","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/1oH7dqnpBko8xRv4zI3zwGUwthI.jpg","credit_id":"61dd991c8cfcc7008be3c6e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17055670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKZBHCS7OIyjkrPluA7kr4bM1Ma.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wVN51468txmdrFJCKb7tEkVwUxf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/8LTEitun5QE5rpJJZHrjXjKZAN1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/lbu6Lj3O1bzIt9CBDO6PQNoNeXQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"7","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
