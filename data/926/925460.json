In response, Major Hammond, who oversees the troops, requests that President Abraham Lincoln send twenty thousand more soldiers to come to his aid. Lincoln grants Hammond's request, and sends along Capt. Allen, who is knowledgeable about Indians. At his new post, Allen discovers that a Confederate spy has been fomenting trouble with the Indians. Allen eventually uncovers the spy, makes peace with the Indians and wins the love of Dorothy, a young woman who lives at the post.","popularity":0.231,"poster_path":"/rkXR1U7QxnCTcDU5Qv8bkehmG5A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Overland Telegraph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim McCoy","original_name":"Tim McCoy","popularity":0.4692,"profile_path":"/d176BmvSvxIkFSgpFSunE2nLQGO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Captain Allen","credit_id":"61dc4af212197e00a2039e06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Janis","original_name":"Dorothy Janis","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":"/5jKPkvRADTqlpWp6q7pjHoPNDK6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"61dc4b0412197e006a42312e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Rice","original_name":"Frank Rice","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/4oPeFDgKMiM9e8C37izgx62HHSu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Easy","credit_id":"61dc4b144539d00066a79031","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawford Davidson","original_name":"Lawford Davidson","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/L2UOOkrlT6srNPtAkdbJjaxvp3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Briggs","credit_id":"61dc4b216654080042bb5a8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Geldart","original_name":"Clarence Geldart","popularity":0.1705,"profile_path":"/mp21zAOOXkscd5QNKLTw5FH849E.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Major Hammond","credit_id":"61dc4b3f5c564e00695c8dfa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chief John Big Tree","original_name":"Chief John Big Tree","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/3DG40Di69vQ20CrmvuqEd5nk3Rj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Medecine Man","credit_id":"61dc4b596654080042bb5afb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Mills","original_name":"Joseph Mills","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Abraham Lincoln","credit_id":"61dc4b636c8492001c669cb7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89231,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arthur Reed","original_name":"Arthur Reed","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6508bae9109dec014f42087c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Waters","original_name":"John Waters","popularity":0.1392,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61dc4b857352050066ce921a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395119,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George C.
