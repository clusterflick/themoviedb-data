The film is shaped by an unedited recording made of a Pitjantjatjara women’s song cycle: \"Two Women\", which describes the travels of ancestral women through this region. The film is not a literal interpretation of the song story, and there is no translation of the song. We are outsiders to this culture, and must therefore learn what we can from the ‚surface’ of the song cycle – from the voices singing, talking, whispering, coughing, laughing, reprimanding children.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mkqh6uSBMyEYVhsYqLkI7Dx8rGg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1976-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinne Cantrill","original_name":"Corinne Cantrill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e915db4ca67600750eef90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Cantrill","original_name":"Arthur Cantrill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e915cd12b10e0046badb01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mkqh6uSBMyEYVhsYqLkI7Dx8rGg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xWYIh6cgrpYf2kZxJ0WtgGprw0n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
