One of these pieces was a silent narrative piece. 15 years later, O'Neill went back to this footage and created an entirely different film using out-takes.

Burroughs.","popularity":0.1023,"poster_path":"/7EVEAAwS3LQjiLMYkXVcdIoTOVB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edge Uppermost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3155140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estela Garcia","original_name":"Estela Garcia","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"60ec4f05ce5d82004703a618","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3155143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar J.
