A long line of infectious diseases have devastated and in some cases destroyed entire societies. This documentary examines the causes of epidemics. It also sheds a light on the impact infectious diseases have had on politics and societal change. Today, the world is facing COVID-19. Measures such as quarantine and lockdowns are being rolled out in an effort to control the spread of the virus; and some are questioning how effective they are. Over the centuries, scientists managed to develop treatments and medicines to help control or even eradicate infectious diseases. Virologists are facing that task again with the coronavirus, as the world frantically searches for ways to overcome a pandemic which threatens our modern way of life.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/t8Tbr6Gn5HUylAhRoGpTFk9tJIs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilot Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plagues and Pestilence: How Pandemics Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Hope and Fear: How Pandemics Changed the World","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Πως οι πανδημίες άλλαξαν τον κόσμο","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Walker","original_name":"Helen Walker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60e8a9b24d6791002d8d04fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Cross","original_name":"Ian Cross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8aa25b7d352002fa88c70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Cross","original_name":"Ian Cross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8aa17ec8a430047446155","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Cross","original_name":"Ian Cross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8aa39b76cbb005d05fb3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jake Michael Christian","original_name":"Jake Michael Christian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d222febdd568004187059d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187253,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Mounsey","original_name":"Paul Mounsey","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d222e349756000421f0d95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Helen Walker","original_name":"Helen Walker","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d222ef9a3c4900417c7dd0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jake Michael Christian","original_name":"Jake Michael Christian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d22307f1b571001df3fbb7","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367620,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emilia Crudo","original_name":"Emilia Crudo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d223117b7b4d001ce5e4e0","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13928292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t8Tbr6Gn5HUylAhRoGpTFk9tJIs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zjTResMgsfxBXV7LMEKaFpU4Bya.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
