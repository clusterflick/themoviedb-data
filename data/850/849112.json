As they travel the continent to learn more about those caring for and studying pangolins they are captivated by these strange, secretive creatures and document the race to save them from being poached to extinction. The film was released Endangered Species Day in May 2019 and our goal is to make it the most watched wildlife documentary ever. Therefore we've made it freely available as an open source documentary, accessible for viewing by millions of people around the world via YouTube, through educational establishments and at screenings supported by international conservation organisations everywhere.","popularity":0.1326,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye of the Pangolin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3152002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Young","original_name":"Bruce Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8de864ca676005e1e6d86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11105430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":211505,"name":"wildlife conservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
