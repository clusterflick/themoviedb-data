Everybody is living the same life, no matter where they are, whether in Rome, Paris, or New York. Every story is the same, yet unique. But a worse virus is lurking within human nature itself.\r Four housemates in their twenties face troubles wrought by more than isolation alone while scheming to make easy money at their shady landlordâ€™s expense. In the delirious setting of this tragic comedy their choices become more and more ambiguous, and the consequences are bound to shatter their hopes and dreams and redefine their loves and fears, in a crescendo ending with an unexpected twist.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"#StayHome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roan Johnson","original_name":"Roan Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60eb1d69e004a6007545dd19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
