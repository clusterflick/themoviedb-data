It starts like a documentary about the declining Yongsan Electronic Mall, but all of a sudden changes into a story about a poor couple wandering around the mall after finding out about their unexpected pregnancy. Could the first documentary part of the film be a long prologue for the drama? Or is the drama a needed source to complete the documentary? Either or there wouldn’t be much difference in experiencing what the characters and the mall is about to face. However, the second question makes it sound more interesting. The film starts with a clip from a surveillance camera which could feel like something more than a documentary, it then passes a participation stage showing interviews and finally meets the performance form.
