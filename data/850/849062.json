Inspired by Akesuk’s iconic drawing entitled Red Spider (2014), this experimental short employs the technique of stop-motion animation while making reference to the actual behaviour of the Arctic Wolf Spider, a genus of arachnid common across the North. Climate change has resulted in larger populations and increased predatory tendencies of this carnivorous and cannibalistic spider. This sci-fi influenced short animates the growing discourse around the ecological, political and cultural future of Canada’s Arctic. Background imagery was shot on location in Cape Dorset, Nunavut.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2psTpUJK44bUC9Qdoic9q3nOvh8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Spider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3151747,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Saimaiyu Akesuk","original_name":"Saimaiyu Akesuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8a68a83ee67005dec3cd9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151748,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cheryl Rondeau","original_name":"Cheryl Rondeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8a6964ca676005e1dec6c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151748,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cheryl Rondeau","original_name":"Cheryl Rondeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8a6b0d37197002a4ef193","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151748,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cheryl Rondeau","original_name":"Cheryl Rondeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8a6b6d37197002a4ef1a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3151747,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Saimaiyu Akesuk","original_name":"Saimaiyu Akesuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8a6beb7d3520046dc975d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2psTpUJK44bUC9Qdoic9q3nOvh8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ice Spider","key":"335745037","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-12T22:34:00.000Z","id":"60e8a6f5b7d3520075be0d05"}]}}}
