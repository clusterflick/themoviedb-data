Interspersed with an amusing mockumentary, in which a kid tells the “history” of the Miraflores neighborhood, this short film is a tender and fresh portrayal of a potentially anonymous place in the suburbs, filling it with a beautiful and transformative affection. The first shots of an architecture with no personality show the contradictions of cities and their communities.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/lEvtNU6xeNdTxtXd9ZHrGgih37j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curtas-Metragens, CRL","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miraflores","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3174934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filipe Cates","original_name":"Filipe Cates","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/w4r33i0EtWIBXNOIBkujZboGCkw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61004b58cee4810075e1c548","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2208078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Safira Robens","original_name":"Safira Robens","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/mTGVQcAiFnAwIMw1LRWrwm4Subq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61004b6e0d5d85007fdd3be3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3174935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Quinkardete","original_name":"Vera Quinkardete","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61004b820d5d8500473ea15f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3174936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valdemar Dória","original_name":"Valdemar Dória","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61004b917ad08c0046ed9a39","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Braz Teixeira","original_name":"Rodrigo Braz Teixeira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e8afeeb7d352005e207120","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Vieira","original_name":"André Vieira","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61004bbd568463007f1dc7c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3174934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filipe Cates","original_name":"Filipe Cates","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/w4r33i0EtWIBXNOIBkujZboGCkw.jpg","credit_id":"669f191d1dd010b55ddda19d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lEvtNU6xeNdTxtXd9ZHrGgih37j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1141}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
