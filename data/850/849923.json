By re-filming imagery from a 35mm theatrical print of a narrative feature, the frame is adapted and reframed, to present a very different kind of film by focussing solely on one single supporting character. The soundtrack of the original movie has been removed and replaced with an eerie soundscape and dialogue taken from an interview with the actor who appears in this footage. The title 'Sister Mary or Mary the Junkie' is based on a quotation spoken by the character in the original feature film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sLSftEV0ODgm0vweVZBytHHTpYC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sister Mary or Mary the Junkie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2607482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris O’Neill","original_name":"Chris O’Neill","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/aArLgiJ2aIQu438FSFYhcOxfJVK.jpg","credit_id":"60ec5d34903c52007d496b84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLSftEV0ODgm0vweVZBytHHTpYC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
