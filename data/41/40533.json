Tom, shipwrecked, washes up on a tropical island. His first attempts at food - a coconut and a turtle - are much too hard. But he spots Jerry just before Jerry sees him, and soon has him in the frying pan. Jerry escapes to a cannibal village; when he sees Tom's frightened reaction, he has his plan. Using soot from a pot, he blackens himself, then threatens Tom and starts cooking him. But Jerry's plan - and tail, and un-blackened bottom - is exposed when his grass skirt comes off during his war dance. Jerry helicopters away using the bone in his hair, and leading Tom right into the real cannibals. But Jerry's triumph is short-lived, as a pygmy cannibal comes after him.","popularity":0.8276,"poster_path":"/196n0EVCNAfc09KuXXkmGtlMk61.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Mouse Friday","video":false,"vote_average":6.308,"vote_count":39,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tom & Jerry: Ur grytan i elden","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"荒岛余生","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jerry / Cannibals (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4596c3a36847f80cf9d3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Barbera","original_name":"Joseph Barbera","popularity":1.2363,"profile_path":"/16UhnbVLaX9QBtcnjLH6hrdzq4F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4596c3a36847f80cf9bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":0.7365,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4596c3a36847f80cf9c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Bradley","original_name":"Scott Bradley","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/AjQ95xfBtFc39ADKaPi1jupim2m.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4596c3a36847f80cf9cf","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Quimby","original_name":"Fred Quimby","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4596c3a36847f80cf9c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Patterson","original_name":"Ray Patterson","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":"/przzcKQJDVMVhX9ovm7bnvSNkbf.jpg","credit_id":"66168a58c7a7e0017d069415","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149095,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Barge","original_name":"Ed Barge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66168a5fdc1cb401491b6b38","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149098,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Muse","original_name":"Kenneth Muse","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66168a46c7a7e0017d069401","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149100,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Irven Spence","original_name":"Irven Spence","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66168a4efac50201620b4cf0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0043644","wikidata_id":"Q5772162","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8y0A4HityR0lqUB5KxtSo8CnZHb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.641,"height":905,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/196n0EVCNAfc09KuXXkmGtlMk61.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n6YUHD0ahWL4ViqDordai8E3vrC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
