Miranda complains she wants something decent for her birthday like a fur coat...which Andy can't afford. A con man tells him he doesn't need money. He sells him a tracking hound and tells him he can hunt for the fox himself. Unfortunately, the fox Andy and his hound find has no intentions of being caught. Eventually, Andy does capture an animal to make a fur stole with. It's not the fox but, rather, something that's more of a surprise.","popularity":0.4828,"poster_path":"/9tVXpdMaqFn6IBJ4TZYSu9bBopw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scrappy Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe459ac3a36847f80d0459","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150768,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dick Lundy","original_name":"Dick Lundy","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/1ZOtBI746xrJErPiqUf2JFVUxu6.jpg","credit_id":"569436769251414b720002a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","credit_id":"569436d19251414b74000291","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117421,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heck Allen","original_name":"Heck Allen","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569436e89251414b780002a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932733,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laverne Harding","original_name":"Laverne Harding","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56943711c3a3680ea60002ac","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932735,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Les Kline","original_name":"Les Kline","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56943722c3a3680ea30002db","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0147381","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tVXpdMaqFn6IBJ4TZYSu9bBopw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/aXAnNZ1OfF19UDVcgRRvVhGgPd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
