On August 9, 1995, hard rock band Kiss performed on MTV Unplugged in what fans consider the beginning of the eventual Kiss Reunion Tour. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons contacted former members Peter Criss and Ace Frehley and invited them to participate in the event. Fan reaction to Criss and Frehley at the Unplugged show was so positive that, in 1996, the original lineup of Kiss reunited, with all four original members together for the first time since 1980. It also marked the only time the original lineup performed live without their trademark makeup, other than at Ace Frehley's wedding, and was also the only time Frehley and Criss shared a stage with Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick. Further, it was the first time Eric Singer had part of a lead vocal (shared with Peter Criss on Nothin' To Lose).","popularity":1.409,"poster_path":"/oS9KbXgN4eSMFc66ysplgvtuPy6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8136,"logo_path":"/zHS0wY1haJ3GOvkHFOf8Dfjkyt3.png","name":"MTV","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiss: Unplugged","video":true,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Simmons","original_name":"Gene Simmons","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/c1t3QgTO4XTDZZG5Ndjxjt8Jt0a.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53cfbb840e0a265dea00959e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Stanley","original_name":"Paul Stanley","popularity":0.4513,"profile_path":"/tcPAc5YiW5yjzlfqs8zwohAMaIp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53cfbb8a0e0a265dea0095a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Singer","original_name":"Eric Singer","popularity":0.2425,"profile_path":"/qYpCrJqkfI4cLxOg9MzHstPSlK2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53cfbb970e0a265e01009340","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Kulick","original_name":"Bruce Kulick","popularity":0.1905,"profile_path":"/JRgA9PDgWZIjFqLREsrbD0s0su.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b23e5f00e0a26562d000268","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ace Frehley","original_name":"Ace Frehley","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/j2GZwqT9sP8MyJBXFiQ5S9C9bol.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"53cfbbac0e0a265e01009343","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Criss","original_name":"Peter Criss","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/ysguTrAUiRrcRLteVNhdbSH0oMF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53cfbbb90e0a265de700970e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Perota","original_name":"Joe Perota","popularity":0.0565,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54456d89c3a3683e050081dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Coletti","original_name":"Alex Coletti","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54456e0a0e0a26633000842c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0737270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/etUvGpbitotMDconYUuCJ1Xd10Q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1408},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEi0c6PckaFG5aZJ9aZeF0kxeOL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oS9KbXgN4eSMFc66ysplgvtuPy6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":5540,"name":"heavy metal"},{"id":18002,"name":"hard rock"},{"id":191565,"name":"unplugged"},{"id":209937,"name":"acoustic"},{"id":211508,"name":"glam metal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
