Fortunately, there's a dish handy, but it's next to Tom. Nibbles scurries out and dives off Tom's nose, then grabs a whisker for balance, waking Tom up. Jerry grabs him just in time and they hide under the milk. Tom laps up some milk and gets Nibbles; Jerry rescues him, and they run for the hole. Next, they try a very long straw; Tom catches them and sucks Nibbles through the straw. Much chasing follows, with a pause now and then for some milk. Tom traps Jerry in a milk bottle and chases Nibbles a while; he finally corners Nibbles and spanks him with a flyswatter. Jerry is so enraged he burst out of the milk bottle and lets out a ferocious roar; he grabs Tom by the tail and thoroughly pummels him, then stands over him as Tom feeds Nibbles milk.","popularity":0.7323,"poster_path":"/qAAg4fS50Yn5ezysxOBtsUblflq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Milky Waif","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":45,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La forma láctea (El huérfano lácteo)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tom & Jerry: Mjölkjakten","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Randolph","original_name":"Lillian Randolph","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/k3dOsZunpup8wQcj1jKem9Oam8E.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jerry (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea8b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Quimby","original_name":"Fred Quimby","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Barbera","original_name":"Joseph Barbera","popularity":1.2363,"profile_path":"/16UhnbVLaX9QBtcnjLH6hrdzq4F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222516,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Michael Lah","original_name":"Michael Lah","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea6f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":0.7365,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149098,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Muse","original_name":"Kenneth Muse","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea75","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149095,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Barge","original_name":"Ed Barge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea7b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Bradley","original_name":"Scott Bradley","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/AjQ95xfBtFc39ADKaPi1jupim2m.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4591c3a36847f80cea69","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0038740","wikidata_id":"Q2667276","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9OFusYSg2jPlPXdDrSrbsFg0GNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qAAg4fS50Yn5ezysxOBtsUblflq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lvMyVPWLbObwkEuUHco4ZyW6luX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hGEUwhBXK0IH0gP3xSpOmLpKF9r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
