Unfortunately a case of mistaken identity puts Bob's father in charge, resulting in one disaster after another! Meanwhile, tales of Camelot inspire Bob's noble crew of machines - Sir Lift-A-Sot, Sir Roll-A-Lot and Lady Mix-A-Lot - in their quest to get the job done. And Sir Spud-A-Lot finds a suit of armor and a fiery steed almost perfect for jousting! Back at the castle, Bob's father is a bit of a royal pain, locking himself and Bob in the dungeon and then finding himself mysteriously trapped in a maze! Finally, a medieval pageant celebrates the grand opening of the castle and a great father-son relationship.","popularity":1.5668,"poster_path":"/fUEmEYqv5yHyivyb7P6E1gaOKXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28159,"logo_path":"/vi4Y2pr4P7Yk38EjEuEm59ebaaU.png","name":"HiT
