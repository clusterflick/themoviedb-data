She lives and works in an old house at the edge of the woods. The house is crowded with ghosts (including a priest, a bride, a mute child, some washed up vaudevillians and a noisy, sight-impaired group of musicians among others) that have been there for as long as she can remember. When a mysterious light appears in the woods the ghosts realize that they are trapped and begin to rebel. Zel is forced to come to terms with the origins of these spirits and letting go of the only family she has ever known.","popularity":0.3002,"poster_path":"/esITUonwyXLvQXkOE4npNQqJOuJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All My Friends Are Funeral Singers","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Bettis","original_name":"Angela Bettis","popularity":0.5499,"profile_path":"/4EntT31XmvVCKDI1XfWDEKlYgiq.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Zel","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0da9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Candini","original_name":"Emily Candini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Karen","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0dad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reid Coker","original_name":"Reid Coker","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Ted","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0db1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Ford","original_name":"Kevin Ford","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/cwaRXJhK35icPe5MXoYX43olFeD.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0db5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":86572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karol Kent","original_name":"Karol Kent","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/8k7TpYY6Ovf5GpxlRiY8yjtzj0V.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Camille","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0db9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Adamik","original_name":"Joe Adamik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Ghost Musician","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0dbd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Massarella","original_name":"Ben Massarella","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Ghost Musician","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0dc1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George McAuliffe","original_name":"George McAuliffe","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Julius","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0dc5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McGinley","original_name":"Michael McGinley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Bunuel","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0dc9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sierra Magdalena Mitchell","original_name":"Sierra Magdalena Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"Alice Marble Grey","credit_id":"52fe459cc3a36847f80d0dcd","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Rutili","original_name":"Tim Rutili","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b8d46a7cffda00406b863c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Rutili","original_name":"Tim Rutili","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b8d46fec8a430040bfa1d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1524148","wikidata_id":"Q4729099","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2168,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/esITUonwyXLvQXkOE4npNQqJOuJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
