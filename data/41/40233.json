While finding tenants has never been a problem for Tyler, keeping them alive long enough to pay rent is. No matter how nicely Tyler asks, he cannot keep the demons from eating the renters (or persuade them to wait a month or two, even). They never listen. And why should they? They have an all-you-can-eat buffet of delicious human flesh and Tyler as their pet monkey. But all that might change when Tyler takes a liking to the newest tenant, a desperate young woman running from demons of her own.","popularity":0.0957,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Landlord","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Amidei","original_name":"Brian Amidei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Gary","credit_id":"53ae8bc1c3a3682eea0033f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rom Barkhordar","original_name":"Rom Barkhordar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rabisu","credit_id":"53ae8bd1c3a3682edf003108","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayson Bernard","original_name":"Jayson Bernard","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/iYi0uG53IL3AkbYFndbrqODeqSX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"QVC Host","credit_id":"53ae8be8c3a3682eea0033fc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brion Bliss","original_name":"Brion Bliss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Reggie","credit_id":"53ae8bf7c3a3682ed800322b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezekiel Brown","original_name":"Ezekiel Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Det.
