Sounds simple enough; get the money, save her life. But her underpaid, working class husband can't afford the treatment. And time is ticking away. As Sydney begins to seek out a means to save her life, she begins to question her existence and does some soul searching, only to find herself falling in love with a single mom in the neighborhood that Sydney and her family have just moved into. Sydney is then forced to choose between her religious upbringing, her husband and son, and a love that she hides, all while fighting a losing battle to save her own life.","popularity":0.1785,"poster_path":"/kQCPQIlkOSz2z2WAv5GCfyOd3Ph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running on Empty Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Benner","original_name":"Kathleen Benner","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/gAQ7hMVb7ADREEQp532hdIfBuGu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sydney Harris","credit_id":"566818e2c3a36836af0028f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Owens","original_name":"Rachel Owens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jane Smith","credit_id":"5a327c009251415475015e13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":467271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Rosete","original_name":"Jose Rosete","popularity":0.4912,"profile_path":"/7txBc8cYN5babjetfR9Q2Adz8XE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Corey Harris","credit_id":"5a327c170e0a264cbc1a5e93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wil Rillero","original_name":"Wil Rillero","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Matt Harris","credit_id":"5a327c2e0e0a264cbe199b5f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nitara Lee Osbourne","original_name":"Nitara Lee Osbourne","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a327c5b0e0a264ccd1a2961","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nitara Lee Osbourne","original_name":"Nitara Lee Osbourne","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a327c470e0a264cca19a5a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1090679","wikidata_id":"Q4198256","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQCPQIlkOSz2z2WAv5GCfyOd3Ph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
