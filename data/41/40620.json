Narrated by Academy Award winning actress Nicole Kidman, it features interviews with longtime Wiesenthal associates, government leaders from around the world, friends and family members--many of whom have never discussed the legendary Nazi hunter and humanitarian on camera. Previously unseen archival film and photos also highlight the film. What was the driving force behind his work? What kept him going when for years the odds were against his efforts? What is his legacy today, more than 60 years after the end of World War Two?","popularity":1.4128,"poster_path":"/glxchpIupx0c8ZoofM4n0H3nw8a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moriah Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Have Never Forgotten You: The Life & Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Kidman","original_name":"Nicole Kidman","popularity":6.9467,"profile_path":"/lfW2cDigTcvuoe4k6UfCdGVE1R6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe459ac3a36847f80d0575","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Wiesenthal","original_name":"Simon Wiesenthal","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/4h4X8ybl6cDtKXu15Zgcq1mWMu8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe459ac3a36847f80d0579","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Kingsley","original_name":"Ben Kingsley","popularity":3.4493,"profile_path":"/vQtBqpF2HDdzbfXHDzR4u37i1Ac.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7eadbfd861af00377cb5b0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Trank","original_name":"Richard Trank","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe459ac3a36847f80d0571","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084996,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeff Victor","original_name":"Jeff Victor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f352a4ac8e6b00a7b03313","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084995,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marvin Hier","original_name":"Marvin Hier","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f35270c3926600ffa641e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554372,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carey Ann Strelecki","original_name":"Carey Ann Strelecki","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f352dcc39266009f7f74f1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Trank","original_name":"Richard Trank","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f3527d4fd1410046c619ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265842,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Inbal B.
