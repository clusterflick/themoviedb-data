Lewis' acclaimed series, \"The Chronicles of Narnia.\" Four children pass through a mystic portal in a wardrobe and discover the magical kingdom of Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures. There, an evil witch's spell has cast the land into eternal winter. Fearing that an ancient prophecy is coming to fruition, and that the children are Narnia's rightful rulers, the White Witch tricks their youngest brother into betraying his family, enacting an ancient magic that she can use to halt the fulfillment of the prophecy. Now, only Aslan, noble lion and High King above all kings in Narnia, can help them defeat the witch, restore springtime to Narnia, and claim their rightful places on the throne.","popularity":1.3621,"poster_path":"/5ebzw3VOkceR4gq9w3ZQ5nptOS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5061,"logo_path":"/7snDCNoCC1pMNqPYCC6pvKVk19b.png","name":"Children's Television Workshop","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Melendez Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15255,"logo_path":null,"name":"TVC London","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":156735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pegbar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":156736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Episcopal Radio-TV Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":207116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Distinguished Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":51,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Narnia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The First Book of the Chronicles of Narnia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Narnia - Løven, Heksen og Garderobeskabet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe","type":"onscreen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Warren","original_name":"Rachel Warren","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Lucy (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a2534544af0074fb7c11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Sokol","original_name":"Susan Sokol","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Susan (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a267fbe36f002d52f2cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reg Williams","original_name":"Reg Williams","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Peter (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a28127ff99005df5b81f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":26859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Adams","original_name":"Simon Adams","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Edmund (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a2a2945d360046fb0e01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Spinetti","original_name":"Victor Spinetti","popularity":0.2158,"profile_path":"/bcanHW2duY9o0k724FhYa4D4a6h.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Mr. Tumnus (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a2d3344a8e00479e6259","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Vosburgh","original_name":"Dick Vosburgh","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Professor (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a31d4ca676002ddcb983","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Parker","original_name":"Don Parker","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Mr. Beaver (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a36cbdd568007ea3c7ca","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Proud","original_name":"Liz Proud","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Mrs. Beaver (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a383344a8e00287d7d43","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Thorne","original_name":"Stephen Thorne","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Aslan (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a3e9b686b90075f97226","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1228933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Porter","original_name":"Beth Porter","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Witch (voice)","credit_id":"60e0a472b686b9002d62214d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1217352,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David D.
