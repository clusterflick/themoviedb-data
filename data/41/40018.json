The movie is unsparing in its treatment of the Corps, and Carde clearly views it as her own personal mission to hold that organization accountable for the many acts of criminal malfeasance it has engaged in over the years.","popularity":0.358,"poster_path":"/AvPI9aN8QJrur4MND2tGbeUiN7o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Betrayed","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dreyfuss","original_name":"Richard Dreyfuss","popularity":1.35,"profile_path":"/q2BPu6zWwFtnzQfpl4fgbKqURXM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55f1647bc3a36822fe00180f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bea","original_name":"Robert Bea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55f1649ac3a36822f50019b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey DiFatta","original_name":"Joey DiFatta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55f164b49251416711001870","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Ellis","original_name":"Steve Ellis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55f164ca9251416705001857","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Franz","original_name":"Lucille Franz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"55f164dd925141670d001863","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Hedge-Morrell","original_name":"Cynthia Hedge-Morrell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"55f164f3925141670700187d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Hoffmeister","original_name":"Judy Hoffmeister","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"55f16508c3a36823030018c1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3063360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Landrieu","original_name":"Mary Landrieu","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/18pgcnRYTPidEwYqgdCFSP2oYnp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d2e0f362e86f01d6826048","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie Carde","original_name":"Leslie Carde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f163c1c3a36822ef001668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie Carde","original_name":"Leslie Carde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55f1645d92514145300002bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1268175","wikidata_id":"Q59725606","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AvPI9aN8QJrur4MND2tGbeUiN7o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
