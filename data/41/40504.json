It was released in DVD and VHS formats. The DVD features concert footage, band interviews, a documentary, behind the scenes footage and a photo gallery consisting of approximately 1,000 photos. Three of the performances feature multiple angles. During the performance of the song 'Enter Sandman', the entire stage is set to appear to collapse and explode, with pyrotechnics and a technician (referred to in the extras as the 'Burning Dude') who runs across the stage while on fire, as another technician swings overhead. This is also one of the only Metallica concerts that didn't feature 'Ecstasy of Gold' as an intro.","popularity":1.0671,"poster_path":"/qSzpgh7PhjDFz1Eg3oOgrqG7W8I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59,"logo_path":"/b1tj5EWcFQLYaQrw1D9V4s8kUgN.png","name":"A Band Apart","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metallica: Cunning Stunts","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Metallica - Cunning Stunts","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hetfield","original_name":"James Hetfield","popularity":0.4702,"profile_path":"/1DBDpjWorXCwvMQLZeDIGfDQ5sJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Ulrich","original_name":"Lars Ulrich","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/uMcUqvbViiHftEpz0u4AxAnCgF3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirk Hammett","original_name":"Kirk Hammett","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/wMsYlpaoALVgtOColQ9Fl68mx0u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Newsted","original_name":"Jason Newsted","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/qn1fzD9nBgDvyDnr96BxOSP8NUm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4e3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Isham","original_name":"Wayne Isham","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945705,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joey Plewa","original_name":"Joey Plewa","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/tZAUtBeIhHTenET7COh6I1j1joy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084875,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kevin Childress","original_name":"Kevin Childress","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf507","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dana Marshall","original_name":"Dana Marshall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":964477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Hausen","original_name":"David Hausen","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4595c3a36847f80cf4fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6042,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Pearl","original_name":"Daniel Pearl","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/vagPGNGMKvUJVVEGIXwr5s6drFg.jpg","credit_id":"5402d0890e0a2658f10069f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3719398,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mark Fisher","original_name":"Mark Fisher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64205fa123be4600a122e0b7","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0180826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/inqfNvjnSzQE1XuIjFClncyjSzW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qSzpgh7PhjDFz1Eg3oOgrqG7W8I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prime Video","release_date":"2022-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
