What explains this explosion of living creatures—1.4 million different species discovered so far, with perhaps another 50 million to go? The source of life's endless forms was a profound mystery until Charles Darwin brought forth his revolutionary idea of natural selection. But Darwin's radical insights raised as many questions as they answered. What actually drives evolution and turns one species into another? To what degree do different animals rely on the same genetic toolkit? And how did we evolve?","popularity":2.7633,"poster_path":"/dGjviW1eCMy9OKfWRc3GPREgCL6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6773,"logo_path":"/thh8BxybjvOoI618djeXzwhGfh4.png","name":"NOVA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One hundred and fifty years later, scientists decode nature's greatest mysteries","title":"What Darwin Never Knew","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Co Darwin nemohl vědět","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"达尔文所不知道的事","type":"记录片"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Steudel","original_name":"Karl Steudel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8eouVaopwsL5OZzxvKxfWszPgXl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4abd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Chu","original_name":"Jerry Chu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4ac1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kandace Cummings","original_name":"Kandace Cummings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4ac5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Becker Gray","original_name":"Ellen Becker Gray","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/A4YbiddpNraHJJZHiXpv8bgzcd7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4ac9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rushmore DeNooyer","original_name":"Rushmore DeNooyer","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/57lLQqPYHpJmuANpTCWUi0pVOTX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4aad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serena Davies","original_name":"Serena Davies","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Holt","original_name":"Sarah Holt","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4ab9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":209959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rubin","original_name":"John Rubin","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45aec3a36847f80d4aa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1540263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQ8dtCzmD1aZxeqMFbi82bedVxt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dGjviW1eCMy9OKfWRc3GPREgCL6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6017,"name":"genetics"},{"id":6016,"name":"biology"},{"id":1718,"name":"dna"},{"id":5647,"name":"natural history"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":34152,"name":"evolution"},{"id":161204,"name":"natural selection"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
