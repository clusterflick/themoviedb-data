Being kind of a cheapskate, he hides his dog in the closet from Wally's presence but, upon entering Andy's house, Wally still suspects something is amiss. He uses a trained flea to reveal the dog who gets chased by Wally into a pond in the backyard. After \"fishing\" the dog out, Wally demands Andy pay his $3.00 but both are in for a surprise: the dog has an entire litter of puppies each worth an additional $3.00!","popularity":0.1279,"poster_path":"/1i01Dfl5YZ2Vaz5t6VMaj9MtLo0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog Tax Dodgers","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150768,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dick Lundy","original_name":"Dick Lundy","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/1ZOtBI746xrJErPiqUf2JFVUxu6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4596c3a36847f80cf803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932733,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laverne Harding","original_name":"Laverne Harding","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634287e55b4fed007ae70766","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darrell Calker","original_name":"Darrell Calker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634287ef1b7c59007e6d96a1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932838,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Pat Matthews","original_name":"Pat Matthews","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634287fbb18f3200797e2d08","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","credit_id":"569437bec3a3680ea8000312","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344144,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alfons Heck","original_name":"Alfons Heck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569437f6c3a3680e9d0002d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1i01Dfl5YZ2Vaz5t6VMaj9MtLo0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8tQAZjRhCSPqSKO8vCUGfTTUvPj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
