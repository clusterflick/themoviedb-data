To lead their battle, they resort to a law dating back to the origin of the American Constitution - The Alien Tort Claims Act - which allows foreigners to file suit in the U.S. against Americans who violate international laws. The film tells the story of their fight against one of America's stellar icons: the Coca-Cola company.","popularity":0.1318,"poster_path":"/vqXB9izpiIJqqKu85bCyJHJp4Gt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":33059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argus Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Coca-Cola Case","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Caso Coca-Cola","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Garcia","original_name":"Carmen Garcia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1hvH2ZlW5gROOGa2ebu5t8w1nNK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe458ec3a36847f80cdf73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929631,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"German Gutierrez","original_name":"German Gutierrez","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe458ec3a36847f80cdf79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1339641","wikidata_id":"Q59588909","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vcEMksRnFQl1tAp4DzYCKpHv7t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.931,"height":173,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jhRczdUAYyphtaRyFPM3IgwHNei.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/hKqgx2wUndAyc2RCvkNfl76Mi80.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/oieYKubikBV9ztVl69X4pbTNH0Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vqXB9izpiIJqqKu85bCyJHJp4Gt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE COCA-COLA CASE - TRAILER","key":"220132457","site":"Vimeo","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-06-03T16:08:17.000Z","id":"5d47cab62d1e400199be841a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE COCA-COLA CASE - TRAILER","key":"wUb-PAnflqo","published_at":"2009-04-07T17:37:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec69cc3a3685448004ab1"}]}}}
