It features Goro Miyazaki speaking with Isao Takahata about the \"charm\" of the museum and its various influences. Goro tours the viewer around the museum, explaining the intricate details that his father, Hayao Miyazaki made during its construction.  The documentary highlights the strong European influences in the museum's architecture, featuring footage of the medieval mountainous city of Calcata in Italy and the historic port city of Genoa, which Miyazaki had visited in the past. These trips would go on to influencing the imagery seen in Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, and Spirited Away.","popularity":0.5353,"poster_path":"/aNUhdvaxEJd1JcwhYSz8pyrDmMS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10342,"logo_path":"/uFuxPEZRUcBTEiYIxjHJq62Vr77.png","name":"Studio Ghibli","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hayao Miyazaki and the Ghibli Museum","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Miyazaki Hayao to Jiburi Bijutsukan","type":"Roumaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Miyazaki Hayao to bijyutsukan","type":"Rōmaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Takahata","original_name":"高畑勲","popularity":0.8716,"profile_path":"/xTkZOWe1VU4xNba1lO0T9trFLHm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e6e2e1c3a3684a7903a1c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hayao Miyazaki","original_name":"宮崎駿","popularity":2.0537,"profile_path":"/ouhjt9KugzhWtdEyBPipihB3ic8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e6e2fcc3a3684a7903a1df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshio Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木敏夫","popularity":0.5891,"profile_path":"/h8KzdSl5kIHgXputSBhxDZ1CA1g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed5469d8ddc340021d8018a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Goro Miyazaki","original_name":"宮崎吾朗","popularity":0.5243,"profile_path":"/9NapAMlmo6weZKW56KfkgzXrQZt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed546e3e4b576001e312032","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuri Norstein","original_name":"Юрий Норштейн","popularity":0.236,"profile_path":"/jXZxyCwla3vfHs1nS6w5EZz8oi1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed5470221c4ca001fe0f571","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Lasseter","original_name":"John Lasseter","popularity":0.7991,"profile_path":"/7EdqiNbr4FRjIhKHyPPdFfEEEFG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed5472afea0d7001e8b67e0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Junichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤順一","popularity":0.5547,"profile_path":"/ckKxvO5rmHG9nh4ZarKffR3iYUv.jpg","credit_id":"60e1cbe48805510045cc74df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Goro Miyazaki","original_name":"宮崎吾朗","popularity":0.5243,"profile_path":"/9NapAMlmo6weZKW56KfkgzXrQZt.jpg","credit_id":"5ed54846a284eb00213881cb","department":"Editing","job":"Project Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662235,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshikazu Satou","original_name":"Toshikazu Satou","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed54c345c071b001d2ccff0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sJQoDPto3AdRHouOdnfumi8ppXH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mrTz8qKqLedkHALdap0xmk27ifx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gbN1F2d0f6vmWJe6wnltpLb7URR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1472},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQ7xHzS3LWAqlCwLn3Q5YRnP9Dj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/5Hhce0SeZfX64313GlJXNH6Iunf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1317,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/aNUhdvaxEJd1JcwhYSz8pyrDmMS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":878}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
