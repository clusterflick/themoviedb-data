He selects Linus as his pit crew and goes to a store to select a bike, and due to insufficient funds, he must settle for a tiny, run-down putt-putt. The majority of Charlie's opponents are eliminated in the race, and Charlie, wearing a makeshift helmet carved from a pumpkin, finds himself in close competition with his friend, tomboy Peppermint Patty, and the Masked Marvel (a.k.a. Snoopy, Charlie's dog).","popularity":0.5511,"poster_path":"/wSi3Xh3daiKU0jYPrdansdoOEZF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lee Mendelson Film Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Melendez Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":52263,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Feature Syndicate","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charles M.
