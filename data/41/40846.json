Some bad guys rob a stagecoach; one of the passengers is Alice, who finds herself stuck between the head bad guy and a cactus. Julius rides in and saves most of the passengers, but the bad guy rides off with Alice. After a short chase, he ends up battling Julius on top of a tall rock outcropping. A piece eventually breaks off, sending both of them into a boulder field. They play hide-and-seek a while. Julius then takes off his fur and sends it out as a decoy while he sneaks up behind the bad guy with a club and beats him into the ground. Alice comes up to thank him; ashamed by his nakedness, he hides behind a rock and puts his fur back on, then accepts her thanks.","popularity":0.4516,"poster_path":"/65STh3fD3nhhQi8iaWFFi3MS5rl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walt Disney Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice in the Wooly West","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margie Gay","original_name":"Margie Gay","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alice (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e0896399bcd0f001a13b075","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe45a7c3a36847f80d2edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144555,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret J.
