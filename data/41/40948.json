At the beginning of a fateful summer, he has a chance encounter with a friend who tells Tommie that he's headed to Provincetown, on the Cape, for a long weekend. Tommie is inspired to make his own trek to P-town, where he goes on a summer long, balls-out quest for Mr. Right, even though he has no money and holds his breath each time he uses his American Express card. In the course of the summer, Tommie looks for a work as a house boy at various inns, works several jobs, benefits from the kindness of a stranger, and gets involved with a series of men.
