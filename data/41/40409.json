What is very different here is the presentation of the material. Backed up by a lush orchestra (the Petrobrás Pró Música Orchestra), some of Gal's old hits have a beautiful new sound. Even some of her early songs, such as \"Baby\" and \"Não Identificado,\" are more subdued. As a whole, the CD does show a more mature and secure performer. As added bonuses, Gal invites a few guests to sing with her. Having introduced Luiz Melodia to Brazil, Gal brings him back in \"Pérola Negra,\" one great moment in the CD. Continuing the list of guests, Gal then introduces a new name in 1997: Zeca Baleiro. Their duet in \"A Flor da Pele\" is hauntingly beautiful and the most beautiful track in Acústico MTV. Targeting the younger MTV crowd, two names from Brazilian rock lend their voices in two additional duets.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/iDlCU2tP0lDRT4d01UZKa9t4hHN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127657,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTV Brasil","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1997-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acústico MTV: Gal Costa","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Acustico MTV - Gal Costa.ISO","type":"DVD"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Acústico MTV - Gal Costa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1137435","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/iDlCU2tP0lDRT4d01UZKa9t4hHN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/79u5LuqQ5uQC1tTCnmxpzXz67wr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":624}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
