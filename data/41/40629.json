The result, complete with a chorus of gentlemen of Japan as cartoon-like British peers, emphatically underscores the Englishness of the satire. The occasional non sequiturs, like a bunch of gentry dressed for Ascot and singing in Japanese, are loonily fun, and no more absurd than the fantasyland Japan that Gilbert and Sullivan invented. The time frame, though, seems little more than an excuse for a smart black-and-white production design.","popularity":0.514,"poster_path":"/6WX4RZuWHNN9Fo0brjxx3VBXtS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/h9O2O30eqiYaNi8qRKclV2U4Wjw.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8376,"logo_path":null,"name":"A&E Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":184636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fremantle Media Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Operetta, Musical","title":"The Mikado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Idle","original_name":"Eric Idle","popularity":0.6696,"profile_path":"/1Vj7Lvrl8OHby7AeOK1Z07JyeMp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ko-Ko","credit_id":"52fe459ac3a36847f80d077d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1025603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lesley Garrett","original_name":"Lesley Garrett","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/1uUAiqtJFz6RQnPN2SIVgC1IDAh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yum-Yum","credit_id":"6029394092e55b003f5d7ef4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonaventura Bottone","original_name":"Bonaventura Bottone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nanki-Poo","credit_id":"60293950c7176d003fd61690","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Van Allan","original_name":"Richard Van Allan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pooh-Bah","credit_id":"6029395f7e403d00403e0528","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felicity Palmer","original_name":"Felicity Palmer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vmSzkVNnYe5HqCvQycHXHMLYE0H.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Katisha","credit_id":"602939756ee3d7003ee1af11","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Angas","original_name":"Richard Angas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Mikado of Japan","credit_id":"60293984417aaf0041087017","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Bullock","original_name":"Susan Bullock","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Peep-Bo","credit_id":"602939923396b9003bf35163","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethna Robinson","original_name":"Ethna Robinson","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pitti-Sing","credit_id":"602939a03a48c500400db6e9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Richardson","original_name":"Mark Richardson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Pish-Tush","credit_id":"602939c6a6725400416a27cf","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Robinson","original_name":"Peter Robinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6375361ac3514c00753009a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Miller","original_name":"Jonathan Miller","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/jBhQSQavORk3DZzn5mDMgtxWjW3.jpg","credit_id":"64494a9005a53304e81b7613","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Michael Phillips","original_name":"John Michael Phillips","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60293a7028723c003fd2900f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Miller","original_name":"Jonathan Miller","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/jBhQSQavORk3DZzn5mDMgtxWjW3.jpg","credit_id":"60293a6392e55b003d5df741","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arthur Sullivan","original_name":"Arthur Sullivan","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60293a033a48c5003e0d3a1c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.S.
