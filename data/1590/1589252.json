What begins as an act of rebellion turns into a dark metamorphosis: under the harassment of her fanatical mother, the young woman confuses the real with the forbidden and, in her attempt to escape, undergoes a bodily ritual where she discovers that Liliana could be just the incarnate reflection of her own desire. The final liberation does not save her: it transforms her.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4ymaUoUQaP0qrX9bHFJiCuH9COh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":265407,"logo_path":null,"name":"MER","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true sin is awakening","title":"Hagiofobia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Hagiophobia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1317111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Dinamarca","original_name":"Paula Dinamarca","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6RLPhQ3SqNgtR4JeiWnEtSAS2MK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Génesis","credit_id":"6929be7b222e5a1e2e371fdc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5507494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahiara Sáenz Piña","original_name":"Mahiara Sáenz Piña","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929bea1529ddef13426c8f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5507494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahiara Sáenz Piña","original_name":"Mahiara Sáenz Piña","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929bebae0c4caff91a761d5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5507494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahiara Sáenz Piña","original_name":"Mahiara Sáenz Piña","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929beda424deecd3226c95b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenstory"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5507498,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriel Caldera","original_name":"Gabriel Caldera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929bf664a9cac5d21245fa8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5507499,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Susan Méndez","original_name":"Susan Méndez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929bf947f3ee4609126c951","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2806,"iso_3166_1":"MX","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4ymaUoUQaP0qrX9bHFJiCuH9COh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
