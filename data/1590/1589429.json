Eine türkische Frauengruppe in Hamburg","overview":"The numerous television programmes in which Gisela Tuchtenhagen participated (some of which cannot currently be shown for legal reasons) are mostly united by their feminist theme. The NDR programme WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEM? provides insight into the work of a Turkish women's group at the second Hamburg Women's Week, a political education programme organised by the Hamburg University of Economics and Politics under the motto \"Women learning together\". The programme, the first to be produced by an all-female television team, impressively documents the suspicion and Islamophobic clichés faced by women of Turkish origin in the West German women's movement, attempting to break down prejudices and fight discrimination.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Was wissen wir schon von denen?
