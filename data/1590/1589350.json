Raw Opium travels the world to profile diverse players in the opium game: an opium master in southeast Asia, a UN drug enforcement officer on the Afghan border, a former Indian government Drug Czar, and two people who confront the reality of drug addiction on a daily basis: a Portuguese street worker and a crusading Vancouver doctor. The film reveals how a beautiful flower plays a pivotal role – not just in the lives of those who grow, manufacture and use it – but also in the increasingly tense sphere of international relations. In the process, Raw Opium challenges assumptions about addiction and the War on Drugs.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kensington Communications","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pain Pleasure Profits","title":"Raw Opium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ralston","original_name":"John Ralston","popularity":0.4082,"profile_path":"/f89otIIkQaqeB1oEoN0l7XWp26n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"6929eca4d8a34bb1fe371ce7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5845094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misha Glenny","original_name":"Misha Glenny","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/uMKlJCtNQbpnl8CraUUpCmQ2bG9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"692a338378246dc12d81f91f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabor Maté","original_name":"Gabor Maté","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/vIvaPsc760TyZ7IWXR9XhaUn9SR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"692a33b4a2b6ba7eee4df1be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gwynne Dyer","original_name":"Gwynne Dyer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1QDDOgbkPPkkxXW2NirUtaduK8A.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"692a348c142e7b35db6cf2ca","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Findlay","original_name":"Peter Findlay","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929ecc5632305690c246094","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929ed36181196092f3721d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929ed591d95530dd5a74f81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Findlay","original_name":"Peter Findlay","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929ed686a65040263c12c37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Fuller","original_name":"Michael Fuller","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929edbcbf582735d226c07e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1870507","wikidata_id":"Q7296882","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rmSvSFehKnBhUVRJTLr1y7nmWZb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Raw Opium Documentary - Official Trailer","key":"rvjxZdVurJQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-11-29T20:51:50.000Z","id":"6929eb5c3999b7ac5330db21"}]}}}
