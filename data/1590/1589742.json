In 2006, we filmed the ‘cousins from Primeiro de Maio’ being received by Queen Mother Isabel, and almost twenty years later, we resumed filming with her daughter—now the queen—who receives the same folia, the same songs, and the same gifts. A visit that is then returned to Estrela’s headquarters, accompanied by the film’s crew.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Estrela do Oriente Visita o Reino Treze de Maio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2492570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Cassimiro","original_name":"Isabel Cassimiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0beb99c8a479f481fbd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2492568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Júnia Torres","original_name":"Junia Torres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0bfd89169fb0513ce710","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313294,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bernard Machado","original_name":"Bernard Machado","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0c13a15454a82db8f0be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5846043,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Ribeiro Duarte","original_name":"Daniel Ribeiro Duarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0c2459d392e30e6cf5f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286734,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Vasconcelos","original_name":"Bruno Vasconcelos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0c3c0fa8e0e19f08082e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2492568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Júnia Torres","original_name":"Junia Torres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0c4b9ac3656abd4c4357","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
