The task was the redesign of the Hamburg Elbe bank. The face of the city was to be moved from the Alster to the Elbe. In addition to Berlin, Linz, Nuremberg and Munich, the Hanseatic city was thus declared a \"Führerstadt\". Representation and administrative buildings for the party and the private economy were to be created. The architects involved in the project are interviewed. They reflect their activity and function at that time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/djYmx4jOUKvClALsgvLsOejyQZo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200799,"logo_path":null,"name":"die thede","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das neue Hamburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1762413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Bau","original_name":"Christian Bau","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b4820dd17cc64c84df5b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4653888,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manfred Oppermann","original_name":"Manfred Oppermann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b48398bdbd5f82c81fd18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_3166_1":"DE","iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/djYmx4jOUKvClALsgvLsOejyQZo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
