The rich musical collection, collected throughout their lives, is the legacy that the Dutch couple plans to pass on to someone in Macedonia. For years, they have been living with the dilemma of whether there is an appropriate institution to take care of this heritage, given that historical archives are not properly preserved and some are lost forever. The film follows one family's struggle to preserve a part of Macedonian history.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/btqtkqrZBC8XQwP7DRx7OwXK3zp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkcija Vidi Vaka","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scratches of the Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4604934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandar Manasiev","original_name":"Aleksandar Manasiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929faa74a9cac5d21246068","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5844838,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Siniša Ilijeski","original_name":"Siniša Ilijeski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929fac07f3ee4609126ca4a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5844838,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Siniša Ilijeski","original_name":"Siniša Ilijeski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929fad9c699acb1d72496c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5844840,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandar Dimitrioski","original_name":"Aleksandar Dimitrioski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929faefc9c5d096c02468b3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5844843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mite Kuzevski","original_name":"Mite Kuzevski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929fb13451e7c2b8ec12e4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5844844,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Goran Igikj","original_name":"Goran Igikj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6929fb2428ff7986ca30db7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/btqtkqrZBC8XQwP7DRx7OwXK3zp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
