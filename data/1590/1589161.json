Meanwhile, cow thieves are plaguing Marcos Valverde and his daughter Elicia; and Leon Serrano, the local deputy sheriff (actually the leader of the rustlers), realizing the community will demand a victim, arrests Carlson, who has innocently bought a stolen horse from the thieves. Draper rescues him from a lynching party and learns the whereabouts of the rustlers. Leon Serrano is unmasked as the culprit and then is arrested by Draper, who gives his reward to Carlson and is himself rewarded by the love of Elicia.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gRzG1VH8Of5tuowmhQYEd0KtsaH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Western Pictures Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tracks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Patton","original_name":"Bill Patton","popularity":0.7141,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Norman Draper","credit_id":"69298ab51f4acf267f372166","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Berrell","original_name":"George Berrell","popularity":0.2684,"profile_path":"/qTaiMJQ8BJrZPAPSAJA6GkoLzMh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Phillip Carlson","credit_id":"69298ac6f27adf435ad9d478","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5775517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Dumas","original_name":"François Dumas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marcos Valverde","credit_id":"69298ae8159e8c918226c72b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Burnham","original_name":"Beatrice Burnham","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/k3dr8XFYimxyFYXSYyUGNnuIUgA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elicia","credit_id":"69298aff6442f52e30245e64","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noble Johnson","original_name":"Noble Johnson","popularity":0.3724,"profile_path":"/ktN2dIxPBTdt7RqpFoWD0upCbUp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Leon Serrano","credit_id":"69298b10f27adf435ad9d488","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
