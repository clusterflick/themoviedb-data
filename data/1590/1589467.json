The family maid notices the pair's affectionate behavior toward each other and, aghast, reports the incident to Maida's father, the head of the local Purity League. The local citizenry is so outraged by this scandalous behavior that they force Maida to leave town. Meanwhile, Harold Brown, her late husband's brother, is aware that the family estate will revert to him if Maida remarries, so he spies on her in order to prove that she and Louis are married, so Harold can get the family fortune for himself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uUeS6TkNxXBthqxVWuaVefDtWuA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Appearance of Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Elvidge","original_name":"June Elvidge","popularity":0.3764,"profile_path":"/fbcSD4gt790qR0CBpsqqL4EkqfP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maida Brown","credit_id":"692a3d419be827a9934c3fc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Mayo","original_name":"Frank Mayo","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/mQrCpMdK3THFcD68WcRdE9vBgiH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Louis Letchworth","credit_id":"692a3d50540f71f44edf7298","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3561163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Redmond","original_name":"Douglas Redmond","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gordon Brown","credit_id":"692a3d62725500512c4df1a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Clement","original_name":"Clay Clement","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/IE33z6hzwKvwjdpmiHvRSU7Mbr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charlie Royce","credit_id":"692a3d72001b28e73381f8f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":952657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George MacQuarrie","original_name":"George MacQuarrie","popularity":0.8305,"profile_path":"/9eGUVUBTQLA6e3uT0YmZQ72hPbT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harold Brown","credit_id":"692a3d832a6cd76fb467636a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":981098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Cecil","original_name":"Nora Cecil","popularity":0.3155,"profile_path":"/cQa0cwlxAdqwU52dw05gpJB3RSH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Miss Spurgeon","credit_id":"692a3d929af8f05bba6cf2ff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2919084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inez Ranous","original_name":"Inez Ranous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Elsie Quimby","credit_id":"692a3da8540f71f44edf729c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis R.
