We see a German housewife doing the washing the traditional way – i.e. putting it out to bleach on the grass. Unfortunately, some hens walk all over it. All that work for nothing! So the sun, who has observed all these goings-on, recommends \"Famos\" as a bleaching agent.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Katastrophe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5846027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leni Fischer","original_name":"Leni Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b0af301ffeccf6081fce3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
