The experimental activities were led by a group from FilmCentrum and Teckningslärarinstitutet. At first, they made films that they themselves would most like to make – e.g. a trick film with Donald Duck, a horror film, etc. They also filmed the environment in the City and each other in a “documentary” way. Then they tried to create “neutral” material – images of cars, etc. that they filmed in the City without any particular intention. They divided themselves into two groups – one each against motoring and traffic in the city.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalle Anka - skräck och bilism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3741152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefania Lopez Svenstedt","original_name":"Stefania Lopez Svenstedt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b4a4b59d392e30e6cf71a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingela Romare","original_name":"Ingela Romare","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mOEaNZ6uzdjB0Bru03t0nYh5jMb.jpg","credit_id":"692b4a547bf2c594e44c42e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1017239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lennart Malmer","original_name":"Lennart Malmer","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692b4a5e885ee6546b6cf6eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
