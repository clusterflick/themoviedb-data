After that tragedy, some members of the faculty and student body of Kent State put together a motion picture which documents this confrontation. The filmmakers interviewed the people in the town of Kent, students, and faculty of the university, and a member of the National Guard . . . And they asked all these people the question “Do you think that the shooting of the students at Kent was justified?” The answers they received form the content of the film . . . and these answers raise disturbing questions about the nature of our society.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confrontation at Kent State","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Myers","original_name":"Richard Myers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/eXAddiigOnY8J7rPDu8R9ydtVQx.jpg","credit_id":"692b2601761b9d4a544df539","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
