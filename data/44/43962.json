His boast that he could easily smuggle rubber, a key wartime natural resource, out of Malaya has him tasked with doing just that. He manages to get someone from his past, Carnaghan, sprung from Alactraz and together they head off to South East Asia posing as Irishmen. Once there, Carnaghan lines up some of his old cronies and with Royer and a few plantation owners plans to smuggle the rubber out from under the Japanese army's watchful eye.","popularity":1.5938,"poster_path":"/ux3vUiB4lXhDhQq5AuPnMyjDkLM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you kiss a girl in Malaya...keep your eyes wide open and a gun in your hand!","title":"Malaya","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Malaca","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"East of the Rising Sun","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Tracy","original_name":"Spencer Tracy","popularity":0.5472,"profile_path":"/aUZUlQjiWvl23stKXzxycb31sen.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carnaghan","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fe9dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Stewart","original_name":"James Stewart","popularity":1.6611,"profile_path":"/jam9DRhOuKomlr0vUXTamPoxPdk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Royer","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fe9e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Cortese","original_name":"Valentina Cortese","popularity":0.5168,"profile_path":"/zk2upnCba1NBo3ueIKykcYQ1Gzk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Luana","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fe9f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Greenstreet","original_name":"Sydney Greenstreet","popularity":0.2454,"profile_path":"/67bcDUjZEXrTpOTejsweP53KQGV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Dutchman","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fe9f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hodiak","original_name":"John Hodiak","popularity":0.4359,"profile_path":"/mID9LQsHzbb3u9tMOs7DeTEsNjj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Kellar","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fe9f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"John Manchester","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fe9fd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Roland","original_name":"Gilbert Roland","popularity":0.7805,"profile_path":"/mzFPFiCb7fNsGI9gBFHYn0kqg7g.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Romano","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fea01","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Winters","original_name":"Roland Winters","popularity":0.3118,"profile_path":"/3dZQ2NzZwvgOVODs3WxmqrtfWU3.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Bruno Gruber","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fea05","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Loo","original_name":"Richard Loo","popularity":0.3249,"profile_path":"/mCQFpDqmxaNMm0A4SKodUuNA92v.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Colonel Genichi Tomura","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fea09","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacDonald","original_name":"Ian MacDonald","popularity":0.3095,"profile_path":"/NauhxwGcj5yIpHZPKMhglc9RFf.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Carlos Tassuma","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fea0d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Helmore","original_name":"Tom Helmore","popularity":0.1499,"profile_path":"/aEKwGuDjktdF13YBrEAQjC7Te2m.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Matisson","credit_id":"52fe466ec3a36847f80fea11","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeForest Kelley","original_name":"DeForest Kelley","popularity":0.5707,"profile_path":"/qbcWkyGWvv5GKnbCqq9Pne09imA.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Lt.
