When he escapes to return to his family, Sam Franklin, a bounty hunter of Cherokee descent, is hired to find and return him to the institution. Franklin, a former Indian scout for the U.S. Army, has renounced his Native heritage and has adopted the White Man's way of life, believing it's the only way for Indians to survive. Along the way, a tragic incident spurs Franklin's longtime nemesis, the famous \"Indian Fighter\" Sheriff Henry McCoy, to pursue both Franklin and the boy.","popularity":0.4847,"poster_path":"/wTQttoUGWLgAUWp567iyRsruP6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Only Good Indian","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Studi","original_name":"Wes Studi","popularity":1.3271,"profile_path":"/dAO2bY2NCceYLZiJaBjBdY19Hox.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5657e603c3a3683089001611","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winter Fox Frank","original_name":"Winter Fox Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"5657e610c3a3683090001518","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
