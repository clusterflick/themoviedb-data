Then Nickel goes on a school excursion and brings the little piglet Rudy back with him in his rucksack. Once he´s home, he makes a terrifying discovery: dad has a girlfriend! Worse yet, she´s moved in with him and brought her daughter Felicitas (12) along! Nickel makes a deal with Thomas: if those two stay, then so can Rudy.  When life becomes unbearable for Nickel, he flees with Rudy to ‘Porkland’, followed by Feli and pursued by two dumb crooks. It’s the beginning of an adventure that ends in the swamps of the Oder Valley, where Rudi saves the lives of the two children and finds a new home.","popularity":0.8398,"poster_path":"/9Bf7NtgbRchl25rEEG11OXFvOc7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bavaria Film International","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1909,"logo_path":null,"name":"Relevant Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":10946,"logo_path":"/gk4SFkJ3G49gGL308zymD8QGNw.png","name":"WDR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rudy: The Return of the Racing Pig","video":false,"vote_average":6.132,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Rudy: El cerdito corredor","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Rudi, un cerdito en las carreras","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Rudy het racevarken","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Rudy, l'incorrigible petit cochon !","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Koch","original_name":"Sebastian Koch","popularity":0.4597,"profile_path":"/4YFk0qauux4jn68mvIfd5EEtG2v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"52fe465bc3a36847f80fa9ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":834540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Teichert","original_name":"Maurice Teichert","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nickel","credit_id":"52fe465bc3a36847f80fa9f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie von Kessel","original_name":"Sophie von Kessel","popularity":0.1742,"profile_path":"/10dqrNT3dsgmv2pItOgNqWO2QnK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anja","credit_id":"52fe465bc3a36847f80fa9f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sina Richardt","original_name":"Sina Richardt","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Feli","credit_id":"540d8027c3a36879ae0051ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Horwitz","original_name":"Dominique Horwitz","popularity":0.2133,"profile_path":"/3YuwwLvwuDjl6R9RnBQ03A6vp3R.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bomber","credit_id":"540d8032c3a36879ae0051b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludger Burmann","original_name":"Ludger Burmann","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/uKLZ4Fd9n4VOuiDYcKXbtNEQxTF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Einsatzleiter","credit_id":"5c1fd9290e0a264df2ec2dfd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ehrich","original_name":"Maria Ehrich","popularity":0.4248,"profile_path":"/gomciiyCQUVlvbMp3ucfrdOrZAj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"5c1fd933c3a3686fffea572f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Hinterthan","original_name":"Tom Hinterthan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Junge","credit_id":"5c1fd940c3a3686fffea573a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldemar Kobus","original_name":"Waldemar Kobus","popularity":0.4189,"profile_path":"/9CIngBaUFjdkn1JfMAavMyOno9X.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Polizist","credit_id":"5c1fd94bc3a368700eea5fcd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sybille J.
