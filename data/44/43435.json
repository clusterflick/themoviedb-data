But his wife has left him and the appeal of the spotlight isn't what it used to be. This time Jolson trades in the stage for life in the fast lane: women, horses, travel. It takes the death of Moma Yoelson and World War II to bring Jolson back to earth - and to the stage. Once again teamed with manager Steve Martin, Jolson travels the world entertaining troops everywhere from Alaska to Africa. When he finally collapses from exhaustion it takes young, pretty nurse Ellen Clark to show him there's more to life than \"just rushing around\".","popularity":0.7755,"poster_path":"/sswaVzdGmBrDL1Ki0KfpLcclww2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sidney Buchman Enterprises","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The rest of the Jolson story","title":"Jolson Sings Again","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Parks","original_name":"Larry Parks","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/uBKO8ryyaQiRQ7nBIT1uLgzo3Dy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Al Jolson / Himself","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f6207","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Hale","original_name":"Barbara Hale","popularity":1.1286,"profile_path":"/xLE53ZfGifU5hNyjoE6z6FsOU01.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ellen Clark","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f620b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Demarest","original_name":"William Demarest","popularity":0.4836,"profile_path":"/yNr9tzg17nMsrfxqriaWg7PEBlV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Steve Martin","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f620f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludwig Donath","original_name":"Ludwig Donath","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/pMUgXWPZYhddP2BdziOd3FxwVgg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cantor Yoelson","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f6213","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Goodwin","original_name":"Bill Goodwin","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":"/uF4N4A29rgRH1ARfqdll8xXJdgo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tom Baron","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f6217","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myron McCormick","original_name":"Myron McCormick","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/fjcrA8lZbchZ4hH8ZDcTXRGiXMW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ralph Bryant","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f621b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Shayne","original_name":"Tamara Shayne","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/9rlpMiZxUcWPmjbrxoaHPMMZbxf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Moma Yoelson","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f621f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bing Crosby","original_name":"Bing Crosby","popularity":0.5428,"profile_path":"/pKd9vFb9t157v03D4BS1bc5PqOd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"57c52f1fc3a36815c7000964","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Jolson","original_name":"Al Jolson","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/d4AcDb0feqJ2tq5udfka8EYm2hO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself (singing voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"57c52f34c3a3682ca8000494","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Leigh","original_name":"Nelson Leigh","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/qTVomtpRWQb1eUVlZvvWRMYjyuw.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Theater Manager (uncredited)","credit_id":"57c52f45c3a36815cb00092a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1468551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Perry","original_name":"Wanda Perry","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/huYQpmXFdwz7ZFjn11ZoOOAuGs8.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Lady (uncredited)","credit_id":"630fa692abdec00082ec92f9","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sidney Buchman","original_name":"Sidney Buchman","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f6203","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Levin","original_name":"Henry Levin","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/ttdIAzeM9uVLhVy4L1G6mj7ehIU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4647c3a36847f80f61fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41709,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William E.
