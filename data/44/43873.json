He confesses to the priest in front of his friends; he insists that the doctor be truthful. But, he cannot bring himself to tell his son Césariot that his real father is Marius, the absent son of César, Césariot's godfather. Panisse leaves that to Fanny, the lad's mother. Dissembling that he's off to see a friend, Césariot then seeks Marius, now a mechanic in Toulon. Posing as a journalist, Césariot spends time with Marius and leaves believing tales he is a petty thief. Only after the truth comes out can Marius, Fanny, César, and Césariot step beyond the falsehoods, benign though they may be.","popularity":0.4999,"poster_path":"/bD2tr5HY23lWMw5b4LgI6YunCPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marcel Pagnol","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"César","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":66,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La trilogie marseillaise de Marcel Pagnol : César","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raimu","original_name":"Raimu","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/oFCzjEbNFNwGG8oIggETFNPW610.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"César Ollivier","credit_id":"52fe4667c3a36847f80fd223","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Fouché","original_name":"André Fouché","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":29,"character":"Cesariot Panisse","credit_id":"61de1241c525c4004238f67f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":564273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orane Demazis","original_name":"Orane Demazis","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/hVL60LFTRIogiLSPuGDN9Zetvae.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fanny Cabanis","credit_id":"52fe4667c3a36847f80fd22f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Fresnay","original_name":"Pierre Fresnay","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/kHa9UH2jlarWBkpyFSe5n1RsM8u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marius Ollivier","credit_id":"52fe4667c3a36847f80fd227","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernand Charpin","original_name":"Fernand Charpin","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/til2Tyu3BWeZ3ObIkp0cYKuCjqQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Honoré Panisse","credit_id":"52fe4667c3a36847f80fd22b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Vattier","original_name":"Robert Vattier","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":"/40m5BRxxTAGTybya37eaxUvhPey.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Brun","credit_id":"56c0a718925141735900c4df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Dullac","original_name":"Paul Dullac","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/gDuIPVTPFSuqCXKx1Z5HL7HFANH.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Félix Escartefigue","credit_id":"56bf2ae0c3a36817e4000196","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Maupi","original_name":"Marcel Maupi","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/fh5KJ9iniGNpT2fHPaaczYSZxrR.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Innocent Mangiapan","credit_id":"56c102329251410a62000942","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Édouard Delmont","original_name":"Édouard Delmont","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/3B8wzOQwkuvLeBAJuqZG9HWMvhS.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Le docteur Felicien Venelle","credit_id":"56c1028a925141083f000a6a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alida Rouffe","original_name":"Alida Rouffe","popularity":0.1494,"profile_path":"/n992FX2BDWiQyy2NJIWHjqWBZqF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Honorine Cabanis","credit_id":"56be7c8a925141734d0051a1","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milly Mathis","original_name":"Milly Mathis","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/mmBfcvOUslnSTeggUDupoMlaZg6.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Tante Claudine Foulon","credit_id":"56c102b192514109be000920","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":992814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thommeray","original_name":"Thommeray","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Elzéar Bonnegrâce, le curé de Saint Victor","credit_id":"56c102dac3a368180a00ded7","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doumel","original_name":"Doumel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":30,"character":"Fernand, Marius' silent partner","credit_id":"61de12e5c525c4008e5e3cb1","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bassac","original_name":"Robert Bassac","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Pierre Dromard","credit_id":"56c1031392514105da0009e3","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charblay","original_name":"Charblay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Henri -
