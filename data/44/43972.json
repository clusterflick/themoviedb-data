Her persistent refusal of marriage proposals coupled with her unseemly removal of her hood causes her family to seek the help of an exorcist, convinced she must be possessed by evil spirits.  Made surreptitiously in 1977 just as the Ayatollah Khomeini regime was coming to power, a rough cut of ‘The Sealed Soil” was smuggled out of Iran by the director in a false-bottomed suitcase, and taken to the U.S., where she completed her final cut. The film has never been seen in Iran.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":"/kX5CGVVt9Vgf5AR8crLqn8T7Yb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1977-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sealed Soil","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Khake Sar Beh Morh","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Khake Sar Beh Mohr","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Shabaviz","original_name":"Flora Shabaviz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59c0104e9251417db0000d1c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marva Nabili","original_name":"Marva Nabili","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/uoQUcrCPjyJkrrDoH9MpSQ3jxJD.jpg","credit_id":"53220ad59251411f8f003560","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200612,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barbod Taheri","original_name":"Barbod Taheri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542dc0350e0a260bf1000267","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marva Nabili","original_name":"Marva Nabili","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/uoQUcrCPjyJkrrDoH9MpSQ3jxJD.jpg","credit_id":"560dd4e9c3a368681000aebb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0154728","wikidata_id":"Q105492435","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/76axGpiEQmRifwHTHjUXLrWa2wN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lVTevsZ4zzkT49tOIOr209mEiYu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kX5CGVVt9Vgf5AR8crLqn8T7Yb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1977-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
