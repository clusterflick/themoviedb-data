Voters in Bakersfield, California elected a tough on crime district attorney into office for more than 25 years. During his tenure he convicted dozens of innocent working class moms and dads. They went to prison, some for decades, before being exonerated. He remains in office today. This story on a micro level mirrors what the US has experienced over the last eight years. When power is allowed to exist without oversight civil rights are in jeopardy.","popularity":0.2905,"poster_path":"/d48eaPyxqVrFgHgI35GF0SkSFxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some convictions are criminal","title":"Witch Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Penn","original_name":"Sean Penn","popularity":2.54,"profile_path":"/9glqNTVpFpdN1nFklKaHPUyCwR6.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself (Narrator)","credit_id":"59b121ed92514107af08366c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Hardy Jr.","original_name":"Don Hardy Jr.","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe465cc3a36847f80faa07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1020742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Nachman","original_name":"Dana Nachman","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54c77b85c3a36874bf00279d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1196112","wikidata_id":"Q123901043","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xgcdBbMXBEiQyaRdbYR4PzdBRYo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1010,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d48eaPyxqVrFgHgI35GF0SkSFxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (TIFF)","release_date":"2008-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
