She and her lifelong friend Ana are two of the toughest members of their gang, fearing nothing but the loss of each other. Car-jacking, fights, and running from the cops are a daily routine as the girls fight to protect their territory and their reputation. Performing as \"Outrageous Chaos\" in local dance contests provides their only relief, but each night they must return home to the sad reality of their lives.","popularity":0.8053,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15650,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Look Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ana and I have been best friends since fourth grade.","title":"Living the Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrina Gibson","original_name":"Katrina Gibson","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kata","credit_id":"52fe466ac3a36847f80fdd53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Hernandez","original_name":"Jay Hernandez","popularity":1.8252,"profile_path":"/86mlhxglLYYCac1CWWj4s9uR9U9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kikicho","credit_id":"52fe466ac3a36847f80fdd57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":129866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melida Prado","original_name":"Melida Prado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"52fe466ac3a36847f80fdd5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvette Cruise","original_name":"Yvette Cruise","popularity":0.2059,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"52fe466ac3a36847f80fdd5f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Alvarado","original_name":"Angela Alvarado","popularity":0.3075,"profile_path":"/AhxepIZWMZilICWiTEON7LgtNHg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pilar","credit_id":"52fe466ac3a36847f80fdd63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.D.
