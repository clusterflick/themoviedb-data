After he loses a tank, WAC Major Shelton, a psychologist, is assigned to make a good soldier out of him. She requests Corporal Dolan and Private Stan Wensalawsky to help with the training. Dolan and Stan both have scores to settle with Bixby and their \"guidance\" leads to more mishaps. Sergeant Pulley has them shipped out to Morocco. On leave in North Africa, Bixy wanders alone into a bar, has a few Moroccan Delights, which he thinks are malted milks, and becomes convinced that exotic singer-dancer Zita is THE girl for him.","popularity":1.5432,"poster_path":"/kroFIkdhrGqP3bpC7kaIAJ9xJ54.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Wallis Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Lovable Laughable GI Goof!","title":"The Sad Sack","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":31,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Lewis","original_name":"Jerry Lewis","popularity":0.8336,"profile_path":"/3TpijSL83yJYvEurLjCnIU44Fr9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Private Meredith C.
