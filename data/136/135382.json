Once again André Rieu transformed the Vrijthof square in his hometown Maastricht into a grand, romantic open-air concert hall with room for about ten thousand people for his traditional summer evening concerts.  André returns to Maastricht bringing with him two wonderful guest choirs – the Harlem Gospel Choir and the Soweto Gospel Choir – and a very special guest: Oscar-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins! The Hollywood-based star is a great admirer of André Rieu and wrote a piece called “And The Waltz Goes On” specially with Rieu in mind. André Rieu performed it in Maastricht for the first time for such a large crowd.","popularity":0.2051,"poster_path":"/52SzmLXTlY0u944rXcfwFhAaERe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60911,"logo_path":"/Atub6EGDrBdErV4qz6OakSGhrd.png","name":"André Rieu Studios","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André Rieu - Under The Stars: Live In Maastricht V","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"André Rieu - Under the Stars","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"André Rieu - Under The Stars - Live in Maastricht V","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"André Rieu - Under The Stars - Live in Maastricht V","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Rieu","original_name":"André Rieu","popularity":0.2261,"profile_path":"/toabyJ2w8pNf1xM0oJPWSawDpMB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4bf6c3a368484e1a04a9","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ap9P5qpz823eKzlUMuXPYPOPym.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/48AFcwI8pJIqtdNzcvnaHEODoja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/52SzmLXTlY0u944rXcfwFhAaERe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"André Rieu - Trailer: Under The Stars (Live in Maastricht V)","key":"kgo25_hjP9E","published_at":"2012-05-01T10:27:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f2c3a368544800946d"}]}}}
