Vartanov resurrects the riveting scenes from his banned 1969 film The Color of Armenian Land, where Paradjanov concocts the chef-d'oeuvre The Color of Pomegranates - widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time - then reveals the shocking request Parajanov sent him in unpublished 1974 letters from Ukrainian prisons. Vartanov's camera documents Parajanov's staggering last day at work in 1990 during the making of the unfinished Confession - which survives in The Last Spring - as Parajanov comments on this cherished autobiographical film. The foremost achievement of The Last Spring, emphasized by critics, is Vartanov's exquisite wordless montage that \"evoked the very soul\" of Parajanov and earned the praise of many of cinema's greatest masters, such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.","popularity":0.2896,"poster_path":"/ortlPmxvgBqfzJH2xltbfM1j9h1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Varda Nova Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Exemplifies the power of art\" —Francis Ford Coppola","title":"Parajanov: The Last Spring","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"СЕРГЕЙ ПАРАДЖАНОВ.
