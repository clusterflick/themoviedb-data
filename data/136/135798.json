But as the conversation progresses, it becomes clear that this couple, who have never seen each other face to face and who met on the Internet, have actually formed a suicide pact. Problems arise when the couple realizes that they may have finally found something worth living for. Comprised of three continuous takes-one take for each act-and shot over the course of two days, Commit is witty and disturbing, as well as an inspirational achievement in independent filmmaking.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bite the bullet.","title":"Commit","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0986346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
