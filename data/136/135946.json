With a brilliant appearance and empty promises, she serves the hopes and greed of her fellow human beings with virtuosity. With the help of a never-ending stream of money, she buys her way out of situations that would have landed others in prison long ago. Her enemies are just waiting for the pyramid to collapse and bury Adele - and countless small investors with her.","popularity":0.3825,"poster_path":"/5APKUDZrJ0F3TYstj8siaSWUXZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summerset","origin_country":""},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Verführerin Adele Spitzeder","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Minichmayr","original_name":"Birgit Minichmayr","popularity":0.4262,"profile_path":"/gvQqplzS1LEK0Ha14q6HcLsoSRM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Adele Spitzeder","credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a368484e1a413b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunnyi Melles","original_name":"Sunnyi Melles","popularity":0.2509,"profile_path":"/ro6nr4EAYKSrXyuKpACUs0BpMgc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Betty Vio","credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a368484e1a413f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":572648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicia von Rittberg","original_name":"Alicia von Rittberg","popularity":0.4382,"profile_path":"/3cSEvGUxRm2O1xkIuXoebegDVoF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Therese Ederer","credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a368484e1a4143","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Krückl","original_name":"Maximilian Krückl","popularity":0.1874,"profile_path":"/mGNKFrz9oRbyBimhxqSfZZEekiB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Georg Zeitler","credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a368484e1a4147","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Sägebrecht","original_name":"Marianne Sägebrecht","popularity":0.4802,"profile_path":"/bXXVqtflW1tByYNDSqxSQbLm6DB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Edeltraud Staller","credit_id":"536a8f9bc3a368121800814f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karlheinz Hackl","original_name":"Karlheinz Hackl","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/aqqDUEEiCr88VCtixRjJaHMFOmg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Eduard Pohlheim","credit_id":"536a8fa9c3a3681241008713","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Roll","original_name":"Michael Roll","popularity":0.4087,"profile_path":"/l3Mp9CBgM7zbobciavmWN7ZS6Mj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kommissär","credit_id":"536a8fb7c3a3681212008240","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schönborn","original_name":"Michael Schönborn","popularity":0.2742,"profile_path":"/iBVpUMIUHqtAjnGIQCHXHAQupop.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Graf Hochstein","credit_id":"536a8fc5c3a368124a008500","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Herrschmann","original_name":"Johannes Herrschmann","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/8Ve17DoBkKGv5HlmonZga6LyUpA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pfandleiher Stangl","credit_id":"54b83dbb9251411d790029f0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Kalenberg","original_name":"Paula Kalenberg","popularity":0.1999,"profile_path":"/9KYy1QKkY3aaXaL6v93xvHCApKh.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Silvia Berency","credit_id":"54c97311c3a36874b7007423","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49076,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ariela Bogenberger","original_name":"Ariela Bogenberger","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a368484e1a4137","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xaver Schwarzenberger","original_name":"Xaver Schwarzenberger","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/sFusGdTURBrwWvUvdaFpyv9F7Io.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a368484e1a4131","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2151593","wikidata_id":"Q1217124","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5APKUDZrJ0F3TYstj8siaSWUXZE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
