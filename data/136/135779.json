Through a mixture of personal anecdote and social history, she describes the rise of Nazism, the war years, and the Allied occupation, during which she met her future husband, an American soldier. The Ties That Bind breaks with the usual format of war documentaries, thus allowing a different portrait of the individual to emerge, while it reflects on the current political situation in America and the filmmaker's activities in relation to those issues.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/u3KpqrwFJn1ow1HAEyCepfESvZ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ties That Bind","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lore Bucher Friedrich","original_name":"Lore Bucher Friedrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d7593c0a517c00670ae0df","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c04c3a368484e1a2df7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"62d7592b498ef90125f27b3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"62d75923e194b001c613dcbd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"62d759190a517c00670ae0cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u3KpqrwFJn1ow1HAEyCepfESvZ8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
