A hope for more righteous Russia has awakened, but the journey is a long one, and the weight of history exceptionally heavy. However, an idea for new Russia has been born, and continues to grow even at this very moment.  One of the people fighting for change is a Russian author and dissident Victor Erofeyev. He loves his country and wants it to be more tolerant and open-minded. For decades now, he has been criticising the people in charge of Russia. He has also been in trouble with the state since the Soviet times, but does not let the fear hold him back. With his work he wants to encourage the Russians to take a critical look around and try to actively improve their own situation. Now this is finally happening.","popularity":1.5515,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10877,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinocompany","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2012-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Fear To Freedom","title":"Russian Libertine","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1101415,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viktor Erofeyev","original_name":"Viktor Erofeyev","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f90b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Sorokin","original_name":"Vladimir Sorokin","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/giSBN0lFfpuRODJa8QKxr0aq3UV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f939","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1101433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Erofeyev","original_name":"Andrei Erofeyev","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f93d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101416,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ari Matikainen","original_name":"Ari Matikainen","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f911","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1101417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liisa Karpo","original_name":"Liisa Karpo","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f917","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101416,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ari Matikainen","original_name":"Ari Matikainen","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f91d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikko Mäkelä","original_name":"Mikko Mäkelä","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f929","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101420,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Harri Ylönen","original_name":"Harri Ylönen","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f92f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101421,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janne Haavisto","original_name":"Janne Haavisto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf2c3a368484e19f935","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hannu-Pekka Vitikainen","original_name":"Hannu-Pekka Vitikainen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee0fb172dda890020765c25","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2095819","wikidata_id":"Q18693431","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":41278,"name":"russian politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Russian Libertine Official Trailer","key":"NgYZrX5naso","published_at":"2012-04-23T08:11:33.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f1c3a3685448009460"}]}}}
