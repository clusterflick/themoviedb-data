Where these \"Blooded\" hide in fetid slums from the Church of the Angels, commanded by their divine masters to \"cleanse\" the Blood Magic.  Where choices are fraught, alliances rarely safe, and blood is all.  A young monk named Jered flees the Church when his own Blood Magic is released. Now he must survive the pursuit of the Church, the gladiatorial pits of the Blooded underground, and the hidden truths of the ancient struggle. The choices he makes will tip the balance of the war between Church and Blooded, and change his world forever.","popularity":0.2832,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BloodSpell","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Tuck","original_name":"Thom Tuck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jered","credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charmaine Gilbert","original_name":"Charmaine Gilbert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Carrie","credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f8d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Cross","original_name":"Alan Cross","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gad","credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Dunford","original_name":"Caroline Dunford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Arianne","credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f95","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15770,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ben Sanders","original_name":"Ben Sanders","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f79","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103068,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugh Hancock","original_name":"Hugh Hancock","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103068,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugh Hancock","original_name":"Hugh Hancock","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f9b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103302,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve Wallace","original_name":"Steve Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f7f","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alasdair Walker","original_name":"Alasdair Walker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f6d","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103136,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Willem van Heemstra","original_name":"Willem van Heemstra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c00c3a368484e1a1f73","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815371,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phil Rice","original_name":"Phil Rice","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a45520e8729f37e1d3022","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1483748","wikidata_id":"Q4927537","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":177895,"name":"dark fantasy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BloodSpell - Watch entire 84 min fantasy feature film","key":"HfJjb6jzZIA","published_at":"2007-11-09T02:20:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"533ec6f2c3a368544800948e"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BloodSpell official trailer -84-min animated \"punk fantasy\"","key":"3PfBPjd3d4c","published_at":"2007-11-07T15:14:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f2c3a368544800948d"}]}}}
