Carl Panzram was a lifelong prisoner and a hate-filled serial killer. Brutalized in and out of various U.S. state prisons during 20th century America, Panzram unleashed a rampage of revenge that resulted in over 20 murders and countless acts of violent sodomy. A single act of kindness, by prison guard Henry Lesser, sparked a friendship that eventually influenced Panzram to write his autobiography. In 1930, Panzram was hanged for killing a laundry foreman at Leavenworth prison.","popularity":2.414,"poster_path":"/4HSWtOYbkSd4tXn4tKpdyzlyDez.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waterfront Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carl Panzram: The Spirit of Hatred and Vengeance","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Panzram","type":"Short Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John DiMaggio","original_name":"John DiMaggio","popularity":1.5904,"profile_path":"/qcbQe71nSlULDsP1OxTqltEKFbl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carl Panzram","credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Jetmund","original_name":"Brett Jetmund","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Charlie Panzram","credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Lodewyck","original_name":"Tom Lodewyck","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Adult Carl Panzram","credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Salmonson","original_name":"David Salmonson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Young Carl Panzram","credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a7b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":189075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Weiss","original_name":"David Weiss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Henry Lesser","credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a7f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1102340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Ramsland","original_name":"Katherine Ramsland","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self - Forensic Psychologist","credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a9b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Borowski","original_name":"John Borowski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bf8c3a368484e1a0a6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Borowski","original_name":"John Borowski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658dccb41b1f3c5ae7fca85c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1756447","wikidata_id":"Q5040616","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A75qzihI0mNsVTAhrIqEmDz3GwK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mMMv1JurazTcq9P64dz8eynaC2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jATd1Ed34JouS30oShIuofWNmbT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4HSWtOYbkSd4tXn4tKpdyzlyDez.jpg","vote_average":10,"vote_count":4,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9SZ2r85ahZIoK6vThDlOnCrripk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bfitAiJzwtvkaoT5ye2CvG5fI5H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1125}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Carl Panzram Trailer","key":"SBGPswdYRJ0","published_at":"2012-09-16T20:55:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6f2c3a3685448009476"}]}}}
