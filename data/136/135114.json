Zanda is a 28-year-old woman, worn out by hard work. Surrounded by poverty and despair, she is trying to survive with her two children in a god-forsaken Latvian village. Her hardships can be traced back to living in a relationship with her brother Valdis. When Valdis is put in jail, the local community forces her to make a difficult choice: to stay with him or with her children. Despite her ill fortune, she manages to express her love for the children, still hoping to save her family. The film offers a tragicomic but highly authentic insight into the bleak reality of post-soviet era.","popularity":0.0878,"poster_path":"/8wuSvAdR1bnjF61xY88DxFaTIBP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91036,"logo_path":null,"name":"FA Filma","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Instinct","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andris Gauja","original_name":"Andris Gauja","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/5O4NFzLE4GgzCJK9OhLjwwMi07Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4beec3a368484e19f0ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953442,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madara Melberga","original_name":"Madara Melberga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56928d70594003d0185a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891242,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ingus Baušķenieks","original_name":"Ingus Baušķenieks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe568e7160e73003eac806c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andris Gauja","original_name":"Andris Gauja","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/5O4NFzLE4GgzCJK9OhLjwwMi07Q.jpg","credit_id":"5fe5689970309f003d822e78","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889426,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Egons Kronbergs","original_name":"Egons Kronbergs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56901d70594003d018585","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andris Gauja","original_name":"Andris Gauja","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/5O4NFzLE4GgzCJK9OhLjwwMi07Q.jpg","credit_id":"5fe5688d160e73003daade03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105423,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandrs Grebņevs","original_name":"Aleksandrs Grebņevs","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/cQ9eehyZ4ABXssfsURJ0GasO6bV.jpg","credit_id":"5fe568bad70594003f01de6f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2909186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ģirts Koknēvičs","original_name":"Ģirts Koknēvičs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe568d113654500405c52e0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andris Gauja","original_name":"Andris Gauja","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/5O4NFzLE4GgzCJK9OhLjwwMi07Q.jpg","credit_id":"5fe568a4e18b97003e8a0456","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1817142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEvBUIwYjGhFheR8OR3084TZigV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":797,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8wuSvAdR1bnjF61xY88DxFaTIBP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":532},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i6UYPwrq0fAw9ZuinU6lUTdDavb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/igFWgGNtkFIV3Pndj0j4ALPKXJd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ģimenes Lietas (Family Instinct) - FORUM CINEMAS treileris","key":"15120683","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-09-20T11:02:41.000Z","id":"5ffe53a0a4f03c003d382a76"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Family Instinct - trailer of the film","key":"HAftwTfXbMs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-06-17T13:56:59.000Z","id":"65dc7b4e03bf840184afb18e"}]}}}
