She and her mother initially feared that Marc had joined a cult. This documentary traces Julia's efforts to understand his conversion and to revive their relationship, despite her fundamentalist brother's disapproval of her bisexuality. Julia travels from New York City to her brother's religious community, where she and Marc search for common ground and discover the meaning of family.","popularity":0.1245,"poster_path":"/e4rpnb10HtEv9dq4Mu5awkLrEQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brother Born Again","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109206,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Pimsleur","original_name":"Julia Pimsleur","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6623429251414054079f55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten Johnson","original_name":"Kirsten Johnson","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/9h1DYSYLnPujVBtM4mklFDnZByj.jpg","credit_id":"5f77ba7d944a570034c99036","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0285467","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e4rpnb10HtEv9dq4Mu5awkLrEQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
