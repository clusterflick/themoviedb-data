Ben, Hank, Charlie, and John are four spirited youths with a shared love of golf. Determined to play a round at the exclusive Sunset Ridge Country Club despite the fact that none of them are members, the longtime friends sneak onto the golf course, and vow to make their clandestine game an annual event. Over the years, each of the four friends set down different paths in life, but through it all they never miss a game. When 60 years have passed, and the time comes to reflect on their rich and varied experiences, all four realize that it was the power of friendship that helped them endure hard times, and never lose hope that things will get better","popularity":1.9609,"poster_path":"/h5V8Is9uypXWWhF19FiWOYImW48.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boys of Sunset Ridge","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burt Young","original_name":"Burt Young","popularity":0.613,"profile_path":"/8jW1aMWSOjZR5iY3XEqthFj8VeH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hank Bartlowski","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5c03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronny Cox","original_name":"Ronny Cox","popularity":1.2042,"profile_path":"/cKkVkqft2RacSDhsKxO8nMFgeAd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben Thorpe","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5c07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Heard","original_name":"John Heard","popularity":1.1394,"profile_path":"/zjhcxrCFK4q0C1gtVmeN8FeqCw0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Burroughs","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5c0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Morita","original_name":"Pat Morita","popularity":1.0223,"profile_path":"/dwnjbEvhKRanS5xTaI1NkZ98aM9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Charlie Watanabe","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5c0f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Tochi","original_name":"Brian Tochi","popularity":0.5019,"profile_path":"/oFmxzHpo3bw9wn8yx5fNCt9xTC7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Charlie Watanabe at 33","credit_id":"6469cd5fd1857201802d2991","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2506043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
