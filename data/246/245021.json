A seemingly minor accident - a cut on his right thumb - led to dystonia, the involuntary curling of his right hand's ring and little fingers. In recent interviews, Fleisher talks about what followed: the end of a marriage, despair and disappointments, surgery in 1983 that led to a brief return to the concert hall, and, finally, with Botox and Rolfing, the ability to play with two hands. In between, Fleisher discovers his ecstasies: conducting, teaching, and playing compositions for one hand commissioned in the early twentieth century for a World War I veteran.","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":"/bhIX0P5Ls82sT8Qra1bR6MeDd6v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Hands: The Leon Fleisher Story","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathaniel Kahn","original_name":"Nathaniel Kahn","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/bCmZu0MGfdCyIyD1OmJcgKVJ34E.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4efbc3a36847f82b522b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Rose Behr","original_name":"Susan Rose Behr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8fccae109cd0000f437709","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0951151","wikidata_id":"Q2462397","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bhIX0P5Ls82sT8Qra1bR6MeDd6v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
