The largely unknown cast features Steve Lattery, Alex Cole, Cedric Yabrough and Joshua Will.  The foursome play a free-wheeling, competitive style of golf, frequently making use of the \"mulligan\" ( golfing for 'do over'), a technique each of them, not surprisingly, begin to regularly utilize in their everyday (non-golfing) comings-and-goings, with predictably disastrous results.  Eventually, the foursome has difficulty separating golf from their real lives, along with the realization that they really don't like each other that much. A shared enemy serves to reunite the once-happy group however, and they drive off into the sunset on golf carts.","popularity":0.3271,"poster_path":"/mGFbzjFrXOtWf4gsgQSP5vBfTUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mulligan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Lattery","original_name":"Steve Lattery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jordan","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5ba3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280367,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joshua Will","original_name":"Joshua Will","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Langer","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5ba7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cedric Yarbrough","original_name":"Cedric Yarbrough","popularity":0.858,"profile_path":"/7JsXBxOmHpRdNlVdbWJdbe2YFLO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"King","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5bab","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3504017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Thomas Lattery","original_name":"Douglas Thomas Lattery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6255bef232cc2b00672c9df4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim VandeSteeg","original_name":"Tim VandeSteeg","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim VandeSteeg","original_name":"Tim VandeSteeg","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280367,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joshua Will","original_name":"Joshua Will","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934145,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Ross","original_name":"Kevin Ross","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216011","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mGFbzjFrXOtWf4gsgQSP5vBfTUH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
