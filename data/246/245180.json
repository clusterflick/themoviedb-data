Before night falls they build small igloos and we see the construction in detail. The next day a polar bear is seen basking in the warming sun. A woman lights her seal oil lamp, carefully forming the wick from moss. The man repairs his snow goggles. Another man arrives dragging a polar bear skin. The boy has made a bear-shaped figure from snow and practices throwing his spear. Then he tries his bow. Now, with her teeth, the woman crimps the sole of a sealskin boot she is making. The men are hunting seal through the sea-ice in the bleak windy weather. The wind disturbs the \"tell-tales,\" made of eider down or a hair loop on a bone, that signal when a seal rises to breathe. A hunter strikes, kills and drags his catch up and away. At the igloo the woman scrapes at a polar bear skin and a man repairs a sled. In the warming weather the igloo is topped with furs and a snow shelter is built to hide the sled from the sun.","popularity":0.3305,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":112721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Education Development Center (E/D/C)","origin_country":""},{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1967-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Netsilik Eskimo Series, III: At the Spring Sea Ice Camp","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Brown","original_name":"Quentin Brown","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4efec3a36847f82b5f27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985036,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Richard Bergman","original_name":"Richard Bergman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345e934c1d9a0041de8e02","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ken Page","original_name":"Ken Page","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345f1c813831003e870f88","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985037,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elvin Carini","original_name":"Elvin Carini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345ea1700bf70040a2e936","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Smith","original_name":"Kevin Smith","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345ed3a14e100040cee0b6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773810,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malca Gillson","original_name":"Malca Gillson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345f37a14e100040cee190","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Wellington","original_name":"Don Wellington","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345ee66cf3d50040fb91cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985038,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Hirschfeld","original_name":"Jack Hirschfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60345eae97eab4003fd1406d","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Drouin","original_name":"Jacques Drouin","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/yQNUjnMj4Ky9VNC1uwele2U3vwd.jpg","credit_id":"60345efac2b9df003f497bbb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"},{"id":9663,"name":"sequel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"At the Spring Sea Ice Camp (2) - PREVIEW","key":"FeAKVGKSAxQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-05-11T15:45:14.000Z","id":"60345fbb813831004086f891"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"At the Spring Sea Ice Camp - PREVIEW (3)","key":"N62z4GABpfk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-05-11T15:11:00.000Z","id":"60345fdc97eab4003ed151b0"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"At the Spring Sea Ice Camp - PREVIEW (1)","key":"phffAMcdkeQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-05-11T14:54:56.000Z","id":"60345f88a14e10003dcebd29"}]}}}
