The film told the story of a young teacher who emigrated to the vicinity of Lake Baikal in order to teach Polish deportees’ descendants their native language. Many years later, as a married couple with two children, the director and his wife are leaving for Argentina. For their little son, this trip will not only be an encounter with an unknown language. Influenced by their Argentinian friend, Janek enters the fascinating world of imagination, and is introduced to the bitterness of childhood prematurely contaminated by the problems of grown-ups.","popularity":0.122,"poster_path":"/suJx5PFjEfOHn1qGZ4bOlvV0sRg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2011-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Argentinian Lesson","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076349,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wojciech Staroń","original_name":"Wojciech Staroń","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/rLKVwhP8S33InEyw0ot4JqBqZI6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2386185,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zbigniew Osiński","original_name":"Zbigniew Osiński","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fdfb553015363286d97637","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2145561","wikidata_id":"Q19267249","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2m7EViKNflbR5mC4uP0IN5tE4QR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2658,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/suJx5PFjEfOHn1qGZ4bOlvV0sRg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1772},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93cFYV3GAlvpAgOwwOUMs3uIrsB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1031,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKm6Ph9cQrBXqwHVrXGxpMlsiAg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":688},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Na8l5rZEwHzuYKo3SnskmWHAjC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vymDoTeONr0YFIMJjD48rYO61xL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Krakow Film Fest","release_date":"2011-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer: Argentinian Lesson/Argentyńska Lekcja, reż Wojciech Staroń","key":"p5_0CFssZPo","published_at":"2012-05-27T14:34:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec726c3a368544800b9b8"}]}}}
