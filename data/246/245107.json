If only it weren't June and the majority of the population, including his wife and daughter, hadn't been turned into flesh-eating snappers by a mysterious atmospheric phenomenon, he'd be in pretty good shape. Driven by guilt in a race against the apocalyptic clock, Calving teams up with G.M., a wily ex-garbage man turned undead slayer, as together they attempt to deck the halls during the most magical time of the year. It's Christmas in June. And snappers be damned. . . The lights and decorations are going up.","popularity":0.5496,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Christmas Spirit Never Dies","title":"Christmas with the Dead","video":false,"vote_average":6.917,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1280334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian Maffei","original_name":"Damian Maffei","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/1U42lkw8nfRIt5pDwbzmPo4aI1g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Calvin","credit_id":"52fe4efcc3a36847f82b58ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Maule","original_name":"Brad Maule","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/ojdIUjA7VQaYxz4s69S058GtPCE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"G.M.","credit_id":"52fe4efcc3a36847f82b58b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasey Lansdale","original_name":"Kasey Lansdale","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ella","credit_id":"52fe4efcc3a36847f82b58b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chet Williamson","original_name":"Chet Williamson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Reverend Mac","credit_id":"52fe4efcc3a36847f82b58b9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97696,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"T.L.
