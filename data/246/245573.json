Ward Thomas of Park Avenue leads a double life as an investment broker and as notorious gambler Spade Martin, despite the protests of his beautiful wife Natalie, a nightclub singer who retired when they married. Spade's younger brother \"Chick\" wires Spade from Seattle that he has quit gambling for a job in real estate and is about to marry a nice girl named Betty. Relieved to find his kid brother is straight, Spade sends him $10,000 cash as a wedding present. When a woman posing as a pregnant wife comes to Spade for a loan, Spade gives it to her. Later, when Steve Burdick, the woman's supposed husband, brags in a bar that he made a fool of Spade, Spade's hit man, Trigger, kills Burdick. Tired of Spade's gambling, Natalie books a return engagement at Cafe Nocturne, telling him that she is a singer rather than a wife now.","popularity":0.7906,"poster_path":"/oDbQqSy7K8q99Gcwd1fo8ya558C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"HE COULDN'T PLAY STRAIGHT WITH A WOMAN!","title":"Her Husband Lies","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Patrick","original_name":"Gail Patrick","popularity":0.2175,"profile_path":"/ksduouJAKPjjeHMjx12nR7Rtbkt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Natalie Martin","credit_id":"52fe4f07c3a36847f82b8523","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Cortez","original_name":"Ricardo Cortez","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/keRHNE7LFtrwnfJ6wTxrt4gyyxS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"J.
