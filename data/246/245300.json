It shows how a small sphere travels in a determined and rhythmical manner through landscapes, emerging at the end into a larger sphere of white light. Both the graphic brushstroke and the music, with its haunting rhythms, are strikingly simple and direct. The theme of the film, a quest followed by a union, is as old as time and recognizable despite its limitless variations.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/rFm4yLnrQzvcr0I8ojdE1VaEn7c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineteam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Aroma of Tea","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":29,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Dudok de Wit","original_name":"Michael Dudok de Wit","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/oZp0cupuPs4bQffZFoGDtJtpDdB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f02c3a36847f82b6bdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450807,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nic Gill","original_name":"Nic Gill","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2fa18a9b9a400111c3f25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450807,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nic Gill","original_name":"Nic Gill","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea0f53dea37e0001c27eb2f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1145424","wikidata_id":"Q7714320","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pEXtTWGNjdoqFZV8UT9p6SRLA2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rFm4yLnrQzvcr0I8ojdE1VaEn7c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
