It is difficult to remember the last time any concert gave me so much pleasure and insight, and sent my soul soaring to such heights of joy. So many beloved piano pieces, so magnificently performed! Valentina has scaled the heights of technique, knocking off 'impossible' Liszt pieces like a stroll in the park. She melds with the piano with such assured ease that she can milk every piece for musical content and subtlety, reminding us of the great Hoffman, who also loved to play each piece a little differently every time, tapping deeply into the inexhaustible potential of a great composition, perpetually finding fresh ideas and magnificent new interpretations.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valentina Lisitsa: Live at the Royal Albert Hall","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Valentina Lisitsa: Live at the Royal Albert Hall","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1280366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valentina Lisitsa","original_name":"Valentina Lisitsa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Valentina Lisitsa","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1280366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valentina Lisitsa","original_name":"Valentina Lisitsa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":14743,"name":"pianist"},{"id":159868,"name":"playing piano"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BEETHOVEN: Piano Sonata No.14 in C sharp minor, op.27 no.2 \"Moonlight\" - Valentina Lisitsa","key":"UoZsMA9lsc0","published_at":"2012-07-26T17:57:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec726c3a368544800b9b9"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My First Official Interview at Royal Albert Hall (and what came out of it:)","key":"wlw7rT0ZKDM","published_at":"2012-05-26T10:37:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec726c3a368544800b9ba"}]}}}
