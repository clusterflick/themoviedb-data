The factory had been a fixture of the Greenville community for over 100 years until Electrolux uprooted the plant in March of 2006 to move production to Mexico where they could pay workers wages as low as $1.57/hour. This story is told through the voices of employees and the president of their union as they attempt to face the future in a season of difficulty and change.","popularity":0.4205,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outsourcing Greenville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":730,"name":"factory worker"},{"id":1415,"name":"small town"},{"id":156052,"name":"unemployment"},{"id":182256,"name":"outsourcing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
