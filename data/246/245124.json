Surrounded by an (to say the least) unlikely group of assorted hangers-on and supporters, such as a lesbian golf instructor, an ex-girlfriend-turned-nemesis and an annoying caddy who'd be more at home on a surfboard, Tripp somehow manages to make the Tour. It's only then that the two drop-dead gorgeous, bikini-clad, space-gun-wielding aliens appear.  At times hilarious, at other times merely ridiculous, Fairway to Heaven tries to be Caddyshack, but too often more closely resembles Porky's.","popularity":0.2197,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairway to Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Click","original_name":"Ryan Click","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Donny Chain","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryan Tower","original_name":"Ryan Tower","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bradd Tripp","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b1b","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":228871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akira Lane","original_name":"Akira Lane","popularity":6.167,"profile_path":"/rKJKTxDnKWzsjY3VayZh8RwH2ut.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bambie","credit_id":"52fe4efdc3a36847f82b5b1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Diehl","original_name":"Dylan Diehl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nikki","credit_id":"582df9cec3a368773000cc6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meredith Grau","original_name":"Meredith Grau","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lezzie","credit_id":"582df9e4925141095400b079","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":102931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte J.
