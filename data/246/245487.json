This charming, anarchic film is simultaneously tension-filled, beautiful and inspirational. No-one can fail to be moved by the trials which the three adventurers face while negotiating the subcontinent's grandest and most dramatic scenery.  The idea giving rise to the film is to draw on Mike's legendary flying skills to transport Marianne and James to three of Southern Africa's wildest and most remote rock walls, which they will then climb, while documenting the proceedings on camera. Events, however, seldom turn out exactly as expected.  The resulting film, full of the warmth of Africa, is an object lesson in intrepid friendship and contemporary free-spiritedness, set to a kwela soundtrack.","popularity":0.1957,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An African Rock Adventure","title":"No Need for Parking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Schwankhart","original_name":"Marianne Schwankhart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marianne Schwankhart","credit_id":"52fe4f05c3a36847f82b7ce3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Blyth","original_name":"Mike Blyth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mike Blyth","credit_id":"52fe4f05c3a36847f82b7ce7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Pitman","original_name":"James Pitman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"James Pitman","credit_id":"52fe4f05c3a36847f82b7ceb","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3800,"name":"airplane"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
