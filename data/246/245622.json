Interspliced between performance footage of Scott-Heron and his Midnight Band are vignettes of him walking around Washington D.C., spouting his views on then-President Reagan (dubbed \"Ray-Gun\") and generally dropping knowledge. The live performance features many of Scott-Heron's best-known hits, including \"Johannesburg,\" \"Winter in America,\" and \"Angel Dust,\" among others. Warm, intelligent, and insightful throughout, Scott-Heron is clearly enjoying himself and the opportunity to espouse his views. A must for any fan of Scott-Heron's, and definitely worth a look for fans of the funkier jazz music of the mid to late 1970's.","popularity":1.9747,"poster_path":"/z2at1aFypUbqBRVrCzXpl6cTjs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mug-Shot","origin_country":""},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/iNB1FCwT4XjO6wkN3PnpPnwr9GX.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"With The Most Dangerous Musician Alive, Gil Scott-Heron","title":"Black Wax","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Scott-Heron","original_name":"Gil Scott-Heron","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":"/aPzGn9u1qhXfF6Wfil8C7gUofsE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"552fe857c3a3681c41001260","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1652225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen 'Astro' Turner","original_name":"Glen 'Astro' Turner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"578b78dcc3a3682bb2008181","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1652226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Scott-Heron","original_name":"Gia Scott-Heron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"578b78e892514132c300703b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Brady","original_name":"Ed Brady","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58b3935dc3a368522000fd36","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":277304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Mugge","original_name":"Robert Mugge","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552fe82f9251413b3b0040c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":277304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Mugge","original_name":"Robert Mugge","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578b791bc3a3682bca008ac9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":277304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Mugge","original_name":"Robert Mugge","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578b78fd9251413281006fde","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":983118,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Larry McConkey","original_name":"Larry McConkey","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646e7d8517c4430136084640","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0083657","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gw79mrjrmkZo5YoBUtsNaBsiC49.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1412}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":780,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z2at1aFypUbqBRVrCzXpl6cTjs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":520},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/shHcB6Pf2DjtkBPbIV7y0b6Uxqh.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2ghNUg0eaZS8s2CQjRN8JjQcybU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
