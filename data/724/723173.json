The clich√©s of the sex worker as unable to receive or give love, lacking in agency, desperate and even unredeemable, are presented with overflowing evidence from some of Hollywood's most respected films. A fascinating insight into how cinema impacts real-world communities and a hopeful argument for the power of cinema to comfort and inspire.","popularity":0.0497,"poster_path":"/92GsM2mBXHogY1G3gl1ji1ooOes.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whores on Film","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliana Piccillo","original_name":"Juliana Piccillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3L90NPjqgMDtjoTT6wbQus7egX5.jpg","credit_id":"5f076fd213a320003572c93f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9608710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/92GsM2mBXHogY1G3gl1ji1ooOes.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (Raindance)","release_date":"2019-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
