While confined to a psychiatric ward at age 50, \"Richart\" Tracy made this discovery: \"If you want to get out of the hospital - start making art like this. They will get rid of you - fast!\"  Seventeen years later, he's turned three residential lots into a massive black and white maze of his visions. This documentary takes a trip through his yard, art, methods and his mind. Wait until you see what he keeps in his basement!","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawn Smallman","original_name":"Dawn Smallman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f080a991f98d1003618f7ac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0809fd1f98d10038177e3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1366076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanessa Renwick","original_name":"Vanessa Renwick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f080a5b93db920034473ec7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Daniel","original_name":"Bill Daniel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f080a4e1d1bf4003867f9c9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Snider","original_name":"Greg Snider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f080ade93db920034473ef5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Snider","original_name":"Greg Snider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f080aede10f46003736a7e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawn Smallman","original_name":"Dawn Smallman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f080a8093db9200364a3f71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RICHART","key":"410372581","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-21T21:14:32.000Z","id":"5f080b0f1f98d100371ad40e"}]}}}
