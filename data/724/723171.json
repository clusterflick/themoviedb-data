While the public outcry resulted in some short-term relief for the most in need, Obomsawin reveals that the crisis persists in the isolated First Nation. Relief homes sent to the community are not equipped to deal with the harsh winter, as overcrowding and homelessness remain daily realities. Despite their ordeals, the residents of Attawapiskat remain strong, united in love and a belief that a better future must be achieved.","popularity":0.2536,"poster_path":"/70GzZDAd5DMeKtyUiDBSMCwsKWC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The People of the Kattawapiskak River - Six Months Later","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"5f076f00e10f46003935a058","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"5f076f121f98d1003719801a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"5f076f1c1d1bf40037651d13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/70GzZDAd5DMeKtyUiDBSMCwsKWC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
