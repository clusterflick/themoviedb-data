Adults now, they have gone their separate ways, but still live close to each other in central Tokyo. Hiroki works for a newspaper company, and Takeshi has followed in his father's footsteps to work at the Tsukiji fish market. Both men love Kaoru, but Hiroki is too shy to express it.

After three years, Takeshi comes out of his coma - but with no memory of his engagement.","popularity":0.4056,"poster_path":"/oVRlIIluZFWT2pz2OOAwSySzebl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven Can Wait.
