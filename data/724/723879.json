An abandoned area can be seen from this building, a factory with a glorious past, laying there while waiting for a sumptuous, well-structured restoration project. At the same time, a rom family has been living for a long time in a camper there, trying to fit in this space. Far from there, an old worker, keeps his passion for aircrafts and dreams to have one last flight. Sounds and movements linking environment and man, and representing a shared dignity in facing the seasons that go by.","popularity":0.0686,"poster_path":"/67Qd2DYAF91AoSgAhB5e7iYcpR2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Confession Oeuvre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alberto Gemmi","original_name":"Alberto Gemmi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0aefaf93db9200374e15a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alberto Gemmi","original_name":"Alberto Gemmi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0aefbc1f98d100361e7c6a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alberto Gemmi","original_name":"Alberto Gemmi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0aefc6f48b3400350095d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirco Marmiroli","original_name":"Mirco Marmiroli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0aefd3efe37c0035c43293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirco Marmiroli","original_name":"Mirco Marmiroli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0aefdd5e12000038efae2c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirco Marmiroli","original_name":"Mirco Marmiroli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0aefe655bc35003422cc3a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francesco Pastore","original_name":"Francesco Pastore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0af01093db9200374e15f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","original_name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0af01d93db9200374e1642","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","original_name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0af0265e12000038efaeb6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397486,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giancarlo Rutigliano","original_name":"Giancarlo Rutigliano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0af0325e12000038efaec6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Bertini","original_name":"Stefano Bertini","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kJazN3tsyIFCGqn2TFKUk4gR8tB.jpg","credit_id":"5f0af045efe37c0036c7019a","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709853,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Ganapini","original_name":"Andrea Ganapini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0af05193db9200365205fe","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67Qd2DYAF91AoSgAhB5e7iYcpR2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"Visions du RÃ©el 2016","release_date":"2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OODC - International Trailer","key":"129887565","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-05T13:26:19.000Z","id":"5f0af0dfefe37c0035c434aa"}]}}}
