We first meet two English builders, employed to replace the garden fence, temporarily removing the barrier between the house and a Pakistani neighbour.  This introduces the film’s central theme of hospitality which ultimately finds its expression when a homeless Slovakian man charms the Filmmaker’s Colombian cleaner to let him in and tests everyone's ideas of the expectations and boundaries between host and guests.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/h0qGHQMhoNDfbWVLORhFMVNSNCR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bungalow Town Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Filmmaker's House","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Isaacs","original_name":"Marc Isaacs","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/j8ttMWou4rObhBEYkIvb7jSQX83.jpg","credit_id":"5f0752ac5e12000037e2f1ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13387436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h0qGHQMhoNDfbWVLORhFMVNSNCR.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1118,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6n81fZPaowSAXMh6T2Y5TFUCfNZ.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":745}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Filmmaker's House | Official UK Trailer","key":"VLA3KnhMSFM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-11-09T11:19:14.000Z","id":"60773dbf7a97ab006de7f108"}]}}}
