Author of the book “Rules for Radicals”, Alinsky is widely considered the father of community organizing who spent his life advocating for improved living conditions in poor communities across the United States. In this impassioned debate, the young activists question the corrupting influence of power, and ask why Indigenous people cannot live traditionally and peacefully on the land. Alinsky responds, “You have got to be part of the world in order to change it. You are not going to make any changes by staying in your corner.” In Alinsky’s view, equality only happens when the disenfranchised have the strength to show the ruling powers that it will be more costly for them to withhold it. Encounter with Saul Alinksy offers fascinating insights into a conversation about power and activism that has lasting resonance today.","popularity":0.3581,"poster_path":"/9MOZ7p5zk3atNMSjmyJr53PVLE8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encounter with Saul Alinsky - Part 2: Rama Indian Reserve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duke Redbird","original_name":"Duke Redbird","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656d0f02e38bd800aa485de3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2490848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saul Alinsky","original_name":"Saul Alinsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hPnzuXDSH4tgfR3rNeQlAGkZX98.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"656d158356846300ee131b69","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Pearson","original_name":"Peter Pearson","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/w4S4RUM0mE1A8OIe00UCXZnLh00.jpg","credit_id":"5f09731a93db92003547d5fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u9gFjpWtZBOV5Yma0DwWtloAuiq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1151,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9MOZ7p5zk3atNMSjmyJr53PVLE8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":324527,"name":"community organizing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Encounter with Saul Alinsky - Part 2: Rama Indian Reserve","key":"F4duwrVCs2s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2020-10-14T15:00:09.000Z","id":"656d0d4d880551011d1db6d7"}]}}}
