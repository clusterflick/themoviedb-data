As events get out of hand, the rivalry between blacks and whites turns into a murderous mob riot.  Birmingham Opera’s artistic director Graham Vick takes up the challenging of mounting Tippett’s both visionary and eccentric opera, that has remained unstaged since its premiere in 1977. An unused warehouse is transformed into an airport terminal, through which the audience enters a participatory experience, ushered by the chorus.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/smGl2VouDMmA5eVSsZGPboyGI3w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ice Break - Tippett","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Slater","original_name":"Andrew Slater","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f097fc25e12000035e42081","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Benjamin","original_name":"Nadine Benjamin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f097fc955bc35003324fe6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Ramgobin","original_name":"Ross Ramgobin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f097fd3e10f460038382ce6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Corley","original_name":"Stephanie Corley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f097fdb93db9200374b540b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrystal E Williams","original_name":"Chrystal E Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f097fe455bc3500352258b0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708829,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Tippett","original_name":"Michael Tippett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f09801913a32000347560a7","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Gourlay","original_name":"Andrew Gourlay","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f098000d5ffcb0034888948","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Vick","original_name":"Graham Vick","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f097ff355bc35003420a91b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/smGl2VouDMmA5eVSsZGPboyGI3w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
