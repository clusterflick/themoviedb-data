Monk discusses some ideas underlying her work: her attraction to the eloquence of the human voice, and the direct communication made possible by the abstract qualities of music; her emphasis on the poetic rather than the political; her belief in the power of images; her willingness to take risks. She describes her experiences in working in different media, such as audio recordings, films, and videos, and the challenge of weaving them together.","popularity":0.2739,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1994-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meredith Monk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Meredith Monk - en avantgarde-kunstner","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Meredith Monk","type":"Opening title (credits)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Meredith Monk","original_name":"Meredith Monk","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0a013f55bc350035230b42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Easter","original_name":"Allison Easter","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0a4e96f48b340035fe6bcd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Emerson","original_name":"Dina Emerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0a4ec1d100b6003608f87f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Geissinger","original_name":"Katie Geissinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0a4ef013a320003476835d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Bogdan","original_name":"Thomas Bogdan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f0a4f18d5ffcb00348a1220","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2709225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidsel Mundal","original_name":"Sidsel Mundal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a015913a320003578e630","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269349,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gaute Nistov","original_name":"Gaute Nistov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a51ebefe37c0036c57841","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709452,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Helge Løvoll","original_name":"Helge Løvoll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a518fd100b6003808b9db","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marianne Vinje","original_name":"Marianne Vinje","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a52241f98d100371ff6c6","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709447,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kari Dæhlin","original_name":"Kari Dæhlin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a508ef48b340034fd5f1e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rolf Larsen","original_name":"Rolf Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a5042efe37c0035c374ff","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanne Hoel","original_name":"Hanne Hoel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0a5277d5ffcb003583b24a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":176485,"name":"female artist"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
