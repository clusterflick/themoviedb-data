It documents draft resistance, the growth of G.I. coffee houses, the development of alternative media and the early days of Newsreel itself. It is particularly useful in its exploration of the problems the movement faced in using mainstream media to broadcast its message. It is also a document of the philosophies, tactics, and problems of the student movement in the crucial year of 1968. It is most useful when background information can also be provided.","popularity":0.2228,"poster_path":"/4UXjH7S3j04g08rDdIJ9IDNkAXz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newsreel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer '68 (Newsreel #505)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Newreel #505","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Summer of 1968","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3874298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c44fbd871b3400c3b0ca91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3874299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Grizzard","original_name":"Vernon Grizzard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c44fec0231f200d30f1439","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3874302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Shero","original_name":"Jeff Shero","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c45055aaec7100946817a0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Fruchter","original_name":"Norman Fruchter","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f06ea841d1bf40036632e4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Douglas","original_name":"John Douglas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/dHTsZ1t905sdweGtuA5n9QLd5fT.jpg","credit_id":"5f06f731b7abb50036e1e0db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1135987","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yV4kx9lv99SUrBbo1ZEkCIMiQxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4UXjH7S3j04g08rDdIJ9IDNkAXz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
