A solid success when it opened on Broadway in 1944, BLOOMER GIRL boasts a glorious score by the legendary team of Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg (THE WIZARD OF OZ). The book by Fred Saidy is set at the brink of the Civil War and addresses issues of women's equality (priorities were the right to vote and to wear bloomers, a liberating alternative to hoop skirts) and racial equality.","popularity":1.2938,"poster_path":"/et3YNeAnhmGT6N9Xwr4JePygsEb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showcase
