It depicts Rébuffat in full ascent of the Flammes De Pierre, wild ridges in the heart of the Mont Blanc massif overlooking Chamonix. Like Roger Frison-Roche, Walter Bonatti, René Desmaison or Giusto Gervasutti, Gaston Rébuffat has written and filmed the great pages of contemporary mountaineering but above all, he knew how to talk about it with enough poetry so that it is not simply airtight race stories for spectators. Stories that have been triggers for many readers, who have come to know “stone flames” thanks to him.","popularity":0.1771,"poster_path":"/p3wvc9MBnW4gkmgU2hl8uSIVuOp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1947-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flammes De Pierres","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c2b0b3ede1b0011f7e307a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4183531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Couttet","original_name":"James Couttet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pCqE3pFfNVHp6MaAGCCKINGcpLS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c2b0c79e401200c520f028","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3989685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Thiollière","original_name":"Suzanne Thiollière","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/dGyzDdSJ1lmOAOfZelUpK28GG4D.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c2b0f2097c490100d27ab1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","credit_id":"64c2b0a9db4ed600c784e01e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7142638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6xARKVwetIFg48aLX8YE0KFbYgZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3wvc9MBnW4gkmgU2hl8uSIVuOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":307663,"name":"mountain pioneer"},{"id":316125,"name":"alps"},{"id":320873,"name":"gaston rebuffat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
