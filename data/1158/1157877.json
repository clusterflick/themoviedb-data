Then tensions and tail fins flare in \"Bubble Buddy,\" as SpongeBob irks everyone with his provocative new best friend: a silent--yet rather demanding--bubble. Surprisingly witty, fast-paced humor and fresh, detailed animation make watching each quirky show a visual and auditory treat. But the great lure of SpongeBob is that his dilemmas relate equally well to young and old.","popularity":0.0842,"poster_path":"/givKUvDlV3gESqQxLxofgLTQhCj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SpongeBob SquarePants: Anchors Away","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/givKUvDlV3gESqQxLxofgLTQhCj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
