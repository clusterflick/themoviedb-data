It was filmed in the winter of 2015 at Towangseong Waterfall, a sacred place in the history of Korean mountaineering located in Mt. Sorak. Ipsuk Bugeun represents the stark beauty of nature, created by the transiently shaped ice walls against the elaborately forged rocks formed through time, and human’s genuine and sublime pursuit to witness the artistry and splendor of nature. The lines excerpted from the novel which depicts a boy’s existential grow through encountering moments of justice, friendship, death and rests in a composed matter are translated synesthetically into Jang’s video. Collaboration with art director Lee Kyungsoo(workroom) the original typeface from the 1962’s Ipsuk Bugeun was adapted to the film and music direction by Jung Jaeil enhances the narrative experience of the viewer appealing to auditory sense.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/dMZ8Dg9mXAp0IgdpZL9j2iuRAvc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arcadia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jang Min-seung","original_name":"Jang Min-seung","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3d683eec4f301444b3e2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2127965,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jung Jae-il","original_name":"정재일","popularity":0.2838,"profile_path":"/a1q0hsgTTUJwaq0T3W02mi1b6Q6.jpg","credit_id":"64c3d6b7eec4f30125a38bb4","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jang Min-seung","original_name":"Jang Min-seung","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3d6caec370c00ad51c907","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184837,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yunho Lee","original_name":"Yunho Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3d6e6d861af01390a1833","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204664,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kim Sunhyuk","original_name":"Kim Sunhyuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3d71d028f1400ee9d877a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184839,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kyeongsoo Lee","original_name":"Kyeongsoo Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3d73f43250f01265bd912","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dMZ8Dg9mXAp0IgdpZL9j2iuRAvc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
