In \"Happy Hearts Day,\" Olie and Billy turn up their noses at Zowie's extensive preparations for \"Gooey Hearts Day.\" When Mrs. Polie sets up a play date with the new neighbor girl, Polie Pi, the boys are initially begrudging. A quick bite by the \"looove bug\" soon has the boys competing with one another and showing off to impress Polie Pi, but this results in Polie Pi feeling sad and left out. \"Top Dog Fish\" finds Olie and Zowie enamored with the class fish they're caring for over the weekend and has pet dog Spot desperately begging for attention. In \"Mom's Night Out,\" Mrs. Polie is off for a few sets of bowling while Pappy and the kids have a barbeque in the back yard. After promising not to leave a mess, the trio decides to make a 17-layer cake that leaves the kitchen in a shambles.","popularity":0.6784,"poster_path":"/3UpP4Z1Gdp3KI4AYZbM5dyw4IBQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rolie Polie Olie: Happy Hearts Day","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":110555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cole Caplan","original_name":"Cole Caplan","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Olie (voice)","credit_id":"64c595b8eec5b50139ff8aac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Bone","original_name":"Kristen Bone","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":"/74FAdD9Pz0NZIBEJUqZMnEZjHFg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zowie (voice)","credit_id":"64c595f063a695012040b20d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":234701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Tucci","original_name":"Joshua Tucci","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Billy Bevel (voice)","credit_id":"64c5962c63e6fb00fef1c7b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Disher","original_name":"Catherine Disher","popularity":0.3578,"profile_path":"/4KQR1ke8UdW4y0HMUCARIAG4Dwk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mom (voice)","credit_id":"64c5964741aac40fb435e8b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Truss","original_name":"Adrian Truss","popularity":0.1342,"profile_path":"/hmNSAe50OU4QWXMD71214Ax1K2Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dad (voice)","credit_id":"64c5966763e6fb011b3a127b","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3UpP4Z1Gdp3KI4AYZbM5dyw4IBQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
