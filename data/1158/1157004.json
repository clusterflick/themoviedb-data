The 2018 Special Raxen Report warns that there is an intensification on a global scale of acts of intolerance and hate speech; a phenomenon the authors have agreed to call the \"globalization of intolerance,\" which, they warn, is normalizing identity hatred.

In the network these messages are available to anyone. There are more than 1,500 web pages that promote hate, discrimination and violence against those who are different and are also promoting illicit associationism in this area.
