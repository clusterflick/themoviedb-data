Wang Ye, believed to ward off diseases and evil spirits, is celebrated through building, parading, and burning a wooden boat. Without interviews or dialogue, the visual narrative invokes spirituality and imagination through depictions of people, fire, and the god.  ‘This film is not a documentation of folk traditions, but a reconstruction of how the villagers enact their pilgrimage and interact with their gods of spirits. The religious rituals in Taiwan are always noisy and seemingly chaotic, yet with a strong force of life. To make the meaning of the ritual easier to grasp, the film tries to reveal passion and paranoia of the pilgrims and turn it into a spectacle of joy and pathos. This is the only thing I expect to achieve in the film.’ - CHANG Chao-tang","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":"/yROm9kNbhYvxyzOVXSy22qyoTQF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1979-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boat-Burning Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Doyle","original_name":"Christopher Doyle","popularity":0.3773,"profile_path":"/dm2g37ak1EzIu1YViAwvZAvytlx.jpg","credit_id":"663fb71ad58cbb6e98c07b59","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Oldfield","original_name":"Mike Oldfield","popularity":0.1861,"profile_path":"/zXG5jeZDEIW6o1cInUiLqklHlUX.jpg","credit_id":"663fb7735596019a5d7e8a64","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"66422cc876e5ec1ae4968f15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2040060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Chao-Tang","original_name":"張照堂","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/43U7LH5tnW9KQvgWYwDMC7gQ0SD.jpg","credit_id":"664342a842c295292d35cf1d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54KYhsGmIH5n27nndQCOnwbMJss.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.735,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yROm9kNbhYvxyzOVXSy22qyoTQF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1979-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
