The explicit text functions as a base to the implicit, scripted performance of the two actors. Each actor was a proxy of either Simhayof Shahaf or I, but while we felt comfortable to be playful and outgoing during the writing process, it was important for us to remain soft and withholding in the way we portrayed living female bodies on the screen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Next Time You Are Fired","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4183416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Yakirevitch","original_name":"Alina Yakirevitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c29675097c49013a3224a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
