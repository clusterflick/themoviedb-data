This normalcy is interrupted when he receives a call from the Devil, which Fausto dismisses as a prank. After hanging up, his glass of water explodes, and his boss, Carolina, approaches him. Fausto is shocked to hear the same voice from the phone coming out of his boss's mouth—the Devil's voice reminding him that this is his eternal punishment. Fausto knows what he must do; he takes an axe and kills Carolina. Then everything resets—the phone rings again, and Fausto is doomed to repeat the moment that earned him his place in hell, destined to relive it for all eternity.","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":"/vzianBAMOFX7CJJ2nQXJguRsExZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaiopote
