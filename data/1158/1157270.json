In the middle of a scene in which old men storm and attack the Acropolis, which the women of Athens have taken, the ensemble learns that they are surrounded because anti-riot forces are marching around the building and putting down a large demonstration. The street noise is deafening, and the room is filled with fear and anger. Some want to hide, others, led by the leading actress, want to go out into the streets and fight alongside the people. Despite disagreements, one thing is clear, the team does not want to continue the play in the time of the revolution.","popularity":0.0828,"poster_path":"/3vFhT8aPPRDVBQDnZlkFkpSZm6Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosebud Entertainment Pictures","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":204962,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wattson","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2025-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sun Will Rise","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4069841,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthieu Guillot","original_name":"Matthieu Guillot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36c1a6331b2013920cab1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184399,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emel Mathlouti","original_name":"Emel Mathlouti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36beb6331b2011ca11b8a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059775,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elodie Rassel","original_name":"Elodie Rassel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36bd8eec4f3010624a866","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885749,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julien Vicaire","original_name":"Julien Vicaire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36c076331b200e23867a0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124039,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxime Lebidois","original_name":"Maxime Lebidois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36be1028f1400cd289468","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54002,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ayat Najafi","original_name":"Ayat Najafi","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36bce028f1400ee9d5f0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932368,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Angelo Laudisa","original_name":"Angelo Laudisa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36bf6eec4f301444b0f3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2507458,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michaël Grassi","original_name":"Michaël Grassi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36c116331b200c588ad70","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54002,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ayat Najafi","original_name":"Ayat Najafi","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36bc2028f1401300466cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54002,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ayat Najafi","original_name":"Ayat Najafi","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c36c24028f1400ee9d5f40","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gvLNkMOUrUxfw7lCMe1mhdDHyYD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3vFhT8aPPRDVBQDnZlkFkpSZm6Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Premiere at 20th Giornate degli Autori","release_date":"2023-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
