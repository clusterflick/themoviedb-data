The film reimagines the classic late 19th-century greek drama in a 21st-century context rethinking the recent European economic and political crisis between Greece and Germany. The new story of Golfe highlights particular ideological traits that gained popularity within the indignation movement and parliamentary politics in Greece during the time of an imminent Grexit. The film employs elements of Esoteric Nazism, Perennialism, Eurasianism, and the Third-Rome doctrine to reflect on nationalism and the dark ideological intricacies of that period.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/4fqGyNUMLjEN7qsGiGnuboyEcFy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ein bukolisches Liebesdrama Ã¼ber die griechisch-deutsche Krise","title":"Golfe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Athanasios Anagnostopoulos","original_name":"Athanasios Anagnostopoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tasos","credit_id":"64c6066363aad20209a52ff9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Maj Schmidt","original_name":"Johanna Maj Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Golfe","credit_id":"64c60673eec5b50139ffd553","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187631,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Natasa Diavasti","original_name":"Natasa Diavasti","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Stavroula","credit_id":"64c6068ceec5b50139ffd562","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fil Ieropoulos","original_name":"Fil Ieropoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xACcchKP85ZkcDVuten5bFaVM3O.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Zisis","credit_id":"64c6069863aad20209a53011","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Gritsas","original_name":"Dimitris Gritsas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"64c606a5cadb6b01256fe63b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3287754,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Foivos Dousos","original_name":"Foivos Dousos","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Kitsos","credit_id":"64c606b741aac40fb4362b07","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187632,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Filanthi Bogea","original_name":"Filanthi Bogea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6061595ce24013b9b9111","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fil Ieropoulos","original_name":"Fil Ieropoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xACcchKP85ZkcDVuten5bFaVM3O.jpg","credit_id":"64c605be41aac40fb5482b97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Athanasios Anagnostopoulos","original_name":"Athanasios Anagnostopoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c605cf41aac40fb3e542f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vasso Anagnostopoulou","original_name":"Vasso Anagnostopoulou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c605e463a695012040ee2b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187631,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Natasa Diavasti","original_name":"Natasa Diavasti","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c605f3cadb6b00c829cc2b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Athanasios Anagnostopoulos","original_name":"Athanasios Anagnostopoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6062e95ce24013b9b9124","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fil Ieropoulos","original_name":"Fil Ieropoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xACcchKP85ZkcDVuten5bFaVM3O.jpg","credit_id":"64c605fe63e6fb00acdc38b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fil Ieropoulos","original_name":"Fil Ieropoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xACcchKP85ZkcDVuten5bFaVM3O.jpg","credit_id":"64c60639cadb6b00e75d2b89","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4fqGyNUMLjEN7qsGiGnuboyEcFy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
