Bonobos are the species with which humans share the most DNA, but unlike our species, they are matriarchal, live without conflict, and are unabashedly sexual.  A paean to perversion, the film combines animation, live action and song to challenge attitudes about sex, language and our relationship to nature.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesser Apes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Vey Duke","original_name":"Emily Vey Duke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c2e76c9590e300af60d9aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cooper Battersby","original_name":"Cooper Battersby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c2e7619590e300c8d1df38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
