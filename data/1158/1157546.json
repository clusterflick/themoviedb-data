He's doing a famous painting to be. Movie director Alfred Fitchcock moves in next door. Fitchcock is making a movie about a man stranded in the frozen Arctic. Gaston takes it seriously. He paints a toaster, stuffs the freezing man in it, and pops him out like a piece of toast. Gaston thinks that he's doing a good deed. Fitchcock is furious.","popularity":0.1795,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaston Is Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Swift","original_name":"Allen Swift","popularity":0.2498,"profile_path":"/62vJi6tRedgNoGm8vFi1UZhrd3X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64c4405a41aac4013b0293bc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Rasinski","original_name":"Connie Rasinski","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c44016ec0c58010737a2f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gene Deitch","original_name":"Gene Deitch","popularity":0.2276,"profile_path":"/6E6XdQCbcqTepyyJXYmnxXQ4lWR.jpg","credit_id":"64c4401cd04d1a00e40c4dec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Morrison","original_name":"Tom Morrison","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c44032eec5b500c5f0f00e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larz Bourne","original_name":"Larz Bourne","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c44042ec0c5800c9464871","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557237,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bob Kuwahara","original_name":"Bob Kuwahara","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c4404cec0c5800e80b286a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
