The departure of his older sister finds him losing his one point of anchorage. Destabilized, recently sober; he’s lost his footing, and something is liable to happen. There’s nothing between him and the rest of the world—oversensitive—he’s naked to the air. He can’t want what he wants. He must be on his guard. He changes trajectory. The only remaining point of reference; what other people want. Zacharias hurtles through the world and hopes to be done.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/aW5wvJzhWMJVjhPaPVdaCZhb3OK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Days of Regret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3676023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isac Calmroth","original_name":"Isac Calmroth","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/doyeUwvMsSkNuNzak9kBt26fNuP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Zacharias","credit_id":"66991aeb83a7797a2dbfd56e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836465,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hanna Rosén","original_name":"Hanna Rosén","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669919e4a307e3dc832c73b8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2570040,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yousra Said","original_name":"Yousra Said","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66991ac5780e5d4c9f29aace","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yousra Said","original_name":"Yousra Said","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669919a18c7f1558ab0f720a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4365884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Didrik Thurfjell","original_name":"Didrik Thurfjell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66991a5d39b65389c1d23988","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836470,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Filip Fritz","original_name":"Filip Fritz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66991ab0bbbf417eeb18667a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nils Bolin","original_name":"Nils Bolin","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66991a92505f1ba9ef806afa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aW5wvJzhWMJVjhPaPVdaCZhb3OK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
