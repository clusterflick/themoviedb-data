This cease-fire rupture answered an attack of Israel which had killed six combatants on November 4th 2008.  One cannot thus speak about self defence as Israel prevailed itself about it, but well rather of a war against Gaza.  Like Richard Falk says it: â€œThis approach aiming at punishing Gaza was intrinsically criminal: it violates laws of the war and led to crimes against humanity.\"  The film works several types of images and sounds to recover on Internet by confronting them with some tapes of texts.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/4753BjU0NfCyFXlALaP6mdzAlpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WARONGAZA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Beauvais","original_name":"Yann Beauvais","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/jTAHhdTQziEGqydwy6537mNSPiw.jpg","credit_id":"64c45d7363aad2020b7a22a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4753BjU0NfCyFXlALaP6mdzAlpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
