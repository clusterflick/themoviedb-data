I was compelled to investigate the relationship between my body and animal bodies, especially those who are physically larger than myself, and who are not pets but rather those who live amongst their kind. Therefore my interactions with them were not based on a pre condition of habits such as petting or mutual care seeking. If there was touch or closeness, they were of a non scripted and unexpected nature.  In the process of making this film I used a GoPro camera for its small size and because it doesnâ€™t need to be held while shooting, so that the camera could be placed in various positions in relation to the animals bodies. This way I could capture the subjects from up close without causing them distress.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touch the Cow","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4183416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Yakirevitch","original_name":"Alina Yakirevitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c295d913a32000e21b3f8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
