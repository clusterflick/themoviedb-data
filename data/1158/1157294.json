The main hero and villain wear flamboyant outfits that make the Village People look like bankers.  The plot involves two rival groups searching for treasure.  Along the Telugu trail are musical interludes, violent gunfights,  big battles and big women (as actress Jane Russell would say, \"full figured gals\").  The Tollywood cowgirls treat us to frequent catfights.  Overall, from a Western perspective, this is the Wild West on acid.","popularity":0.1454,"poster_path":"/6B2PXAxpJrF3VqRIT3lZqaak4nu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":238,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gunfighter Johnny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krishna","original_name":"Krishna","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/wIg0NVjliLUR5xTcrjWB3B9hZJD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"64c386241d1bf4010249e1a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":994046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jyothi Lakshmi","original_name":"Jyothi Lakshmi","popularity":0.3527,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64c386381d1bf4013c097502","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K.
