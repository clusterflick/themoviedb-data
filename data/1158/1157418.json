Due to his distant relationship with his father, Pedro doesn't fully master Mallorcan as a language. He turns to the works of Damià Huguet to remember his father, as only his poems can fill the void left by his death. The poet's words transport Pedro to his childhood and his roots, even though many of the words are unknown to him, despite them belonging to his language.  This becomes the driving force behind the protagonist's search for his own identity, his origins, what it means to be a man, father-son relationships, collective identity, and \"mallorquinness\". Pedro constantly questions the emotions stirred by Huguet's poetry, and, most importantly, who he is and where he belongs.","popularity":0.748,"poster_path":"/gjp2h31q1D1cnQr5yqHe6iSec3X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Born Films","origin_country":""},{"id":204982,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sealand Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guaret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Mas","original_name":"Pedro Mas","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/7cKGEHFBnRHLAQeu1n2nGuEFtQq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pedro Mas","credit_id":"64c3f4d7d861af00e2b2f14b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Busquets Martorell","original_name":"Joan Busquets Martorell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c62f23cadb6b01066d5939","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3172547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josep Alorda Roca","original_name":"Josep Alorda Roca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xQ1FjxMRvIKY26IzF3QJq1EN4Ef.jpg","credit_id":"64c3f546ec370c013967a765","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carles Bover Martínez","original_name":"Carles Bover Martínez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3f55ad861af00aca84b4b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3172547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josep Alorda Roca","original_name":"Josep Alorda Roca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xQ1FjxMRvIKY26IzF3QJq1EN4Ef.jpg","credit_id":"64c3f537eec4f30125a396e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pere Campaner","original_name":"Pere Campaner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3f56eec370c00c56aa63e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3172547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josep Alorda Roca","original_name":"Josep Alorda Roca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xQ1FjxMRvIKY26IzF3QJq1EN4Ef.jpg","credit_id":"64c3f52743250f01455b2123","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28493588","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":863,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1dSl2Bk9tjX2sBPfhu15L4tLRM8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1533}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/gjp2h31q1D1cnQr5yqHe6iSec3X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":165601,"name":"self identity"},{"id":277762,"name":"cine doméstico"},{"id":281397,"name":"footage"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":302435,"name":"poesía"},{"id":315246,"name":"identidad"},{"id":321118,"name":"damià huguet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
