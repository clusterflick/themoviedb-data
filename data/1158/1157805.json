Come to think of it, something similar happened in the past. It was a letter to someone who lived in my house. He must have been a tenant like me, so he might be receiving a mail delivered incorrectly like me somewhere. By the time the mail piled up and the name became familiar, it occurred to me to write a letter to the person. To the person who shared the same space as me, the person who saw what I see, the person who was the owner of the trace I lived in.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sHXH6REzvnWZLwouetNZSuGcOeV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter to You Who Used to Live in My House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeon Junehyuck","original_name":"Jeon Junehyuck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c5460963aad2020d090b4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1337,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sHXH6REzvnWZLwouetNZSuGcOeV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":899}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
