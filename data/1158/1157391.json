His insistence on the gargantuan timescale of linking life to the next millennium emerges from people who knew him. Remarkable as well for showing the unknown backstage of temple architecture.  Nishioka, known as \"the last temple carpenter,\" handled the major Showa-era repairs of Horyuji temple, and in 1990 was at the scene of the reconstruction work for Yakushi temple.","popularity":0.8275,"poster_path":"/rFwyrJyrsy4qKFMNw7OayQDf5nd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uzumasa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Artisan's Legacy: Tsunekazu Nishioka","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Oni ni kike: Miyadaiku Nishioka Tsunekazu no yuigon","type":"original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsunekazu Nishioka","original_name":"Tsunekazu Nishioka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64c3df9b43250f00c99fdd5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renji Ishibashi","original_name":"石橋蓮司","popularity":0.5859,"profile_path":"/n3mXTldssi3Dm0H9cfYvrKpfE86.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64c3dfe7eec4f300e70a0f8c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yûji Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎佑次","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3df5faf6e9400ae3caa57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184882,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Byonyan Paku","original_name":"朴柄陽","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3dfbad861af01390a1c29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kazuya Sahara","original_name":"佐原一哉","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3e038eec4f300aeef2926","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923270,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nobukazu Uekusa","original_name":"植草信和","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3dfccc9044c00c76c2f13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184888,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hiroyuki Imaoka","original_name":"今岡裕之","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c3e04aec370c00ad51cce0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5040792,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shuhei Tada","original_name":"多田修平","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672919173940c1202ff7da7f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2251433","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rFwyrJyrsy4qKFMNw7OayQDf5nd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":659}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33496,"name":"construction"},{"id":180505,"name":"buddhist temple"},{"id":191188,"name":"wood carving"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
