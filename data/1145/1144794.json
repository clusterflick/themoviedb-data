The plot oscillates between mundane detail and highly saturated shenanigans, reiterated by a bazaar soundtrack that punctuates atmospheric compositions with pop music. “Yeilders Path” is presented on the ceiling of a black-curtained room, positioned with the same perspective of much of it’s subject matter. A large futon and theater seats nestled between fake plants provide an inviting viewing environment.","popularity":0.0615,"poster_path":"/qWw5ffRIkviU5GwYGD4nTWeiSgn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yielders Path","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murphy Maxwell","original_name":"Murphy Maxwell","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mark Trade","credit_id":"6499cf0a955c650124294d86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65f8a78088c6590163514a96","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"6499ced062f335012747737f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"6499cedc6f43ec01399b43e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998404,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rhett LaRue","original_name":"Rhett LaRue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kRQzcuJMYes7taq1Gs8NavQ3af5.jpg","credit_id":"6499ceecb344090139856be3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lizzie Fitch","original_name":"Lizzie Fitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dUZ9QJ1RX2z5ehogZnDVbs6ZsKM.jpg","credit_id":"6499cf16bbd0b001252bf1ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"6499cf1fb344090139856bf6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5866340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wD6qKKOpE7cZJujmVOJwsuYfrql.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1640}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":856,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qWw5ffRIkviU5GwYGD4nTWeiSgn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
