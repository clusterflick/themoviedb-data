As more images of the 3 valleys of Monção are revealed, we are taken on a journey through testimonials of the daily life of other people who inhabit this territory. What has changed? What remains the same? Trilogia dos Vales is an ode to the simplicity of rural life, while at the same time tracing a portrait of populations living in isolated territories in Portugal. In addition to the testimonies, the images are accompanied by music played and recorded live at the first presentation of the film concert.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trilogy of Valleys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Moreira","original_name":"Rita Moreira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"64988f0862f335010818cae0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nuno Alves","original_name":"Nuno Alves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64988e9bb3440900c54f8e02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Barreiro","original_name":"Filipe Barreiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64988eab955c650124289d19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Barreiro","original_name":"Filipe Barreiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64988ebcc8f3c400ad87c06f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Barreiro","original_name":"Filipe Barreiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64988ec26f43ec00e27e267a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Manuel dos Reis","original_name":"Manuel dos Reis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64988eeb6f43ec00ac3b853e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
