James Earl Jones reviews the brief life of JFK. His triumphs. His failures. His inpiration and contribution to our history. The story is told through previously unseen and rare video and home movies. and by many people who were there, ordinary people. The story is built around the exclusive historic videotape from WFAA, the dallas station whose studios are located so near the infamouse \"grassy knoll\" where the President was shot. We see the events as they happened, from JFK's arrival in Dallas to his funeral in Washington four days later.","popularity":0.3458,"poster_path":"/uLp0R38Ao0ItbIaEQ7E51DttUzs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"11-22-63: The Day the Nation Cried","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Earl Jones","original_name":"James Earl Jones","popularity":4.0266,"profile_path":"/oqMPIsXrl9SZkRfIKN08eFROmH6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64a19a19d5191f011cac243d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142354,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruce Halford","original_name":"Bruce Halford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a199c1d5191f00ff8c4cdf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Halford","original_name":"Bruce Halford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a199add5191f01393e9edf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1135,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uLp0R38Ao0ItbIaEQ7E51DttUzs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
