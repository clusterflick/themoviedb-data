The movement involved artists and designers who created unique, oftentimes handmade, and extremely limited edition pieces. Art et Industrie was a transitional moment for art and design in the United States. This documentary strives to encapsulate the bittersweet meaning that Art et Industrie had in the lives of these revolutionary artists who, as they age and juggle their jobs and family needs, continue to pursue the same dreams they had 37 years ago. Art et Industrie attempts to document a vital part of the 80s New York art scene. The Art et Industrie movement was the first of its kind in the United States, and it continues to have a tremendous influence in the global art world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7o6gw6otIU7Yx9GoNoZb2AgJVsO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Art et Industrie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132236,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Smash Lefunk","original_name":"Smash Lefunk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b78562f3350127476ad8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132236,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Smash Lefunk","original_name":"Smash Lefunk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b795bbd0b000e73076e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pandora Castelli","original_name":"Pandora Castelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b751b3440900c55033a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pandora Castelli","original_name":"Pandora Castelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b7a5b34409013985634a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pandora Castelli","original_name":"Pandora Castelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b7d5b344090139856368","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132237,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rick Burns","original_name":"Rick Burns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b7c662f335014629c257","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4132236,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Smash Lefunk","original_name":"Smash Lefunk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6499b76a955c6500e6605a74","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8726466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1277,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7o6gw6otIU7Yx9GoNoZb2AgJVsO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
