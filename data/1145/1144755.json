The Japanese archipelago, seen from 3,000 meters above the ground, stretches from Okinawa through the mainland to Hokkaido. It seems the beautiful coral reefs of the South Island clearly depict the sea route, and the huge mountain massif and wilderness in the northernmost part reflect the depth of climate and culture since the Jomon period in a panoramic view.  The mountain surfaces of Takachiho, which forms the home of Japanese mythology, burns red, and Hidemine Fuji is expanding its base with a wild sense of volume. The illusion of a vast ancient city rises, and the old battlefields of the Sengoku period and castle towns of the early modern period pass through a time tunnel and come back to life one after another.  Even so, what about the development of precise urban spaces that correspond to the miniaturization of rural areas?","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":"/A36FeFnmTszj3Wa1YC4Lj6HzwSt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1778,"logo_path":"/b5rT6VbYza3LyfltCmz1OcqzWJM.png","name":"dentsu","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Japan Profile from the Sky Part 1: South to North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4136239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shozo Fujita","original_name":"Shozo Fujita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649cad178289a001396799c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3387720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tsutomu Yamashita","original_name":"Tsutomu Yamashita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649caebd8289a000ff1438fa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":881,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A36FeFnmTszj3Wa1YC4Lj6HzwSt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
