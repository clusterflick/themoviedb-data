The documentary is a story of a little boy who describes experiences and meetings with his aunt, a nun working in the Institute of Social Care under Kunětická hora in Bohemia. It is one of the first attempts to reveal the life of a nun in the difficult environment of mentally handicapped children. Faith in God gives this woman the strength to help and guide children to find themselves. In 1970, this film was sentenced to stay in the archive for almost 20 years.","popularity":0.2111,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Štúdio krátkych filmov Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Aunt Vincencia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1280673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julius Matula","original_name":"Julius Matula","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64996f8b62f33501081951f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1831977,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jozef Grussmann","original_name":"Jozef Grussmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64996f98b344090139853d6e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1280673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julius Matula","original_name":"Julius Matula","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64996f906f43ec00e27ea45d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617844,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eduard Palček","original_name":"Eduard Palček","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64996fa96f43ec011c6335a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037321,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alois Fišárek","original_name":"Alois Fišárek","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/n607eBEGD0KrAqFdLM9T7rNdz97.jpg","credit_id":"64996fa0bbd0b000adf15365","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
