He is a mixture of ancient Maya beliefs and Christianity. The movie concentrates on the people who surround Maximón with their strong personalities, opinions and faith. The documentary gives us a rare view into the rituals and fiestas honoring Maximón. The cult of Maximón is flourishing because he performs miracles. He is also feared and despised because he is used to cast curses that can result in death. Ultimately, Maximón transcends the duality of good and evil, reflecting the Maya cosmovision in which everything in the universe co-exists.","popularity":0.6921,"poster_path":"/9C6R7Bsoo1D5B3FGdyDTtQczmMy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ajax Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"}],"release_date":"2014-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"As there is light, so there is darkness.","title":"Maximón: Devil or Saint","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","title":"Maximón - Devil or Saint","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Flanagan","original_name":"Robert Flanagan","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/1fLc4rb1jXNh3tPtnH1mqllfoOm.jpg","credit_id":"60da70f405f9cf002b6f83d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3101218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","original_name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8ICOUmzKlFNkayhH2xWg5W9XNyQ.jpg","credit_id":"60da713d2716710021a4972e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Flanagan","original_name":"Robert Flanagan","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/1fLc4rb1jXNh3tPtnH1mqllfoOm.jpg","credit_id":"60da7155d11e0e0047048368","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140099,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sergio Villatoro","original_name":"Sergio Villatoro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60da71a5cc277c0080df742c","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Diamond","original_name":"Joel Diamond","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/mH9TBRdPCBeK8w57AqwB88DrZzq.jpg","credit_id":"60da71d0d11e0e00763abaa1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3101218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","original_name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8ICOUmzKlFNkayhH2xWg5W9XNyQ.jpg","credit_id":"60da711c25b9550073afa43a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3101218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","original_name":"Suzan Al-Doghachi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8ICOUmzKlFNkayhH2xWg5W9XNyQ.jpg","credit_id":"66d503ab147f47aa6a6593d7","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4007284","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"ajaxfilms","instagram_id":"ajaxfilms","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCljL1nRxMusinc78eZd2o3r7OT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/98nWQdQhm1ovE9rSkB0q7qViZ3s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ATDwDlxjp2E1EtbBsEkYWcTI36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x6AmNVpDeHo7qQpBWNbTZfGho8k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lpjpBeSRnOaVimyQJeXOu6zzAuo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9C6R7Bsoo1D5B3FGdyDTtQczmMy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2343,"name":"magic"},{"id":5566,"name":"maya civilization"},{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":11326,"name":"shaman"},{"id":15222,"name":"central america"},{"id":18256,"name":"spiritual"},{"id":161207,"name":"catholicism"},{"id":163092,"name":"guatemala"},{"id":193835,"name":"synchronicity"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":265672,"name":"maya"},{"id":282084,"name":"san simon"},{"id":282563,"name":"maximón - devil or saint"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Maximón - Santo o Diablo (official trailer)","key":"vB3kE5hP9b0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-22T02:14:29.000Z","id":"621448f120e6a500684887cd"}]}}}
