Beau uses his intimate knowledge of running to compare his former self to his bean-self, logging lacklustre training for an ultramarathon that he plans on running during the final day of the experiment. Epiphanies are had, saddles are blazed, and genuine insight emerges from what is strangely appealing day-to-day of mediocrity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rYTlyohtZkKPi1gCSHdcjlpkrC7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Inspired by a half-page scene in John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat, where a family of poor, super healthy kids eat an almost exclusive bean diet, Beau decides to do much the same thing.","title":"The Human Bean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2633453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Miles","original_name":"Beau Miles","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/vrb3Uc6pxqMz8ZfYp2el0RB6zYK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60db4eb7dbf14400468a9ee4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140877,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helen Barclay","original_name":"Helen Barclay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"613a84e7d38b580088ab7e8c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140880,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brett Williams","original_name":"Brett Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db4f313fe160002bfb802e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140865,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Dobson","original_name":"James Dobson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db4f410e5aba002970a9d6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitch Drummond","original_name":"Mitch Drummond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db4ef33fe160007d056f96","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140877,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helen Barclay","original_name":"Helen Barclay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db4f2117c443004614d231","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140881,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sally Barclay","original_name":"Sally Barclay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db4f4c63a695005efa2929","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2633453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Miles","original_name":"Beau Miles","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/vrb3Uc6pxqMz8ZfYp2el0RB6zYK.jpg","credit_id":"60db4ed23fe160005be3970d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitch Drummond","original_name":"Mitch Drummond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db4ee425b955002ca9979b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2633453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Miles","original_name":"Beau Miles","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/vrb3Uc6pxqMz8ZfYp2el0RB6zYK.jpg","credit_id":"60db4ec9b339030046bbd22c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rYTlyohtZkKPi1gCSHdcjlpkrC7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
