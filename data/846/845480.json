She was admired for her dancing by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. She was loved by the world famous American poet Robert Lowell. She was the first to introduce sacred dance into church services in many different countries around the world. She has learned to cross freely the cultural boundaries, feeling equally at home both in Eastern and Western dance traditions. Born in Latvia, she has spent her life in different parts of the world and the camera traces her in the film (from India in 70ies where she had been renowned as \"Vijaya\", to New York, Greece, and Latvia today).  The film is as colorful as her life: loud and happy like the feelings aroused by her splendid performance, deep and unknowable like her inner world, and sad, quiet and calm like loneliness itself?","popularity":0.1367,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Devini","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2004-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is a story about a woman who seemingly has always been victorious against all the difficulties; but, when you look closer, there is sadness lingering in her heart and tears in her eyes.","title":"Vijaya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2479239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vija Vetra","original_name":"Vija Vetra","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6229c7c4770700006e2ec877","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ināra Kolmane","original_name":"Ināra Kolmane","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/74CJ7nfEt9bB4Q4ax4xkUaum6Fx.jpg","credit_id":"60d8c7ec85b105007e83b56b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896758,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Kalniņš","original_name":"Aivars Kalniņš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8c80fdf86a80075d3fda2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761345,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uldis Millers","original_name":"Uldis Millers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8c825df86a80046d891b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896648,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ainārs Paukšēns","original_name":"Ainārs Paukšēns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8c83566a7c3007f24c8dc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","original_name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8c84fd11e0e002ba4102d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ināra Kolmane","original_name":"Ināra Kolmane","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/74CJ7nfEt9bB4Q4ax4xkUaum6Fx.jpg","credit_id":"60d8c7e266a7c3005eaf5ec7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","original_name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8c846b7fbbd003005ed74","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ināra Kolmane","original_name":"Ināra Kolmane","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/74CJ7nfEt9bB4Q4ax4xkUaum6Fx.jpg","credit_id":"60d8c7fcdf86a8005e7b252b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","original_name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8c85d0b7316005dd6c5e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2350477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nora Ikstena","original_name":"Nora Ikstena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e48361258823002d8a6b27","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0965235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
