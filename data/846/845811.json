Alongside questions around the intersections of negative affect and political agency, the work problematises notions around upward mobility that the field of contemporary art both produces and presupposes. Deploying an essayistic approach, the video work reflects upon the manifold meanings of distance in both its subjective and social senses.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":"/wSJ43ySm5efQFncMYndHHJhiYQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Capacity For Adequate Anger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","original_name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"60dab208955c6500458e44bd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","original_name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dab1e405f9cf00444252aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","original_name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dab1f70e5aba005da38c31","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15210642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vesa0I3DHymNJv0uieoGVDckBZX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSJ43ySm5efQFncMYndHHJhiYQP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1125}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Capacity for Adequate Anger (2021) - Vika Kirchenbauer - HD Trailer","key":"Y1DPSdN72Rk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-17T23:50:22.000Z","id":"61452d8c55c9260029e6261b"}]}}}
