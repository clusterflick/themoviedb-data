Her young lovers were also her victims, and she had them murdered to avoid detection. Such was the fate that awaited Philippe d'Aulnay, who had barely arrived in Paris and who, in one night, had gone from the arms of the sovereign to the bottom of the Seine. What the queen doesn't know is that among his companions in debauchery that night was a certain Buridan. An adventurer, ready to do anything to conquer money and power - including blackmailing the Queen of France... This is the beginning of a merciless war between these two beings, with one spectacular turn of events after another, horrifying revelations and the crossfire of hatred and love.","popularity":0.2007,"poster_path":"/uRj8AII8UevAjJnQ2oi5dTkax4H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Patrimoine Concept","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Tour de Nesle","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jézabel Carpi","original_name":"Jézabel Carpi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/qOznW2nu2CT6enfjSXyNZjtkAC5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60db30b625b955002ca948b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noël Herpe","original_name":"Noël Herpe","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60db30bd25b9550046ba8c17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baudouin d'Huart","original_name":"Baudouin d'Huart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60db30d1880551002d1dfeb8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Dreyfus","original_name":"Arthur Dreyfus","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60db30dd25b9550046ba8c9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Wursten","original_name":"Axel Wursten","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":"/4IqKJJIBGNozx5HdYFxuFoFqVlf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60db30e83fe160005be34467","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Paret","original_name":"Thierry Paret","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60db30f463a695002f935ff9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Chenille","original_name":"Vincent Chenille","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60db310717c4430074a1e47d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Clerc","original_name":"Thomas Clerc","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60db310e3fe160002bfb32e1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michka Assayas","original_name":"Michka Assayas","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60db311717c443002d402804","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2120630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Hameury","original_name":"Benjamin Hameury","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"60db31220b7316007d1eba3e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noël Herpe","original_name":"Noël Herpe","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60db306917c443002d402684","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14852752","wikidata_id":"Q107561043","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uRj8AII8UevAjJnQ2oi5dTkax4H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2022-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
