As a globalized world grows into fruition the mixing of cultures, science, and religion has left a void where honest ignorant certainty filled in the past. Belief systems are challenged, and it seems all that is left is the individual experience. Did those who came before us understand and hold something that the modern world has sacrificed in the honor of progress? A young man partakes on a journey alone across North America looking to see if there was a memory, or existence of that sacrifice left. Driving 14,000 miles in 64 days, conducting 50 interviews ranging from billionaires to poor farmers, and members of Gen Z to Centenarians. An answer is found, perhaps it is wrong, but that is for you to decide.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/jQ5ahoGtXdmmbm7BfzaZ2fSEyk5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Each Person Has Their Own Question","title":"14000 Miles","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3026511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjorn Stickle","original_name":"Bjorn Stickle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8e428924ce50046363c89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12575896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jQ5ahoGtXdmmbm7BfzaZ2fSEyk5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
