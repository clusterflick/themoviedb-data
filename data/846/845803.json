The second directorial work of Hữu Đức (who had by then appeared in a number of early Vietnamese animation project, often responsible for the art), Flying Dream marked ‘the maturity phase’ of Vietnamese animation in general and doll-based stop-motion works in particular.  Flying Dream also bears the spirit of 1970s Eastern European animation through hazy spaces and colours floating freely between reality and a dream-world (created by artist Mai Long), and a score that recalls the best of psychedelic pop music of the time.","popularity":0.0456,"poster_path":"/aToyTWjppF8C8caHZ0Ml2V58oT2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vietnam Animation Studio","origin_country":"VN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giấc Mơ Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140220,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hồng Đăng","original_name":"Hồng Đăng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60daa1fa2716710021a5289b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3140218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Huu Duc","original_name":"Huu Duc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60daa14b17c4430074a12154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viet Linh","original_name":"Viet Linh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6730d7bd11b6cc0571f65c6a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1795,"iso_639_1":"vi","file_path":"/aToyTWjppF8C8caHZ0Ml2V58oT2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1205}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"vi","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Giấc mơ bay 1976| Hãng phim hoạt hình Việt Nam","key":"nbmvcdXHsJM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-11-05T11:07:47.000Z","id":"6730d6bbac970aad2a8d9db5"}]}}}
