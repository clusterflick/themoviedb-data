The work was later performed in its own right with some additions.  A powerful and poetic piece, the drama presents the lives, anxieties, regrets, fears and memories of women as they they deal with the waiting and the aftermath of a storm with all their men at sea.  Filmed in lockdown in Orkney this project has involved technology, remote rehearsal, mobile phone cameras and much more besides.  In this year of Mackay Brown's 100th birthday, it brings to life one of his early but also most powerful pieces of theatre.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Storm Watchers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann McTaggart","original_name":"Ann McTaggart","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60d7138c9979d200454581f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iona MacLeod","original_name":"Iona MacLeod","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60d713b1aa78980029d011a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Sonabend","original_name":"Holly Sonabend","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60d713e599c964002f17877c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Butler","original_name":"Vera Butler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60d7140a9979d2005d59e824","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cally Bevan","original_name":"Cally Bevan","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60d7142aaa789800451cd26f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Giles","original_name":"Lorraine Giles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60d71446ef9d720074e180ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn Copland","original_name":"Dawn Copland","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60d71465109cd00047095765","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Dean","original_name":"Eleanor Dean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60d71486109cd0004709578a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Partridge","original_name":"Jane Partridge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60d7149c25b9550073a7188e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerda Stevenson","original_name":"Gerda Stevenson","popularity":0.1966,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d714f99979d2005d59e921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137270,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Alcock","original_name":"James Alcock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d715296c0b36005e8e8a79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rob Macneacail","original_name":"Rob Macneacail","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d7155baa78980073f217b4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137271,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alasdair Nicolson","original_name":"Alasdair Nicolson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d7158833ad8f005ee14a9a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137273,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fionn McArthur","original_name":"Fionn McArthur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d7180ca1c59d002c3e41d2","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3137274,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Partridge","original_name":"Mike Partridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d7182a99c964005e73a3e7","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
