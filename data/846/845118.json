These range from Evil Ways and Black Magic Woman to the massive hits from his later Supernatural album. Santana recounts to director Jeremy Marre the abuse and struggle of his early years, the invention of Latin rock in San Francisco, his triumph at Woodstock, his involvement with jealous guru Sri Chinmoy and guitarist John McLaughlin, and the rollercoaster years that followed.  This frank and very personal depiction of a remarkable forty-year career, fuelled by his 'angels and demons', is illustrated with behind-the-scenes footage uncovered for the first time, interviews with former members of the band, producers and musicians, and many performances from the early 70s that depict his unmistakable guitar style.","popularity":0.6619,"poster_path":"/oZL0hSU6TgarxpeHzwQW4HPOkZh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Santana Story: Angels and Demons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Santana","original_name":"Carlos Santana","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/hphAanWETS2h42G7mx4QLzV2w0s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d72439109cd000470975ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McLaughlin","original_name":"John McLaughlin","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/h8dtWePO3YBVT9BhlyjeydCPZfr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d724886c0b36002ebf4cd8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Hart","original_name":"Mickey Hart","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/yNJVepbyCmZWETB1T9Wy9EXxOEj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d72498aa7898005d520157","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d724b48805510074c791f3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"60d7250b6c0b360047ce6715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"60d7252288055100457fb1aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"60d7257688055100457fb25a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oZL0hSU6TgarxpeHzwQW4HPOkZh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
