What could be a simple family chat expands to the complex dimensions of history, since his life is that of a certain destiny, first involved in the resistance, then as a major activist in the Communist Party. The two archivists widen the circle to listen to the testimonies of their mother, Svettlana, their sister, Michèle, and other witnesses, comrades in utopia: Jacques Rossi, a former Komintern agent deported to the Gulag, and Marina Vlady, who lived in the USSR in the 1930s and was the wife of the protest singer Vladimir Vyssotsky. History is filtered through conversations that do not exclude silence or questioning. – FIDMarseille","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":"/ryqHA8xdVeTK81SYeXkBFh073sM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nissim dit Max","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Nissim says Max","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Léon","original_name":"Michèle Léon","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66437f268995b0e685cb5e92","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Léon","original_name":"Pierre Léon","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/vJjWWu9Vf8jaTPcOFoyUbrLU2aB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66437f2f0caab4d340b8a481","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Léon","original_name":"Vladimir Léon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66437f3c22c31cf2416ab41f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Léon","original_name":"Max Léon","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66437f81683cbc9c7835d71d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Léon","original_name":"Svetlana Léon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66437f8ac1f00da47eb9b67d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Vlady","original_name":"Marina Vlady","popularity":0.7433,"profile_path":"/zpP7QK2DvKl9KVqqOr38P0GKXJY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66437fa569499ddb4d961b39","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Léon","original_name":"Pierre Léon","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/vJjWWu9Vf8jaTPcOFoyUbrLU2aB.jpg","credit_id":"60d71747109cd0005f79f4f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Léon","original_name":"Vladimir Léon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d7175225b955005dfb2962","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0425300","wikidata_id":"Q28494139","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ryqHA8xdVeTK81SYeXkBFh073sM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
