Do objects have powers or energies of their own? If so, can we see or feel it? While this may sound heavy and philosophical, the film is actually a lively argument between two neurotic gay men who have been together for too long. As they discuss whether or not to rid themselves of some extra junk, we watch a memory film of one of the character's childhood toy trucks being burned, and a handful of Asian film clips, meant to parody the characters' ridiculous, half understood adoption of Asian philosophy and spirituality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shinto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1355753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Achtman","original_name":"Michael Achtman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60d6bb7d6c0b36002ebed28d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.M.
