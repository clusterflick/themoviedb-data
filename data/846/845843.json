Winehouse made her TV debut on Later in 2003 with songs from her debut album Frank. Like Jools, she loved classic jazz and blues singers like Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan, and the two Londoners hit it off. Amy returned to play with Jools's Orchestra at that year's Hootenanny, to Later in 2006 for the launch of Back to Black and to that year's Hootenanny to perform Toots's Monkey Man and duet with Paul Weller.","popularity":0.4572,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amy Winehouse Tribute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Winehouse","original_name":"Amy Winehouse","popularity":0.311,"profile_path":"/7Imqp8eqt1je4kMwJrV7WfhAZnW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60dae769b33903002d68bafa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jools Holland","original_name":"Jools Holland","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/e1JATtQMNq3KM2KN8mKUw4uIOkL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60dae76e880551004588f8cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weller","original_name":"Paul Weller","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/3dOUHcW9YM9JBlkpPjdXJ1hdmON.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60dae7723fe160002bfacc59","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"60dae78adbf1440075d339db","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2011-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
