In an orgy of countrywide violence, some were intent on derailing the first free elections. Now, for the first time, those responsible for countless deaths and widespread mayhem explain how they nearly brought South Africa to its knees. 1994: The Bloody Miracle is a chilling look at what these hard men did to thwart democracy, and at how they have now made an uneasy peace with the ‘Rainbow Nation’ in their own different ways.","popularity":0.2811,"poster_path":"/uKKxVvucVxOzgJ4X2ssqjgJCE2x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boondogle Films","origin_country":"ZA"},{"id":151687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sabido Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1994: The Bloody Miracle","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kani","original_name":"John Kani","popularity":0.9522,"profile_path":"/g7tqg3q128a5O2qXMCwVnXsow9I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60dab2e9955c650074d0ccd5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1719227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meg Rickards","original_name":"Meg Rickards","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dab23b955c65005dcb81ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1719227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meg Rickards","original_name":"Meg Rickards","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dab2450e5aba007ec5ecbf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2544605,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bert Haitsma","original_name":"Bert Haitsma","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dab2513fe1600045a20e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4778754","wikidata_id":"Q115953443","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9PfEcsrW9VOhsIOMlFiVUbBTsYA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tGge1AVr9Yt3RgYjSXbL7wctt5C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.971,"height":206,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4zCGzYhqDcAw1cAYmXfV40bWxFj.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":406}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1753,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qX7H8CSa8yONMTVH4EK1ykZXedX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1169},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uKKxVvucVxOzgJ4X2ssqjgJCE2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
