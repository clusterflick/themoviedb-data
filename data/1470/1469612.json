Having experienced marginalization in Filipino culture because of their queerness, as well as in mainstream gay culture because of their race, language, and gender, the members of the group sought political empowerment and increased visibility. But above all, they sought to create a space of friendship and safety for those who found themselves suspended between cultures and identities.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Because Of You: A History Of Kilawin Kolektibo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barbara Malaran","original_name":"Barbara Malaran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68095dd2f913e66a3aee1ece","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Desireena Almoradie","original_name":"Desireena Almoradie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68095de1ac02d4407bab7e99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
