With vivid metaphors and electrifying lyrics, it portrays life as a journey of peaks and valleys, compelling listeners to rise above despair. More than just a song—it’s a revolution. It speaks to the dreamers, the warriors, and the weary, reminding them that no struggle lasts forever and that courage can move mountains. Its message transcends boundaries: Keep fighting. The world bends when you refuse to break.  Ashok Saravanan’s composition masterfully blends driving percussion, soaring vocals, and anthemic melodies to amplify the track’s fiery spirit. The powerful refrain—\"When sorrow comes, don’t stop!\"—echoes like a mantra, cementing its timeless call to perseverance.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/se3RCvaTzNr9PmY394iZ56hDjhY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-01","revenue":31,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Ulagai Maattru","title":"Ulagai Maattru","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5321000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","original_name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"lyricist","credit_id":"68087e9e15a1d5a614aabf0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5341826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashoksaravanan Micro Film","original_name":"Ashoksaravanan Micro Film","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Production","credit_id":"68087eac15a1d5a614aabf0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5321000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","original_name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Music","credit_id":"68087eba276bf64e41ab4076","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5341828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN DIGITAL VISION","original_name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN DIGITAL VISION","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Release","credit_id":"68087ec7b082db6279ee4e8b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5321000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","original_name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68086dfb142b09cecf89d49f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5321000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","original_name":"ASHOKSARAVANAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68086e10271ecb3ae089cb38","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"ta","file_path":"/z1EOtTnDVab98x84k6V0PjNcbZB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ta","file_path":"/se3RCvaTzNr9PmY394iZ56hDjhY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ta","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
