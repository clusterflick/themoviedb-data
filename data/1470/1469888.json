Every year on the same date, the brother finds himself spiraling back into the same day, unable to break free from the memory or the questions it left behind.  The discovery of his sister’s old diary becomes the spark that reopens the wound. As he reads through her words, he is pulled deeper into a distorted journey between past and present — where time loops, scenes repeat, and truth hides behind fragments of childhood innocence.  At the heart of this story lies a symbol: the pomegranate. An object of beauty, complexity, and decay, it becomes both a tool of distraction and a silent witness to the tragedy.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do you feel guilty?","title":"In ten seconds","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammed Hamami","original_name":"Mohammed Hamami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6809fb78b2b722aedf8a4b38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
