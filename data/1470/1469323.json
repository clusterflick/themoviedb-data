The film reconstructs her life and illness through interviews with historians and genealogists, a visit to the local historical society, and the newspapers from the early 1900s that sensationalized her institutionalization in graphic detail. Through speculative animation drawing from documentary material, the film reclaims Minnieâ€™s story from sensationalist public gossip imagining an alternative history for a woman who was failed by her family and society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8Bj3icFBN3bH1MoxsjNki0Les8S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild Girl of Brushvalley Township","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heather Cassano","original_name":"Heather Cassano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6808e3a8b2b722aedf8a0a6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heather Cassano","original_name":"Heather Cassano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6808e3b6c3e8e74b6deef6b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5390764,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emily Hofelich","original_name":"Emily Hofelich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6808e3c1ac02d4407bab663c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5390767,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adrianne Parent","original_name":"Adrianne Parent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6808e3cc142b09cecf89fc3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heather Cassano","original_name":"Heather Cassano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6808e3d7b2b722aedf8a0a78","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854764,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip G Anderson","original_name":"Philip G Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6808e3e8142b09cecf89fc53","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1266,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8Bj3icFBN3bH1MoxsjNki0Les8S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":844}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
