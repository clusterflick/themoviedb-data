It is a project born from a dream come true, where knowledge and experience intersect with the aim of revaluing film as a common cultural asset. It is also a metaphor for the mechanized individual who dreams; for the human being in the industrialized world who works monotonously and tirelessly while imagining, planning, and constructing a collective cosmos. It is also the reproduction of ways of being and existing, an artifact that creates a landscape constructed by human and mechanical force, leaving traces that today constitute a heritage.","popularity":0.0993,"poster_path":"/uM0Kb58Afvgr19MToUgW6lJNFlv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla","origin_country":""},{"id":260261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Museo Industrial de Metepec","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2018-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somno Automatum México Industrial 1923","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"México Industrial 1923","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5391438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Castellanos Arenas","original_name":"Mariano Castellanos Arenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680932f5f913e66a3aee15b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5391446,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cabezas de Cera","original_name":"Cabezas de Cera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68093385c96e0dcc05ee5b06","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1573,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uM0Kb58Afvgr19MToUgW6lJNFlv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1048}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
