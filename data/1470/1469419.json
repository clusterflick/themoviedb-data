They are persecuted by the Ethiopians for being Jewish and subject also to Israeli discrimination. The impoverished Falashas live in tiny, mountainous villages where the film crew found them practicing their religion in isolation, as they have done for the past 2,000 years. These Ethiopian Jews long to go to Zion, but the government will not allow them to emigrate and deals harshly with those who endeavor to escape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falasha: Agony of the Black Jews","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Raymont","original_name":"Peter Raymont","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6809091715a1d5a614aae078","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
