The cast and crew, made up of murderers and robbers, thieves and prostitutes, and no doubt a few wrongly convicted, prepared two yeas to put on a public performance of the life of Jesus Christ in the largest prison production of a Passion Play ever. CAST THE FIRST STONE is a feature documentary about the most powerful and popular story in history. In a place with little hope of freedom, where 95% of the men who enter the gates perish, the story of a man who sacrifices his life to save the wretched of the Earth, resonates deeply.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3yB45ZwKclAkCQsoGke1sDOt2un.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cast the First Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serey Kong","original_name":"Serey Kong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"68098e64ac02d4407bab84fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Williams","original_name":"Patricia Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mother Mary","credit_id":"68098e7015a1d5a614aaf993","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherie Perez","original_name":"Cherie Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Devil","credit_id":"68098e7ab2b722aedf8a3209","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Davis","original_name":"Earl Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"John","credit_id":"68098e81ac02d4407bab851d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Singleton","original_name":"Justin Singleton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"68098e8db2b722aedf8a3216","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Starr","original_name":"Sandra Starr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mary Magdalene","credit_id":"68098e9ac339fcc2a8ee0a15","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Tyler","original_name":"Gary Tyler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Director","credit_id":"68098ea7c96e0dcc05ee6e60","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Cuellar","original_name":"Nicholas Cuellar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68098dfc142b09cecf8a1da3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Stack","original_name":"Jonathan Stack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68098e0cc96e0dcc05ee6df5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392257,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Willie Campbell","original_name":"Willie Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68098e2bc96e0dcc05ee6e18","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392258,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Hutley","original_name":"Peter Hutley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68098e3ec96e0dcc05ee6e24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Stack","original_name":"Jonathan Stack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68098e4fc339fcc2a8ee0a01","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2473806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":771,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yB45ZwKclAkCQsoGke1sDOt2un.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":516}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
