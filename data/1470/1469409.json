The film unveils a poignant chapter in history when a group of Indian Sikh immigrants aboard a Japanese steamship named Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver carrying 376 passengers from India. Canada, enforcing discriminatory immigration laws, denied entry to most passengers who were of Indian descent. After two months of legal battles and protests, the ship was forced to return to India. The incident highlights racial prejudices and immigration policies of the time, symbolising a struggle for Equality and Justice.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/3O6a64wsEvRycmrU7KnWHsQi59H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Guru Nanak Jahaz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1919374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarsem Jassar","original_name":"Tarsem Jassar","popularity":0.3755,"profile_path":"/hTb2GzAar7eDdDh4TbbbhwfXO2V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"680905bc15a1d5a614aadf15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Balwinder Bullet","original_name":"Balwinder Bullet","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"680905cdc5c8035fb08ad619","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurpreet Ghuggi","original_name":"Gurpreet Ghuggi","popularity":0.2614,"profile_path":"/7ZENS2dXJ4BU3Hg6dgJwtyvEGBm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"680905dfc5c8035fb08ad626","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2312436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharan Art","original_name":"Sharan Art","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680905a5c3e8e74b6deefcb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"pa","file_path":"/3O6a64wsEvRycmrU7KnWHsQi59H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pa","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Guru Nanak Jahaz (OFFICIAL TRAILER) Komagata Maru | Tarsem Jassar | Gurpreet Ghuggi | Rel on 1st May","key":"4xPks078zY8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-18T14:20:19.000Z","id":"680905fd15a1d5a614aadf4a"}]}}}
