Café Truten has very little running water or consistent electricity and with only days to open the cafe, we watch as Meg and her helpers are pushed to their limits and pull off culinary miracles. Sweet Störy is a reminder of what is possible when just a few people set out to make their small corner of the world a better place.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/crchCWCj2zuAq5FJOG091MBoG6P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spellbound Productions
