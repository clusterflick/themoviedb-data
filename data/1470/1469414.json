Three artists who would leave behind a magnificent legacy in terms of imagination, poetry and dance. But also three modest muses: they did not often and certainly not loudly beat the drum, while their work gave every reason to do so. Wim Kayzer had asked them to draw up a provisional testament. A testament about love, suffering, sexuality, the society in which they grew old, their work, their dreams, their youth, the Second World War, liberation, death and God.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/sUDvHwbq3mlbwwSY8IcqkRXApPs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2002-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":217,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het
