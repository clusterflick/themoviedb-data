An Athens hotel, full of refugees and expatriates of all nationalities, is captured by Allied troops in the closing days of the War. British Major David Niven has been ordered to prevent a cache of weapons hidden in the hotel from falling into the hands of renegade troops. He cannot allow himself to trust anyone--not even the most innocent-looking (or attractive) of guests. Originally titled La Citta Prigioniera. Conquered City was released in English-speaking countries outside the U.S. as Captive City.","popularity":0.8687,"poster_path":"/ltkvyKb4y3xwDoG59NOI2wEr39a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galatea Film","origin_country":""},{"id":52586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maxima Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lux Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":9266,"logo_path":"/lRinQ7scVye5N8qkUIoCB4QXbRh.png","name":"American International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conquered City","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Captive City","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La ciudad cautiva","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Conquered City","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Niven","original_name":"David Niven","popularity":1.1013,"profile_path":"/ioW2DU6T2HPvTdqUSaLLQmGPb38.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Major Peter Whitfield","credit_id":"53adcae4c3a3682edf001cba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea Massari","original_name":"Lea Massari","popularity":0.4243,"profile_path":"/8H3v68W09PB469Rdlgnu4bprhbY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lelia Mendores","credit_id":"53adcaf9c3a3682edb001ef4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Gazzara","original_name":"Ben Gazzara","popularity":0.7669,"profile_path":"/eGvi9AtDsxB3HYarc3hB512R0Gn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Captain George Stubbs","credit_id":"53adcb0ec3a3682ed8001df9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Rocca","original_name":"Daniela Rocca","popularity":0.2147,"profile_path":"/c207VWhy4sAEPTdJ1dsIVXCx8GU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doushka","credit_id":"53adcb1dc3a3682ef1001dff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Balsam","original_name":"Martin Balsam","popularity":0.9971,"profile_path":"/2j4LJJfTPQtvnjp8LfSGOvWFATO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joseph Feinberg","credit_id":"53adcb2dc3a3682ee2001f08","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Craig","original_name":"Michael Craig","popularity":0.9173,"profile_path":"/uJcPCgWxNkJPY07DtO2bHtjpF5m.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Captain Robert Elliott","credit_id":"53adcb41c3a3682eee001e06","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clelia Matania","original_name":"Clelia Matania","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/p365ABRonRfxadOpHpgEVorYrVP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Climedes","credit_id":"53adcb58c3a3682ee2001f0b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulio Bosetti","original_name":"Giulio Bosetti","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/e27cpb23DH7QBWZzlpWRSz3KGzy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narriman","credit_id":"53adcb6bc3a3682ee6001d9f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percy Herbert","original_name":"Percy Herbert","popularity":0.2492,"profile_path":"/wfyliApDtqvOxLh35Ijj5yyg8Uf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sgt.
