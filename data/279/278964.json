Pasolini was best known to Americans for his film The Gospel According to St. Matthew. However, in his native Italy, he was at least as well known for his writing and poetry as for his filmmaking. In the first episode, Pasolini (Marco Cavicchioli) waxes poetic about the beauty of young men during a visit to Sicily. The second and more interesting segment concerns a meeting with a young man who visits Pasolini thinking that though he is an old has-been, Pasolini may be able to do him a favor. Pasolini twigs to the boy's intentions, and a sparring session ensues. The final episode shows him picking up a young man at Rome's train station and the events that led to his beating death in 1975.","popularity":0.4715,"poster_path":"/ez2hrz3vBWRcdn382EKnFTOkYl8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nerolio","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Cavicchioli","original_name":"Marco Cavicchioli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f049c3a3682dbf01d9b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Sardo","original_name":"Lucia Sardo","popularity":0.1643,"profile_path":"/qsASDJIGVSOMXb0EX0Bl8aSwlO9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f0529251410b4d01621d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Crivello","original_name":"Vincenzo Crivello","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/AoImnkRcitkbdn9Vjw5Fl5bVETj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f060c3a3686316018653","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piera Degli Esposti","original_name":"Piera Degli Esposti","popularity":0.2444,"profile_path":"/r3r14DNxCWJ5SjqaaQbF4QnjhqL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f06dc3a3682dbf01d9db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Mirabella","original_name":"Franco Mirabella","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f0770e0a26540c016714","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauro Lenares","original_name":"Mauro Lenares","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f0860e0a26540c016724","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Lazzaro","original_name":"Salvatore Lazzaro","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/9ObTJY72LODymdAvTvmB1cIBYpt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a84f093c3a36862e1017704","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1398286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Nicolosi","original_name":"Maurizio Nicolosi","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/n05D2oxaL4BG116ejrBZlBeIgWY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Street boy","credit_id":"664e391e61c3cfb5b06399df","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126973,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aurelio Grimaldi","original_name":"Aurelio Grimaldi","popularity":0.1921,"profile_path":"/9ovIS7HUBYadMcVMqfsQFBelbnf.jpg","credit_id":"5a84f0049251410a1f016f31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0117164","wikidata_id":"Q3874818","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7XrQ17adNPg7JbWV2GJwQDCByPY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ez2hrz3vBWRcdn382EKnFTOkYl8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":314187,"name":"gay director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
