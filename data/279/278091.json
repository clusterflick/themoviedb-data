London Rock and Roll Show begins with excerpts from numerous \"warm-up\" performers shown singing either covers of 1950s hits, or original tunes, including a performance by Screaming Lord Sutch that threatens to end the concert prematurely when he brings a stripper on stage.  The main concert segment begins with Bo Diddley and continues with a string of other major performers including Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Bill Haley and His Comets. The concert ends with an extended performance by Chuck Berry, who at the time was enjoying major chart success in Britain and the US with his \"My Ding-a-Ling\" (although he does not perform that song in this film). Mick Jagger also appears in several non-musical interludes in which he is interviewed about the performers.","popularity":0.8255,"poster_path":"/lQQJrJQIfTbc86jx904nBMIzlbl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The London Rock and Roll Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Diddley","original_name":"Bo Diddley","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":"/wEvWkvFJU7DAl74d6mvZJDv6ceq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d0648569251410c6ab97109","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Lee Lewis","original_name":"Jerry Lee Lewis","popularity":0.2417,"profile_path":"/lHhqHmZRaqhxYp4ah7pq3PLojYK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d06488892514104c4bb722d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Little Richard","original_name":"Little Richard","popularity":0.2748,"profile_path":"/1JKKUNsQLHORat0YxqDYyQeydhS.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d0648b1c3a3684adb2b3d14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Berry","original_name":"Chuck Berry","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/9faTPqWt3cBmQZWfB16REh1jUwl.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d0648c6c3a36877db215552","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Haley","original_name":"Bill Haley","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/5VN7LnCpmIxVxXwGJk36IGGle8C.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6726e44b5af29e88553aefc0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jagger","original_name":"Mick Jagger","popularity":0.6912,"profile_path":"/r1uFIYnBCDhIlqNbiTS4nDrjHrl.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6726e470cdead30fbdb50a9b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Clifton","original_name":"Peter Clifton","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/xYFkb5jgO10LHmI7sWFNbDRwg6U.jpg","credit_id":"5d06472dc3a36877db2150c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Clifton","original_name":"Peter Clifton","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/xYFkb5jgO10LHmI7sWFNbDRwg6U.jpg","credit_id":"5d0647bdc3a368753f1f66cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Schwalm","original_name":"Thomas Schwalm","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0647d50e0a261fbbd80697","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0217627","wikidata_id":"Q7748060","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lQQJrJQIfTbc86jx904nBMIzlbl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d1xdU1DVzUsLWpNknRVVA4TxwPq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
