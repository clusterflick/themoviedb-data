In celebration of both music and images, the Houston Symphony has commissioned a high definition visual presentation to accompany the live performance of \"The Planets\". Produced by celebrated filmmaker Duncan Copp, \"The Planets - An HD Odyssey\" beautifully marries the latest images returned from planetary spacecraft with Holst's music to provide a mesmerizing spectacle. Disc one contains the film accompanied by a newly recorded soundtrack by the Houston Symphony and the Women of the Houston Symphony Chorus. Disc two contains a behind- the- scenes, making of documentary with an in- depth interview with Music Director Hans Graf and interviews with leading planetary scientists.","popularity":0.0736,"poster_path":"/mZJXAHvdKmomZldVW0e9nDKvggF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"featuring Hans Graf and the Houston Symphony Orchestra","title":"The Planets: An HD Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Houston Symphony & Music Director Hans Graf Present THE PLANETS - AN HD ODYSSEY","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334660,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hans Graf","original_name":"Hans Graf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"53aca669c3a3682ed8000591","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1169,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mZJXAHvdKmomZldVW0e9nDKvggF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Venus-The Bringer of Peace","key":"LJBeKpMugyg","published_at":"2009-11-30T23:16:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53acadd80e0a2659790007f3"}]}}}
