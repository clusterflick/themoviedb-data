An extensive collection of exotic masks is hanging on the walls while the night watchman makes his rounds. But not for long: the masks are waiting for the moment when they can reveal their imposing selves to the viewer. A collection of masks from different parts of the world shows its true face: shocking, charming or sinister. Max de Haas brings the faces to life through his camera-eye. Impressive light-and-dark effects and a chaotic music track enable the masques to tell their own stories, even when nobody is wearing them.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visie Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1952-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maskerage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max de Haas","original_name":"Max de Haas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ac4a440e0a2621610001e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334572,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lien d'Oliveyra","original_name":"Lien d'Oliveyra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ac4a7c0e0a26216d0001ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334573,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Prosper Dekeukeleire","original_name":"Prosper Dekeukeleire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ac4acc0e0a26215d00020c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003228,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Schaeffer","original_name":"Pierre Schaeffer","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/p2DHcwdHmbBPNkXX9waKJO7oHru.jpg","credit_id":"53ac4b260e0a262165000229","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (Cannes)","release_date":"1952-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
