Centring on two men -- Frank DeMartini and Pablo Ortiz -- we hear the extraordinary story of how their remarkable acts of heroism, selflessness, and courage saved the lives of over 75 people and touched many more. We also hear from the survivors themselves, their first-hand accounts of what it was like to be at the centre of this tragic day.  And through archival footage and dramatic recreations we relive their chilling moments of being stranded on the upper floors of the North Tower and their race against time to survive.","popularity":0.3509,"poster_path":"/9bD7Jc6LEPM2HekoSGvQLQqebWR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How the bravery of two men in the World Trade Center's North Tower changed the lives of countless people on 9/11.","title":"9/11: Heroes of the 88th Floor","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040643,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Barker","original_name":"Simon Barker","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bde353fa40460094a760b0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1526055,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Organ","original_name":"Steve Organ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bde35f5be00e007c5a5817","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Quinn","original_name":"James Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592a54b19251413b4505a3a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3685094,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Wright","original_name":"Chris Wright","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6694d0b351b5173f3f660bf6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2042436","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":882,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/woadQYSOYp3PtrfIOa4AAjym0tH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1569}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9bD7Jc6LEPM2HekoSGvQLQqebWR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1701,"name":"hero"},{"id":161304,"name":"9/11"},{"id":161306,"name":"world trade center"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
