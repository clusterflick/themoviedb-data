He spends his days at the club of his childhood friend, Adi, where he plays cards for money. It is springtime. He meets Dina, an old friend of Adi. They quickly become close, start playing as a team, and move in together. One evening, Ron loses all his money at the tables, gets drunk and is thrown out by Adi’s bodyguards. Dina takes advantage of the turmoil to steal from Adi. She convinces Ron to skip town. The two hide out in a fishing village. It is autumn. Ron and Dina discover that they know nothing about each another. They are strangers who can’t so much as look into each other’s eyes much less tell each other the truth.","popularity":0.1873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2008-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perpetuum Mobile","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktorija Kuodytė","original_name":"Viktorija Kuodytė","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/6k6PyyzdWpnfPO9TNuERftXkIdi.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53a711770e0a261442004142","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":482258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Donatas Šimukauskas","original_name":"Donatas Šimukauskas","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/lNmMTOJb4RePq3KOpYP7tSxTkmt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53a711b50e0a26143f0044e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2256181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julija Goyd","original_name":"Julija Goyd","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/qBJFEFd02gChjNb1JcxJ8NP65gA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dina","credit_id":"5c7e6276925141277d16b124","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1339348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dainius Gavenonis","original_name":"Dainius Gavenonis","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/sXUAeLGj5jhHQIDPcfghVmDHRMQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ron","credit_id":"5c7e62910e0a2643105a0fc9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341431,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonas Vaitkus","original_name":"Jonas Vaitkus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wL1NiXNxSU24JZKB3bgzmpnCCBk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7e62a30e0a2642fe5a083a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramūnas Cicėnas","original_name":"Ramūnas Cicėnas","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/kf2loV5IJVwfv6MnHwyHNh1irAU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Adi","credit_id":"5c7e62b9925141276316a8ce","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valdas Navasaitis","original_name":"Valdas Navasaitis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a711f10e0a26143c00403f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valdas Navasaitis","original_name":"Valdas Navasaitis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a712310e0a2614360041e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223317,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladas Naudžius","original_name":"Vladas Naudžius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7e63000e0a2642fe5a0861","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927436,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","original_name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/pw94GSlRoD9G7BJAfVragQAekpT.jpg","credit_id":"5c7e62e0925141276f16b4f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1444324","wikidata_id":"Q16469352","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Perpetuum mobile - trailer","key":"I3Zvg3m_z8E","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-03T09:04:49.000Z","id":"5c7e6241c3a3684e9bd178db"}]}}}
