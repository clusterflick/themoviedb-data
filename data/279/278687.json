It features music from his studio album, Mandala, and music from his original score for Oliver Stone's movie, Heaven and Earth.  Resonant with exotic Japanese instrumentation along with the more familiar guitar, flute and drums, it shimmers one minute and rumbles the next by turns soothing and stirring, rhythmic and dramatic, yet surprising intimate.  It is a unforgettable event with contrasts that takes its cue from nature and spirit drawing refrains of the East and West together.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/pfkV3OVfrWbnORB4J1OvdfoRyhe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Domo Music Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kitaro: An Enchanted Evening","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kitaro","original_name":"Kitaro","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/4XhwcCD8zEA9bJt4OM2AzhRFwMT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53ab33bc0e0a267619000417","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff McElroy","original_name":"Jeff McElroy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"66ccb09b7b8be19d805f1ddb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Slave","original_name":"Art Slave","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Design","credit_id":"66ccb0a741ddccb7fc3edc55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshi Shimada","original_name":"Yoshi Shimada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"66ccb0b2b7e2cb383ed85b49","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angus Clark","original_name":"Angus Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"66ccb0bb9f1d6d4b383d29ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Dentino","original_name":"Diana Dentino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"66ccb0c5237fc2de85329ee4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Heffner","original_name":"Keith Heffner","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"66ccb0d6eca454a6760d5b57","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DICK ZIMMERMAN","original_name":"DICK ZIMMERMAN","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Percussion","credit_id":"66ccb0e7acca468aaf0ec9d9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nawng Khechong","original_name":"Nawng Khechong","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"66ccb0f277b01ea61b207029","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenza Ponce","original_name":"Lorenza Ponce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Violin","credit_id":"66ccb0fb77b01ea61b207033","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Dorfman","original_name":"Stanley Dorfman","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ab92d60e0a267616000ff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eiichi Naito","original_name":"Eiichi Naito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ab33f80e0a26762500047a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22637,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Flattery","original_name":"Paul Flattery","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ab92fd0e0a267622000f4b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0251775","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pfkV3OVfrWbnORB4J1OvdfoRyhe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
