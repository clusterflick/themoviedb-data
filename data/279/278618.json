The film was shot in the remote mountainous region of Ganh Son — a gruelling production location that involved transporting cameras and equipment by cattle carts. Rich in mythological associations and striking desolate landscapes, Devil’s Mark also features the first scene of complete nudity in a Vietnamese film.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil's Mark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duong Don","original_name":"Duong Don","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/8J7ekjASe85or26TyFRyUS5Bwad.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56f971fb92514156d8000781","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Hiệp","original_name":"Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Hiệp","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/9e81jbhJ7cZkFaHPO71jb0t0Hka.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57ce8ac992514148ee000158","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1293685,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Việt Linh","original_name":"Việt Linh","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/3Bt8k9B3r8xz7wnm9Jr9qReYdMa.jpg","credit_id":"53aa6d270e0a2646c500156b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
