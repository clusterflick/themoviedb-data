His efforts go largely unappreciated by his elders, who tease him and nickname him \"The Flea\", and his concerned parents are convinced his preoccupation with his newspaper will distract him from more serious studies and forbid him to continue it.  Ilias' only allies are a quixotic eccentric and a sensitive schoolgirl. The villagers' scoffing at Ilias' ambitions changes to admiration when an Athenian journalist shows up to do a story on Ilias. He becomes disheartened, however when he realizes much of their enthusiasm stems from hopes for increased tourism spurred by his fame and he distrusts the journalist's motives as well.","popularity":0.2923,"poster_path":"/uYcGmh2uPp8R3XnEmUmtLhqCZ7u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/hDJO96mUfqtB9ia7ef7mEvguPxl.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flea","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pantelis Trivizas","original_name":"Pantelis Trivizas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53a8659b0e0a2614490061e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasilis Kolovos","original_name":"Βασίλης Κολοβός","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/72APWPMEY7sKL51jd5mWTOv0ouo.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5d25757569d28054b7009c41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1333731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitra Hatoupi","original_name":"Δήμητρα Χατούπη","popularity":0.2841,"profile_path":"/1msx1VBE9YCBZtkYnP0CJACOrXj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"53a865b30e0a26143f006515","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1333732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amalia Giza","original_name":"Αμαλία Γκιζά","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/3WniFdavHpdTXI548Dee99AvB60.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"53a865bf0e0a26143f00651b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1333733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kostoula Tsellou","original_name":"Κωστούλα Τσέλλου","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"53a865cc0e0a26143600622f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Spyrou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Σπύρου","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"53a865d90e0a2614420060e6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333726,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Prokopis Dafnos","original_name":"Prokopis Dafnos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a864f70e0a26143f006504","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333728,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michales Terzis","original_name":"Μιχάλης Τερζής","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a865810e0a26144500609c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Spyrou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Σπύρου","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a864af0e0a261445006090","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Spyrou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Σπύρου","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55fc00e89251413d4b0020f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Spyrou","original_name":"Δημήτρης Σπύρου","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55fc00e2c3a36826f500204c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0100429","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2008,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uYcGmh2uPp8R3XnEmUmtLhqCZ7u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1429}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":918,"name":"newspaper"},{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":204846,"name":"flea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
