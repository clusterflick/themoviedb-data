Filmmaker Jenifer McShane spent four years visiting Bedford Hills and following the women and their families. A mother herself, Jenifer was drawn to the universal themes of motherhood and the staggering power of the mother-child relationship. In all walks of life, mother and child care for each other. As we watch the mothers inside Bedford trying to become their better selves, we see parts of our own selves - and that gives us all hope.","popularity":0.0691,"poster_path":"/7xjdoFAFqPo4obwI0MmMbdQ8Goo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it possible to become a better mother while serving time in a maximum security prison?","title":"Mothers of Bedford","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":958380,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toby Shimin","original_name":"Toby Shimin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0a7856c3a368218a01201d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenifer McShane","original_name":"Jenifer McShane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0a784ac3a368218a01200f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1704170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Mothers-of-Bedford-131314930965","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7xjdoFAFqPo4obwI0MmMbdQ8Goo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER for \"Mothers of Bedford\" documentary","key":"WxrwviqwyRo","published_at":"2012-11-01T20:33:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53a66bdfc3a3687a2b002b82"}]}}}
