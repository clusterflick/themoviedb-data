He's accompanied by the owner's son Brian and they've lined up Jack Cuortemayn, reputedly the best guide available, to take them there. Cuortemayn refuses as he doesn't care for the impact the railroad will have on the local inhabitants. While Moore tries to make other arrangements, he meets Ruth Knight who has lived there for many years working with her father in a medical clinic. There will be adventures along the way but when Ruth is captured by slave traders, it's up to the others to rescue her.","popularity":1.8893,"poster_path":"/kl82yxZjQD5v7VXJ6cmX442X4YV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Terror Strikes In The Jungle!","title":"Drums of Africa","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Avalon","original_name":"Frankie Avalon","popularity":0.3632,"profile_path":"/oBn64Yi9BXf0xWsNyPI0m9bEQf9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brian Ferrers","credit_id":"55753c1d9251414031003669","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Bochner","original_name":"Lloyd Bochner","popularity":0.7947,"profile_path":"/khch0Jh2N4XcyrmvczD6Eo61vAm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"David Moore","credit_id":"55753c3e9251413efe003511","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariette Hartley","original_name":"Mariette Hartley","popularity":1.4288,"profile_path":"/8imUoP6Y74jyFg1AhCqHXSIdce1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Knight","credit_id":"55753c4ac3a368569a0010b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torin Thatcher","original_name":"Torin Thatcher","popularity":0.3897,"profile_path":"/d5PZBimAcJjP239mVx98a2Ifv1o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jack Cuortemayn","credit_id":"58efac7ac3a36840df000148","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hari Rhodes","original_name":"Hari Rhodes","popularity":0.3689,"profile_path":"/tYEmkxghF55Bv2GcyIVbyOyn36P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kasongo","credit_id":"58efac8d92514104b5000173","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Sawaya","original_name":"George Sawaya","popularity":0.301,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Arab","credit_id":"58efac9b925141049900017c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Pate","original_name":"Michael Pate","popularity":0.6497,"profile_path":"/i0XniNOD6S6GB3LD7vHbYx5Z8ha.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Antonio Viledo","credit_id":"58efacb492514104b500018d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":988795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Whelan","original_name":"Ron Whelan","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ship Captain","credit_id":"58efacc392514104730001a9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Mamakos","original_name":"Peter Mamakos","popularity":0.2058,"profile_path":"/pCrSs8qvLAvE3l5aLxeoIbnnZam.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chavera","credit_id":"58efacd2c3a36841070001a0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Smith","original_name":"Eddie Smith","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/zbtq6dKhKGs0Zynnsu5Di4zkxVi.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Villager","credit_id":"58efacf6c3a36840c00001b5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Brown","original_name":"Calvin Brown","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Chief (uncredited)","credit_id":"608fdc3d3dd126002ac87dc0","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38250,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James B.
