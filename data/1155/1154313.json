Spanning over two years, the filmmakers attempt to reveal the visible and invisible control behind. They trace a mysterious organization which is suspected to secretly control the weather which dampens the mood and suppresses the intention of the public to participate in social movements. On the surface, the question on inclement weather could be answered by climate changes around the world. The underlying sordid discussion, however, is really about intervention, pervasive suppression and control instead of any conspiracy theory.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2014-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Rain: Representation and Will","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chan Tze-Woon","original_name":"Chan Tze-Woon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b93ef727db61011c1515cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6810926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
