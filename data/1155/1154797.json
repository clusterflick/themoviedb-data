The case is very opaque - nothing is what it seems at first glance. Are the suicides really dead? Webbs initially suspects an Indian servant of a nobleman, but thanks to Stuart's investigation, he is proven innocent. The other exotic characters appearing in the story all seem quite opaque and devious, as if they were in league with evil per se. Finally, in a dark vault, there is a showdown: the seemingly petrified dead, lined up like in a wax museum, suddenly awaken to new life in front of their alleged murderer!","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83533,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stuart Webbs-Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1915-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stuart Webbs: Die Toten erwachen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Reicher","original_name":"Ernst Reicher","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/4NtgwhFRjw6uwNMjjyqUD2p5aCY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Detektiv Stuart Webbs","credit_id":"64bb04a3cd204600e8f06346","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefanie Hantzsch","original_name":"Stefanie Hantzsch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64bb04b6528b2e011c1c33f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1715445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Richard","original_name":"Fritz Richard","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64bb04bf95c0af00ac4f974e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Stock","original_name":"Hans Stock","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64bb04c8357c000224fd5e8f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Ullmann","original_name":"Arthur Ullmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64bb04d2357c00021e9258b6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1903169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adolf Gärtner","original_name":"Adolf Gärtner","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bb04e2a313b800ae4ad80d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574736,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Max Fassbender","original_name":"Max Fassbender","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bb04fc528b2e011c1c341d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Leni","original_name":"Paul Leni","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/cY765lJFrvADxgdlsq6vB0NUY7h.jpg","credit_id":"64bb050895c0af013c1d7ecb","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Reicher","original_name":"Ernst Reicher","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/4NtgwhFRjw6uwNMjjyqUD2p5aCY.jpg","credit_id":"64bb04f15a788400c5116266","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006111","wikidata_id":"Q15805834","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
