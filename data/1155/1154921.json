Set against the backdrop of racial segregation and the horrors of war, the film delves into the Marine's journey from the initial days of training to witnessing the devastating aftermath of the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From Korea to Vietnam, the Marine's resilience and dedication shine through as he recounts his harrowing encounters with death and his unwavering commitment to his fellow soldiers. Through his story, the film sheds light on the often-overlooked contributions of African Americans in the Marine Corps and serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by these unsung heroes. Ultimately, it becomes a powerful testament to the Marine's determination to share his experiences, educate others, and preserve the legacy of African Americans in the military.","popularity":0.287,"poster_path":"/vpotXKKXgJnG46uAILuZnHVJHot.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A 96-year-old Montford Point Marine overcomes segregation, three wars, and personal sacrifice, reflecting on his journey and on becoming a voice to celebrate overlooked African American contributions in the Marine Corps.","title":"You Don't Know Jack: A Montford Point Marine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4174360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenda McDowell","original_name":"Brenda McDowell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Brenda McDowell","credit_id":"64bb89ea85c0a201254ef6b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4174361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William McDowell","original_name":"William McDowell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"William 'Jack' McDowell","credit_id":"64bb89fb58efd300e2f12c9e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
