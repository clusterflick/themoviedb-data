But there is a third man in the photo, the white Australian who finished second to Smith and ahead of Carlos in the 200 meters. His name is Peter Norman, and he stands in quiet solidarity with them. Normanâ€™s story is retold in this film with passion and perspective.","popularity":0.5328,"poster_path":"/oEf4RBL0sXsGczfybnkwi1PHPvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52707,"logo_path":"/tdwDYDKNAqHz7NoP43xoR0UD3ri.png","name":"Our Time Projects","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3793664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Norman","original_name":"Peter Norman","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64b9511f06f98400ac51987d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":971292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Heineman","original_name":"Matthew Heineman","popularity":0.5379,"profile_path":"/8oCaZnxxJfJuYUSfnotfiyyu5Dm.jpg","credit_id":"658b5dffdd2589715b6c73d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":971292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Heineman","original_name":"Matthew Heineman","popularity":0.5379,"profile_path":"/8oCaZnxxJfJuYUSfnotfiyyu5Dm.jpg","credit_id":"64b94e4627db6100ac3c7fea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Longoria","original_name":"Eva Longoria","popularity":2.5541,"profile_path":"/1u26GLWK1DE7gBugyI9P3OMFq4A.jpg","credit_id":"64b94e5227db6100ac3c7ff2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2127520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Spector","original_name":"Ben Spector","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b94e626aa8e0012fd58776","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Battsek","original_name":"John Battsek","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/b1Y4pusdEfKqNkIDjDKtlADpdaY.jpg","credit_id":"64b94ed1ab684900ad8c8ab4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6085556","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVehYuk48Cq8uMTtZHF5Fk0mdiW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oEf4RBL0sXsGczfybnkwi1PHPvR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":2070,"name":"olympic games"},{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ESPN \"SportsCenter\"","release_date":"2016-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
