A land does not always require human explanations to give it a meaning. \"Silent Delta\" is a film based on the testimonies of nature. A beached ocean-liner on Pinnacle Island; a lone goat who has lived on Cotton Island for five years; and on Peng-Jia Island, an apparition of a Japanese soldier, left behind from the times of the Japanese invasion. We come to the islands and devour these scenes with our cameras... Wandering between these three islands, we become a part of this silent ghostly landscape.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2000-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Delta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shen Ko-Shang","original_name":"Shen Ko-Shang","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/oVcTnXnTMwxxScEBqwP4Tebbcwq.jpg","credit_id":"64b93fd83009aa00e264480a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0282974","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
