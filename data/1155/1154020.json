Maria is a young woman from that village, unsatisfied with her marriage with João, who has never given her a child: her biggest desire. By cause of the funeral, Carlos arrives, and his arrival and Maria's emancipated behavior generate distrust from the other villagers. Maria, a serious, beautiful and virtuous woman, loved by every man in the village and hated by all the women, awakes in João the weakness of jealousy, and in Carlos the weakness of an old love.","popularity":0.0801,"poster_path":"/dI60WOtGDvOsBWb5bbD1Q5KZNxa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erros Meus, Má Fortuna, Amor Ardente","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Mirpuri","original_name":"Sofia Mirpuri","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/hHbhuEg1kSAWuLyNMfaHX3qIEPu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"64b8242deee18600e37291ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2404812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Brás","original_name":"Beatriz Brás","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/3Wz42BroMiysP9Y8qHh6GgHDG2Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64b82480d399e6014e5e0e61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3366525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victhor Börrén Dias","original_name":"Victhor Börrén Dias","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fUI1qIRLnbDGVFRMDKW5AQqwp7G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64b8244b5aadc400c58ad44b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1201611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Côrte-Real","original_name":"Teresa Côrte-Real","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/of7PQ9qcXYLFNYBtOgD10itzkwP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mãe","credit_id":"64b82458eee18600aed93f6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Duarte","original_name":"Patricia Duarte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64b8246c5aadc40139d17b99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3085285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Bandeira","original_name":"João Bandeira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mnq5BO52G4t3NdgkcMB3q8Uc2D4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64b82496fdc146013aab3b5c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4039307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joana Brito Silva","original_name":"Joana Brito Silva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/71fx9HjGpML2Omy975CHuZ23YqR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64b824a6d399e6012db4f349","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3190081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Guedes","original_name":"José Guedes","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/9xUrjcgQNadGU1F5MagdRMudRTk.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Villager","credit_id":"680132cb2e8958f0f9994c47","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Durão","original_name":"Tiago Durão","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/2AX0zypVPTqijPoGXGrnPQ46aB5.jpg","credit_id":"64b824e755b0c000e2cb8b0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Durão","original_name":"Tiago Durão","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/2AX0zypVPTqijPoGXGrnPQ46aB5.jpg","credit_id":"64b824feeee18600aed93f9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12326604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/7vjv9BreklwbeHbq8AdPgLu6nma.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2160},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/bb9MZVnSq7jH6pBySJJzYXmWsa8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2816,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/dI60WOtGDvOsBWb5bbD1Q5KZNxa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1986},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/nLgZ8ryk0C7OcI9Y7fHT4G2Xd8P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
