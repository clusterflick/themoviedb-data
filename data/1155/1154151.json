Despite being a major high school recruit, Plunkettâ€™s freshman year at Stanford was a letdown, and his coach tried to replace him at quarterback. He refused to be taken out and eventually became a standout at Stanford, winning the Rose Bowl and Heisman his senior year. The start to his pro career was not very different from his turn in college, starting off slow, being traded to several teams, and eventually landing a backup position with the Raiders. It was only when the starting quarterback got injured that Plunkett was thrust into the role, and ended up leading the Raiders to two Super Bowl victories.","popularity":0.3233,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17731,"logo_path":"/5g3YMbcDXJKQvnYU1irjw5T8y7Z.png","name":"Freestyle Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guys Like Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Chavira","original_name":"Ricardo Chavira","popularity":0.4985,"profile_path":"/lgFzss4nrwhf4dpOM71wQZoxA4X.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64b8ada727db6100ff8f8ae7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howie Long","original_name":"Howie Long","popularity":0.257,"profile_path":"/qEnlcLGMS3mVp3XJRm4TmmCXb0U.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b8ae6b6aa8e000ed9b3a4f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Longoria","original_name":"Eva Longoria","popularity":2.5541,"profile_path":"/1u26GLWK1DE7gBugyI9P3OMFq4A.jpg","credit_id":"64b8a0c727db6100e2916a8e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556874,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Chinoy","original_name":"Kevin Chinoy","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8adf227db6100ac3c381b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171270,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Bradley","original_name":"John Bradley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8ae12ab684900ad8c4174","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171267,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeffrey Schneider","original_name":"Jeffrey Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8ae2b4d23dd00c813b79f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Chavira","original_name":"Ricardo Chavira","popularity":0.4985,"profile_path":"/lgFzss4nrwhf4dpOM71wQZoxA4X.jpg","credit_id":"64b8a0b811386c012df232d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2127520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Spector","original_name":"Ben Spector","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8aca71685da011b6db7a6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":955154,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesca Silvestri","original_name":"Francesca Silvestri","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8ade625882300ae635424","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5039708","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fJDxWDsdrelxpPqFqXAzRCwUuWi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ESPN \"SportsCenter\"","release_date":"2015-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
