But she finds the discipline and sacrifice required to be a professional, extremely challenging. Growing up in New Jersey with hippy parents, her teenage years were spent caring for her younger siblings and schooling herself in the local library. At 19, Wrenna makes her pilgrimage to Hawaii's North Shore risking it all on big waves.  She is confronted by the pressures of carving out a professional sporting life as a woman and without a sponsor she works two jobs to support her dream. Filming over ten years, from Oahu’s iconic big wave, Waimea Bay to the cold waters of Mavericks to the ultimate big wave of Peahi (Jaws), we travel with Wrenna through the seasons, the highs and the lows of facing your fears - to find out how much bigger you can be.","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":"/22tBOMaSP8eupmWIqSsj0BlWb9W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bigger Than Me is a female coming-of-age film about the complexity of being a girl and the challenges that drive you as a woman to take on the elemental power of big waves.","title":"Bigger Than Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4172377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wrenna Delgado","original_name":"Wrenna Delgado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b99d833009aa00e2646e29","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4172378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Gorman","original_name":"Claire Gorman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b99d973009aa00e2646e47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tgyq7h6u2tdTTz5soxDGpmsM5MW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1599}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22tBOMaSP8eupmWIqSsj0BlWb9W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5349,"name":"surfing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
