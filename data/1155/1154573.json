Onoe Shoroku II and Onoe Baiko VII discuss and demonstrate their craft in conversation with the well-known author of works on Asian arts, Faubion Bowers. Includes film of great kabuki performances of the past. These great kabuki actors make the mechanics of theater kata (poses) clear and show some of the gestures and nuances of body language that communicate specific emotions and situations. Baiko, a famous player of women’s roles, performs a classic woman’s speech in full costume and heavy white-face make-up, and then does the same scene again in plain face and simple clothes. He shows how the Japanese fan speaks in its own language. He and Shoroku act out a fight scene; Shoroku demonstrates one of kabuki’s elaborate exit walk sequences, and compares different ways of making stylized gestures.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kabuki Techniques","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shōroku Onoe II","original_name":"二代目 尾上松緑","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/6ifWUIWPP6pN0JwLJ6GRXAiYMvO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65d2d507387651016331519c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2964782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Onoe Baiko VII","original_name":"Onoe Baiko VII","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/oufUPmevDFpaWVjj07bm8rMINNZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65d2d5142da8460185254542","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2643658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faubion Bowers","original_name":"Faubion Bowers","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/laUYG3wlfnnvNmVLgaSQp9XmVJi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65d2d5244d67910186d3905c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2256608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James MacAndrew","original_name":"James MacAndrew","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/v7C99jDjLxdneZpuNr5MaD2HcG0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65d2d5eb1684f70164d07ef0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258656,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephan Chodorov","original_name":"Stephan Chodorov","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d2d5947614210163ff2280","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merrill Brockway","original_name":"Merrill Brockway","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d2d5624d67910186d390d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1230143","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kabuki Techniques (Faubion Bowers et al.)","key":"tKb8XgI7hJs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-12-08T23:25:06.000Z","id":"65d2d659761421017cff7aa0"}]}}}
