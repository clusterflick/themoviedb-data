He walks in the park with her, has lunch and falls asleep. But she is already in her thirties, and the search for the hero of her novel has entered a critical phase. She even filled out a questionnaire on a dating site, went on a date, was with a sorcerer. So, probably, everything would have continued: friends are great, there is a dog, but love somehow does not come - if Vera had not met Andrey one day. By the way, he also had a dog.","popularity":0.1723,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog Walking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":386918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avdotya Smirnova","original_name":"Авдотья Смирнова","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/vzLyiN36G4SNxeKBjiuBxeCxBbV.jpg","credit_id":"64b91de26aa8e001504bf765","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":386918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avdotya Smirnova","original_name":"Авдотья Смирнова","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/vzLyiN36G4SNxeKBjiuBxeCxBbV.jpg","credit_id":"64b92057ab684900c5dc441b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
