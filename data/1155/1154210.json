They left the country with an understanding that they were going to perform in Southeast Asia. However, they arrived and put on a spot to perform, sometimes risking their lives, for the soldiers on the battlefield of Vietnam. Kitty was recognized for her musical talent, and formed the five-member girl band ‘Korean Black Eyes’ in Bangkok in 1971. The band moved onto Beirut as their base and toured throughout the Middle East and Africa, including Egypt and Nigeria. When they entered Spain in 1973, they went on a concert tour with Cliff Richard, Julio Iglesias, and others. They recorded an album in Portugal at the suggestion of a local producer, but had to quickly escape the country when the military revolution broke out. Wherever they went, including Vietnam and Lebanon, they encountered turbulent scenes of modern history.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s765cv8oW9iVIS8oO1Ldtsr53qu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118128,"logo_path":null,"name":"INDELINE","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Korean Black Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2307836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Dae-hyun","original_name":"Kim Dae-hyun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8ed6d4d23dd01448c720c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.725,"height":2483,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s765cv8oW9iVIS8oO1Ldtsr53qu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"Jecheon International Music & Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
