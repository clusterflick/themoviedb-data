High school cover band Anthem, composed of musicians from Chaminade and DeSmet high schools, played many gigs for several years at clubs, parties, and school dances in the late 70’s around the St. Louis area. By their own admission they weren’t the best of bands, but the relationships made along the way have created a vast network of community of friends and family across the country. The band (Jim Carlton, Tim Robert, Rich Tlapek, and Bud Corrubia) decides to reunite after more than four decades to create an album and put on a live show.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The incredible story of a rock ‘n roll dream that just wouldn’t die","title":"Anthem: The Road To Redemption","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Anthem: The Road To Redemption (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","key":"806454510","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-09T18:17:01.000Z","id":"64b9e48c06f984011b0d392b"}]}}}
