A fiercely independent woman who turned her back on societal conventions at a time when few were as brave, she observed and recorded the world with wonder and curiosity, and an astute political sensibility.  This special edition award winning documentary explores the woman behind the words in a fascinating film which shows her personal life to be as fascinating as her extensive journeys. The minutiae of life at home in Lismore and journeys abroad with her grandchildren provide an intimate backdrop to interviews with Dervla, her daughter Rachel, her publisher John Murray and fellow travel writers Michael Palin and Manchán Magan.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9HIEdZpewpV9PZnELX5Myt730H3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mixed Bag Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who Is Dervla Murphy?","title":"Who is Dervla Murphy?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dervla Murphy","original_name":"Dervla Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64b9244911386c00eb6d7861","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garret Daly","original_name":"Garret Daly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b924a23009aa00ffbf03f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1919196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9HIEdZpewpV9PZnELX5Myt730H3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Extended Edition","release_date":"2016-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Extended Edition","release_date":"2016-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
