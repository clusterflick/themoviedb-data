Against a backdrop of distant news events, kids stampede for Easter eggs; horses run together; families read pulps and shoot craps; cooks fry; tin-can tourists work hard at leisure; people pose, clown and drink, pull back the husks of sweet corn. For them and for us, remaking the ephemeral gesture is both a small pleasure and an act of survival. The home movie segments used in the film date from 1930 to 1969, the period in which the near-infinite and mostly-unseen archive of home movies that awaits our attention was born.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/aWYoo0RHd6ZSByCHq6q0kkpn8oz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All-Is-Well","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Prelinger","original_name":"Rick Prelinger","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b851cf3009aa00e263bda0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6100978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aWYoo0RHd6ZSByCHq6q0kkpn8oz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"All-Is-Well","key":"184381374","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-09-26T17:24:38.000Z","id":"64b8518d27db61011c149985"}]}}}
