Hassan, a 55-year-old heading for England in pursuit of a new life. The incident gathered him with the second character, (Rakan) 30 years old, a young Syrian activist in the Syrian revolution . During the night they spend in a Warehouse in the port of Calais - France. The relationship between the two shows Rhakan's reservation towards Hassan, who seems absurd and speaks a lot while Rakan briefly answers Hassan's questions. Hassan appears to be sick and have a fever. In a dramatic moment and as the fever mounts over Hassan, Rakan announces that he knows Hassan and his true identity. A confrontation between the two leads to the absurdity. We see another face for these characters that makes violence a hallmark of the night. The next morning the sunbeam carries the truth that reveals the hidden story and puts everyone in front of his destiny to face what he has done.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/uxuiGHUNMvG0fx2QsrbsnEaYOkL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hangar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4118447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Alarashi","original_name":"Mohamed Alarashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64b9a0943009aa00ffbf3207","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959550,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanna M.
