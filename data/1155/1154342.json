For the past years, the former Portuguese colony has been Asia's main gambling city with a prosperous economy and also a home for many foreigners of different nationalities. There are countless emotions and conflicts in an emigration process; curiosity, novelty, facing other cultural realities, uncertainty; they can even be contradictory feelings. Then there is balance, and the ability to more or less blend ourselves in the other's culture, and take or not habits as if they were ours, in a transformation process, where we also share our customs with the other, in a search for home. SOM TAM is about the Thai community in Macau. Following JJ, Sakol, Kay and her family, Ian Ian and Chatsada we come across a supermarket, a Thai restaurant and a Thai Festival all drawn together in Macau as a background.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Som Tam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529818,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vanessa Pimentel","original_name":"Vanessa Pimentel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b95e53ab6849013914bafe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26755093","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
