From a chance visit to the Pentagon, to growing up in a vibrant integrated neighborhood, his story is one of resilience and inspiration. Fueled by the determination to seize educational opportunities, he enlists just in time to experience the racial divisions of his era before Truman desegregates the military. Thrust into the brutality of the Korean War, the weight of combat becomes an indelible part of his soul. Returning home, he embarks on a new path as an architect and discovers unexpected connections in far-off Pakistan. As his family expands, his sons reflect on the man who raised them and the legacy he instilled. This film unearths the essence of the Black experience in the early 20th century, paints a vivid portrait of the Chosin Reservoir, and unravels the intricate tapestry of race, family, and personal growth.","popularity":1.2723,"poster_path":"/mgw7LtCMDvZe1igd2zBVCEtF0W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An African American architect’s captivating journey through the challenges of early 20th century America, the brutal Korean War, and the complexities of race and family, as he discovers strength, inspiration, and unexpected connections along the way.","title":"The Architect: A Montford Point Marine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4174379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wilcots","original_name":"David Wilcots","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"David Wilcots","credit_id":"64bb8fb2ac6c7908df4bf7ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4174380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Wilcots","original_name":"Eric Wilcots","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Eric Wilcots","credit_id":"64bb8fbceb79c200e28cd670","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4174381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Wilcots","original_name":"Henry Wilcots","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Henry Wilcots","credit_id":"64bb8fc7eb79c200ff9c76c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4174382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhenglong Zhong","original_name":"Zhenglong Zhong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Voice Actor","credit_id":"64bb8fd5eb79c200e28cd67f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665337,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joshua Cardenas","original_name":"Joshua Cardenas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bb8f8258efd300ff1ad412","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
