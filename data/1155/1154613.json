This is Scotland! Embarking from the colorful Borders and Hadrian's Wall we travel to the abbeys, and to Gretna Green. To Ayr, Dumfries and Culzean Castle, with its memories of General Eisenhower. And on to the Cinderella city of Glasgow and Loch Lomond. To Oban, Ben Nevis, Glenfinnan and haunting Glencoe. Excursion to fabled island--Skye, holy Iona and \"Fingal's Cave\"--and on to the Orkneys and the Shetlands, renowned for their loveable ponies.","popularity":0.5521,"poster_path":"/9NxxwlplmFbLoHbHxVGSg5mZXVb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145582,"logo_path":"/ctbq8gId8vGR84leHsY2iKQFQU0.png","name":"Questar Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touring Scotland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ward Ohrman","original_name":"Ward Ohrman","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64ba85b6ab684900ff4a6c26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelly Carlson","original_name":"Shelly Carlson","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64ba85c13009aa00ad62ae30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64ba8740ab6849013915547c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Forsberg","original_name":"Rolf Forsberg","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ba8635ab684900c5dcef84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173061,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mary Liz Adair","original_name":"Mary Liz Adair","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ba86613009aa00e2650162","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4173059,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Albert J.
