At the request of Asagiri (TJ Kayama), he helps the former Hanazono Union leader, now on the run from the Aoi-kai. Shinichi’s former mentor, Takeharu Mori (Tetsu Watanabe), president of Mori Industries, is being driven to the brink of bankruptcy due to an eviction dispute with the Aoi-kai.  Seeking a trigger to start the fight, Shinichi asks Mori for his cooperation. At last, the ten brave men are assembled. With his father's banner—the Koda-gumi—raised high, Shinichi leads them into a fierce war against the mighty Aoi-kai.  \"Now, brave men... it's time to
