The film tells about two well-men, Misula (Boro Stjepanovic) and Puja (Ljubomir Bandovic), contradictory attitudes and opinions which, in everyday disputes, revealed apparent mutual hostility and indifference, but also a joy to be doomed to a life together. Misula in this respect the embodiment of the old sages, and the apprentice's Pujo naive hasty hedonist. While glossed over planes and bomb Serbia, these two ordinary man, coincidentally ignorant of the events, marathon busy digging wells to a sardonic but humorous way, dissolve pitful weight and personal lives. Besides well-men unaware of the historical moment and one Valjevo village lives almost bizarre, peacetime everyday, until the sound of explosions killer time approaching.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wevZirVKzTYO7KOhNScInptqwvV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cekrk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2395169","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":875,"iso_639_1":"sh","file_path":"/wevZirVKzTYO7KOhNScInptqwvV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":626}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
