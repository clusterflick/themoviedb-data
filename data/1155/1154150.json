Séfar is the largest troglodyte city in the world, with several thousand fossilized houses. Very few travelers go there given its geographical remoteness and especially because of the difficulties of access to the site. The site is full of several paintings, some of which date back more than 12,000 years, mostly depicting animals and scenes of hunting or daily life which testify that this hostile place has not always been an inhabited desert. Local superstition suggests that the site is inhabited by djins, no doubt in connection with the strange paintings found on the site.","popularity":0.4507,"poster_path":"/7MIWqtv5TMVwXPfCQ3AQuWqG6ZP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204470,"logo_path":"/tydvOpdqAov5jAbLKH6WTziSPvn.png","name":"Canal Algérie","origin_country":"DZ"},{"id":75116,"logo_path":"/sXVtODFB1De5N9AnuNTKD47MiOb.png","name":"Établissement National de Télévision (ENTV)","origin_country":"DZ"},{"id":204473,"logo_path":"/p0eaGkk8hZXRBlit0WJyG5mvYG2.png","name":"Star Events Audiovisuel","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Séfar, A City of Mysteries","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"سيفا, مدينة الغموض","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Séfar, A City of Mysteries","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hammou Agabou","original_name":"Hammou Agabou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self (Guide)","credit_id":"64b8a58b3009aa0139677afc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baba Atanouf","original_name":"Baba Atanouf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self (Guide)","credit_id":"64b8a5beab684900ff497e10","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamel Souig","original_name":"Kamel Souig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8a31f25882300ae634d80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamel Souig","original_name":"Kamel Souig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8a49e25882300ae634e73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khaled Benyoucef","original_name":"Khaled Benyoucef","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8a4a63009aa00ad61c4ac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khaled Benyoucef","original_name":"Khaled Benyoucef","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8a55b27db6100ff8f84ee","department":"Camera","job":"Drone Cinematographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4171244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khaled Benyoucef","original_name":"Khaled Benyoucef","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8a30f1685da00feae6de8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171246,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mohamed Baouch","original_name":"Mohamed Baouch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b8a5085a07f500e4b5cc46","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wa2qZNn6hVOZ9QWDxCyS0ulmOmY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXjtybKDq7JTnvkGHryO7ogcYKR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mdVKLJjVX3e4JzXZ0ar0adeOt7T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Sg1wW3xjZv0UI5PSSsVBdHqTBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVU3TI6YiCvzDoe2RqGWDlVz4Qn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ek8YazZHDmwfpVyXL1DeeRb9pCt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7MIWqtv5TMVwXPfCQ3AQuWqG6ZP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":184134,"name":"archeology"},{"id":189126,"name":"north africa"},{"id":191414,"name":"troglodyte"},{"id":286702,"name":"human history"},{"id":299610,"name":"tamanrasset"},{"id":312749,"name":"sahara"},{"id":320760,"name":"algerian sahara"},{"id":320761,"name":"algerian desert"},{"id":320762,"name":"séfar"},{"id":320763,"name":"tassili n'ajjer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
