Each and every one of the group's participants is related in one way or another to post-trauma.  It has a mother of a post-traumatic, a wife of, a child of, a woman who served as an observer, and four men of various ages, some of whom are not diagnosed or recognized as post-traumatic.  From Liebek's iconic photos and from photos that the participants bring themselves, an intuitive and authentic discourse develops about post-trauma as a social phenomenon that has penetrated every home in Israel, about audio-visual images as shapers of consciousness and also about the way to grow from trauma through sharing, recognition, creation, humanity and compassion.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/iQ4mc5T3N0vbNzgrGLmA1EffaPa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129053,"logo_path":"/7Qtj1FmPeXbc4ZHTkl7eB0itG3p.png","name":"Yes
