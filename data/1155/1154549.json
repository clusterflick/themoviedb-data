But her freedom is at risk, constant tremors make her fear that her children want to send her to a hospice. The situation worsened after she slipped when coming out of the shower, breaking her arm. After a few days of convalescence and blackmails by her neighbor Grazia, she imagines a perfect lunch with her children and their partners, which becomes a nightmare when a tremor in her arm makes her drop the bowl she was holding. The only thing left to do is overcoming the old misunderstandings, but the will does not persist on both her and her son’s side.","popularity":0.1031,"poster_path":"/sUpBHrjwTpeKdgC708XzwkNwy8f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fallen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Fallen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosanna Griffini","original_name":"Rosanna Griffini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mariuccia","credit_id":"64ba55de4d23dd00e7ce03cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Quarti","original_name":"Cristina Quarti","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/xQnAKHy1r9dUGrgkqqZXC48GQyu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grazia","credit_id":"64ba560111386c014d29db8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4172934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selene Demà","original_name":"Selene Demà","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Marta","credit_id":"64ba56176aa8e0010ec8d14c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacomo Valdameri","original_name":"Giacomo Valdameri","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/55RgKSDzYOy2srZbrA3WGAbqvtU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marco","credit_id":"64ba562f3009aa0139685d0b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4193273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Barera","original_name":"Luca Barera","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ca11b2001bbd0126a78e23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4193273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Barera","original_name":"Luca Barera","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ca32eb0b74e900ac66b2d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21869026","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":866,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/sUpBHrjwTpeKdgC708XzwkNwy8f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":606}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
