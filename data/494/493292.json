Dick decides to impersonate her butler and uses that position to keep all of Mary's suitors out of the house so he can work on her himself. When his ruse is discovered, he is thrown out of the house. That, however, doesn't stop him. He gets the maid to help him concoct a story about Mary actually being bald and having false teeth, hoping to drive them away. It works, but it doesn't quite have the effect he intended it to.","popularity":0.1647,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christie Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call the Wagon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neal Burns","original_name":"Neal Burns","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/cs4oHDGo8TT3rHsMWMscJaMCUWF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Dick","credit_id":"5a3745c3c3a36814ae05c465","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babe London","original_name":"Babe London","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/8Pndi7GxFjJqsmfcwdsm4DBi7Bm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Maid","credit_id":"61351dccb84f94002a4a4c22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Merriam","original_name":"Charlotte Merriam","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/51gcGksRrnNUYdnnMBNnYcUGfWU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"63b1bdd357530e008dcb58ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George B.
