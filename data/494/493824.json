However, she recently got an offer from the French consul to a mission in Pondicherry, India to teach her skills to Indians. She can only do this if she gets her high-school diploma, something she neglected to do earlier. The idea of this new post motivates her to rectify her youthful omission, and she goes back to school in Montparnasse. Just before classes are to start, her current boyfriend's condescending ways prove too much for her, and she breaks up with him, reacting to that by getting drunk. Thus, when she has to take the subway to school on the first day, being unfamiliar with the route and somewhat the worse for wear, she gets lost. Fortunately, she meets an elderly man, a retired musician for the Paris Opera, who is headed for the very same destination. The two form a relationship of mutual encouragement and support.","popularity":0.4429,"poster_path":"/zOwZqPZGr5TuvFLy0CjZconNXUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montparnasse-Pondichéry","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miou-Miou","original_name":"Miou-Miou","popularity":0.3525,"profile_path":"/kjQD9nNjcakYxOmXq1IG66y1RtU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"5d50b9cd0102c90014754a65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André
