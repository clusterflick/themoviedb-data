The enchanting plot harks back to medieval history: Wolfram is a lovesick troubadour who desires the virtuous Elisabeth. She, however, has eyes for another: the rebellious knight Tannhäuser, who in turn cannot get over an overwhelming sensual experience in the realm of the goddess Venus, and is banished for singing her praises at court. Only saintly Elisabeth’s death can atone for his misdeeds.","popularity":0.4777,"poster_path":"/jIajvHQFaiLhfiTVslKrtvlenw7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":189,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera - Wagner: Tannhäuser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cassilly","original_name":"Richard Cassilly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tannhäuser","credit_id":"5a3a40980e0a264cca20873f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Marton","original_name":"Éva Marton","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/5KvVYcoNhvzI9qD1T7U7WmaClsD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elisabeth","credit_id":"5a3a40a80e0a264cbe207ac2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1003167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Troyanos","original_name":"Tatiana Troyanos","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/nSazaO6IKNfyjfTM34VHU2qmIha.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Venus","credit_id":"5a3a40b5c3a3680b9d1f415b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Macurdy","original_name":"John Macurdy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Hermann, Landgrave of Thuringia","credit_id":"5a3a40bfc3a368148f07f9e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Weikl","original_name":"Bernd Weikl","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/r8NkIhBstdKCq1FPqE1yn8sRVCu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Wolfram von Eschenbach","credit_id":"5a3a40d10e0a264cd020fdb7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Nagy","original_name":"Robert Nagy","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Walther von der Vogelweide","credit_id":"5a3a40df0e0a264cc42026fa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard J.
