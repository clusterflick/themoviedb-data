The guests of Tallinn's legendary cafes \"Pearl\" and \"Moscow\" were filmed in their own time. The uniqueness of the film is expressed through a strangely independent soundtrack that observes everyday bustle from the heights of melancholy poetry and remote uranography. Artur Alliksaar's poetry is read by Aarne Üksküla.","popularity":0.5778,"poster_path":"/adTMsOLUyw9XpSZ5je3X1PWKvjl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1969-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"511 Best Photographs of Mars","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5a375431925141032c1e732f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437460,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Enn Vetemaa","original_name":"Enn Vetemaa","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/h1aZBdQ5QDLwx5hlMzEMhS2VlXL.jpg","credit_id":"5fec9eab5ad76b003dcd05ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2916845,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Artur Alliksaar","original_name":"Artur Alliksaar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fec9ec0d40d4c004087478c","department":"Crew","job":"Poem"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5fec9ed7b42242003f41bb99","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2520432","wikidata_id":"Q19999771","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/adTMsOLUyw9XpSZ5je3X1PWKvjl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"In cinemas nationwide","release_date":"1969-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
