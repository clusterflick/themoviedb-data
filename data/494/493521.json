This poetic documentary introduces us to her creations - houses built from clay, bamboo, slate and river stone, constructed in tribute to their natural surroundings. At the age of 86, Didi Contractor pursues her vision working day and night - dreaming her designs then designing her dreams. She sketches roughly, then proportions with pinpoint accuracy, the blueprints for economically and ecologically sustainability.","popularity":0.0928,"poster_path":"/9Xf105qOmmPNrynBtzYu37CG1Pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Individuofilm","origin_country":""},{"id":98663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xaras media GbR","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Didi Contractor: Marrying the Earth to the Building","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didi Contractor","original_name":"Didi Contractor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a3861cac3a36814a806f71c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944141,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maria Rank","original_name":"Maria Rank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a386341c3a3680b9d1dbc12","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steffi Giaracuni","original_name":"Steffi Giaracuni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a386368c3a3680b881f5111","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steffi Giaracuni","original_name":"Steffi Giaracuni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3861ea0e0a264cca1eef14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7162450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Xf105qOmmPNrynBtzYu37CG1Pg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2301,"name":"architect"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LICHTER Filmfest Frankfurt International","release_date":"2017-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
