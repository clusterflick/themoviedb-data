Two are widows whose family members (one husband, one son) were Afghan vets who committed suicide. The other two are women who lost family members because Detroit Edison turned off their electricity during the winter. Wilkerson does nothing to draw parallels between these two forms of injustice. Rather, by simply juxtaposing the women’s stories, we are able to see how systematic indifference to human life takes multiple forms, but comes back to the same root causes, and how we are indeed fighting the same war against the poor and disenfranchised at home and abroad – ici et ailleurs. – Michael Sicinski, Mubi Notebook.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/4XDzVJsCRbMPRDeoIlBp6wInIcR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments of Dissolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Travis Wilkerson","original_name":"Travis Wilkerson","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/B8v4cdOMPlSwblb9IFBR9BsMg5.jpg","credit_id":"5a3af984c3a368148f08bcf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XDzVJsCRbMPRDeoIlBp6wInIcR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
