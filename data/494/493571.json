Written in 1668, the play has been somewhat dwarfed by such like-vintage Moliere classics as The Imaginary Invalid. Still, it was popular enough in its time to inspire imitation, most notably Betterton's Don Juan and The Amorous Widow. The plot, involving a wealthy man's avoidance of marriage until he is trapped by a crafty widow, is but a peg upon which to hang any number of comic complications and character vignettes. Brasseur's leading lady is the toothsome Zabou.","popularity":0.3025,"poster_path":"/zwUbeHAWzk3CPVvIRxknvf8ioMS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films
