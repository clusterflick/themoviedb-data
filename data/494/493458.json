Louis Perry is discharged from the penitentiary, having served his sentence. He immediately resumes relations with his evil companions. One day he happens to meet Lillian Garvey, a Salvation Army worker. One of his companions insults her and Louis resents it and incurs his enmity. Lillian is the only good woman he has known for years and he learns to love her. Her influence tempts him to abandon the life he is leading, and he attends the services and becomes converted. Just at this juncture Madeline Raymond, a woman of the underworld, who was his sweetheart before he was arrested, again comes into his life.","popularity":0.3437,"poster_path":"/fHLxOb8kMjClW4MVImGsIBuPkbQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Moving Pictures Co. of America (IMP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Better Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":921738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Baggot","original_name":"King Baggot","popularity":0.4096,"profile_path":"/3RH89Z7zLKJjVRyb0vz27fWn9d3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Louis Perry - a Reformed Crook","credit_id":"5a37edaac3a368148f05fb90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lillian Garvey - a Salvation Army Lass","credit_id":"5a37edc692514103361f02f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a37edd2c3a36814ae06639f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931237,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas H.
