Embedded in the movement, native activist and filmmaker Cody Lucich chronicles the sweeping struggle in stunning clarity, as the forces battle through summer to bitter winter, capturing the spirit and havoc of an uprising.  From the initial gathering days on the Standing Rock reservation, the movement grew to thousands of water protectors, living in a protest camp and resisting construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Akicita focuses on the voices of young Native warriors who stepped up to lead the charge, expressing the beats of the movement from every frontâ€”confrontations with the police, the vibrant daily customs of the camp, and more. Through the eyes of the young Native protesters, the struggle feels deeply personal.","popularity":0.3551,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":98755,"logo_path":null,"name":"Firestarter Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akicita: The Battle of Standing Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Lucich","original_name":"Cody Lucich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b9ad4c3a3680b9d208ae5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7768834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"AkicitaFilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"AkicitaFilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sID3rXTgNw7Ykn9zAe7ow6Nn6o0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXQigRrzJbd35UTQAmmoK3hhzTv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sN9nohL4qgBM3ILLtWbLsKla2rB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mFq045Bqw3ktxMDSuVmqwGS1Wgw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ssvb2EVQ4Jz69yMUolJkytGi8Qf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance","release_date":"2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
