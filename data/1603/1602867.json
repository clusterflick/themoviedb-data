The 2006 video Pisagua was shot by director Veronica Quense, when the latter went with Lemebel to visit the city and collect the testimonies of the residents. The result of their experience is this action in which the artist walks barefoot, holding his heels in his hand, towards the sea. With every step he takes on the white cloth Lemebel leaves behind faint blood-colored footprints: a tribute to all the homosexuals and dissident feminists who lost their lives in that place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yqoPhxF6yD2XYgEWVYPMDC1vliB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pisagua","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344128,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pedro Lemebel","original_name":"Pedro Lemebel","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/rI8aJhfkkHZA3S3NIlGmVG7Bplb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"694a68731b3349feaf8cebbd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verónica Quense","original_name":"Verónica Quense","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a68608eee8717838cedf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344128,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pedro Lemebel","original_name":"Pedro Lemebel","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/rI8aJhfkkHZA3S3NIlGmVG7Bplb.jpg","credit_id":"694a6869f9efd0381e073b05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yqoPhxF6yD2XYgEWVYPMDC1vliB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
