Her partner, Charlie, wants to have honest, difficult conversations about their feelings. When the two stumble upon an ice rink in the park, we see Anna at her best: spontaneous, fun, pushing Charlie out of her comfort zone. Later that night, Charlie receives devastating news from her mom over the phone. Instead of asking Charlie about it, Anna avoids Charlie and acts as if everything’s fine. As their relationship falls apart, Anna must overcome her fear of opening up if she wants to keep Charlie in her life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/A3JJAlYwFjhNV9vrcYXjTM2QBQm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reflections of Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sanna Lexhed","original_name":"Sanna Lexhed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b5ef42b9c6f79fb11ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A3JJAlYwFjhNV9vrcYXjTM2QBQm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
