We constantly have to face pressure In our everyday lives: to perform at school or work, to conform, to fit in, and the pressure that we create for ourselves. 'Detested Unrested Attested Arrested' confronts these points of pressure and looks at how they influence an individual. In a semi-biographical rap performance, different facets of pressure are being explored; like the pressure that comes with the success of your peers, exploring or coming to terms with your own sexuality and the constantly intensifying pressure of unfinished work and overdue deadlines. 'Detested Unrested Attested Arrested' is both minimal in presentation as well as extravagant in its usage of effects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aKmRD96QydqwuAVVA3QorjkVKr3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tungsten Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":53280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gerrit Rietveld Academie","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detested Unrested Attested Arrested","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self / Performer","credit_id":"69487a9a03572e631d8126ae","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487ab45d4fa96ce2155432","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5793559,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Mokkala","original_name":"Leo Mokkala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487ade3a9b0e83740732ae","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891335,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yana Khazanovich","original_name":"Yana Khazanovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487aeed303a6bc278eb749","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891338,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yi Wang","original_name":"Yi Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b11128330a241b1c9b6","department":"Crew","job":"Set Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891341,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jorn Vlaanderen","original_name":"Jorn Vlaanderen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b204671fb7c99b1ca09","department":"Crew","job":"Set Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891343,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sabine Heydt","original_name":"Sabine Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b2fa3218202cc812414","department":"Crew","job":"Set Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891347,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Youngjin Park","original_name":"Youngjin Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b4902ba77b2d78ce63f","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891338,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yi Wang","original_name":"Yi Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b6ff6ad527ab3155389","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763868,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ward Trommelen","original_name":"Ward Trommelen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b812cd08a25390732a1","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirill Zakomoldin","original_name":"Kirill Zakomoldin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69487b8e6d621584d07ac024","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1339,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mHkuDqpK1o531IH8gvqL5u3log0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2381}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aKmRD96QydqwuAVVA3QorjkVKr3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":197049,"name":"exposition"},{"id":212755,"name":"personal diary"},{"id":242921,"name":"rap"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Installation at Gerrit Rietveld Graduation Show 2022, July 6-10 2022","release_date":"2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
