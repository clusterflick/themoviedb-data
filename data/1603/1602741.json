When the toy breaks, the boy puts it into a paper boat and floats it down the river. The boat docks, and as the soldier leaves the boat to meet a company of compatriots the fantasy begins: a battle with rough, tough, icky garden snails. The soldiers are beautiful: a bugler, a messenger, a gunner cleaning his weapon, a cook with his hand in a pot. The snails mount an offensive on the fort. It's a scene you may have missed in Patton, but can see tonight on PBS.\" - David Kleinberg, San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Spinello","original_name":"Barry Spinello","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a12e14e760029912fc830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
