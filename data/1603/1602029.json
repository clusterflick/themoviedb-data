Heydt’s great-grandfather was a member of the NSDAP and mayor of the small town of Haselünne in Emsland for almost 10 years during the Third Reich. Based on interviews with his grandfather and research in various archives, Heydt develops a personal perspective on the subject. The film deals with how we construct identity from oral retellings, how we process family histories, and how we can find current and personal points of access to German remembrance culture. At the heart of the work are two conversations with his grandfather Heinrich Heydt, recorded at different points in the research process. In them, the grandfather describes his memories of his father, the time, and the two reflect on the subject and the results of the research.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3BbEiGkaMOyF0TSQgNRehwY2Lnr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunstverein Grafschaft Bentheim","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weight Of My Name","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self / Narrator / Interviewer","credit_id":"694883b1860ee39e16812551","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69488445f0f0e19b772fbf75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948844f7894fbe8ef8125b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4138585,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Verburg","original_name":"Jan Verburg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69488489ea4043936f2fbf52","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694884dd60f3dcc4528ce353","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960505,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Ax","original_name":"Daniel Ax","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694884fd46f03006098eba38","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69488567a1b37fcb9ab1cad7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948857a7561f486e281236c","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1339,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m9TlEaBwsyMVKAQFc1yJ8JuEgVb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2381}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3BbEiGkaMOyF0TSQgNRehwY2Lnr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3664,"name":"research"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":279911,"name":"nazi germany"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"2-Channel film installation as part of 'Untold Stories' exhibition at Kunstverein Grafschaft Bentheim, May 25 - July 2025","release_date":"2025-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
