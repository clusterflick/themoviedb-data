Aidan de Cadenet’s father, Alain, was a legendary race car driver, a man who circled the globe chasing speed in the most coveted vehicles ever built. But of all the cars that passed through his hands, it was this Alfa that captured his soul. In 2003, an unlucky crash on the track sidelined the car — and its story — for over twenty years. But when Aidan dares his father to restore it one final time, what begins as a mechanical resurrection becomes something far deeper. “The Alfa” is a visually rich journey through time, memory, and motion — honoring the timeless beauty of design, and the human stories it quietly carries with it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dtjE18JpvzuI7dq5tWshlcvCnmE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alfa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Dong","original_name":"Lukas Dong","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/muz0xSAes4NWDTH6vn73QkDqaCo.jpg","credit_id":"6949e94002ba77b2d78cec71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dtjE18JpvzuI7dq5tWshlcvCnmE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
