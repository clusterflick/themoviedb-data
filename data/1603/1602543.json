Surrealistic picture with elements of macabre absurdity situation, metaphorical struggle of matter in shaping man and creator. The \"body substance\" slides off the window, like the hero of the film \"The Tenant.\" Paradoxically, another collapse is shaping up a human figure who finally performs a master perfect somersault and strongly lands on the ground. The fully formed pratagonist is Roman Polanski - famous film director.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":135271,"logo_path":null,"name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Krakowie","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masterclass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grażyna Trela","original_name":"Grażyna Trela","popularity":0.4628,"profile_path":"/boV7e7PVhMTqu94MFQ1nR33XuQS.jpg","credit_id":"69498fe8c1eaf926bafb18ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grażyna Trela","original_name":"Grażyna Trela","popularity":0.4628,"profile_path":"/boV7e7PVhMTqu94MFQ1nR33XuQS.jpg","credit_id":"694990c7f948d17d1f812719","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34786889","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lxtyqMQUscjOlEEvJ8VEQzZPZ2P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ULgMZGkbZTNOCz722t4Dhojstz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kraków Film Festival","release_date":"2018-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
