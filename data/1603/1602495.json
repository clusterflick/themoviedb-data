Diane, who is struggling with her mental health, in her late 20s and in a mental health facility where she is getting watched and taken care of 24/7. With her time being in there, she has gained the awareness of how her mental health affects her and the struggles it brings to the state of her life. She makes a connection with some red tulips that were brought to her while she was in the facility; and these tulips were a reminder of her conflicting emotions between the burdens of life and the calm acceptance of death. Bright red tulips induce Diane the freedom that will come with her death. With Diane getting closer to her own death the tulips will make her ready to leave this world. By taking away her life’s desire to not feel, these red flowers have left her helpless before a life force that course through all things.  ","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/vqtQKInOrVsdHSIhi2P7jF2wihF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149798,"logo_path":null,"name":"BA Film Production, University of Portsmouth","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":149797,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Portsmouth","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"},{"english_name":"Welsh","iso_639_1":"cy","name":"Cymraeg"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.\" Sylvia Plath","title":"Lale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Wray","original_name":"Catherine Wray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"69497982c2b88060a27ac44d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5470903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naz Derin Edis","original_name":"Naz Derin Edis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/eKNdbocsjPNjgE1UPyneAljkueu.jpg","credit_id":"69497999b3405d08600735bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5470903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naz Derin Edis","original_name":"Naz Derin Edis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/eKNdbocsjPNjgE1UPyneAljkueu.jpg","credit_id":"694979a46d621584d07ac4f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5470908,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Elen Jones","original_name":"Elen Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694979b1a8960a1909073817","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5470908,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Elen Jones","original_name":"Elen Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694979bea79d0063cd7ac578","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5470903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naz Derin Edis","original_name":"Naz Derin Edis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/eKNdbocsjPNjgE1UPyneAljkueu.jpg","credit_id":"694979de7adf357b4e15584e","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5470903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naz Derin Edis","original_name":"Naz Derin Edis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/eKNdbocsjPNjgE1UPyneAljkueu.jpg","credit_id":"694979f251f19264968ebdd4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5470906,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jess Allen","original_name":"Jess Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69497a0a7f93f41a5d8cebe8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2806,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqtQKInOrVsdHSIhi2P7jF2wihF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":40882,"name":"tulips"},{"id":280617,"name":"student film"},{"id":289859,"name":"lale"},{"id":316974,"name":"film poem"},{"id":337296,"name":"sylvia plath"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
