An adaptation of Pereira’s trial is interwoven with passages from Saint Peter Damian’s passionate 11th-century condemnation of sodomy as an unrepeatable sin in Letter 31 (also known as The Book of Gomorrah), and Walter Benjamin’s iconic elucidations on historicism and progress in Theses on the Philosophy of History. The film revisits the morally and legally charged figure of the sodomite as a violent historical construction and expression of ecclesiastical, institutional, and colonial patriarchy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gZAiCsCkyBPhL6EIT61rR8PcKMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dario Azzellini","original_name":"Dario Azzellini","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zlZgeSpfwPHHFDssj0chSjMT5TP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Saint Peter Damian’s voice","credit_id":"694914c894041a01928128db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2753614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Pascoal","original_name":"Paulo Pascoal","popularity":0.451,"profile_path":"/ocp9wEV8Fr6TCKdf3TYokAf7ggZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"José Francisco Pereira","credit_id":"694914d7c0569d5cb3fb14c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Arthur Peetz","original_name":"John Arthur Peetz","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Monk","credit_id":"694914e3c0569d5cb3fb14c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1800006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicente Wallenstein","original_name":"Vicente Wallenstein","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/cQlnNaAtrJ2saFmrTb7fIoFfmKe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Conquistador","credit_id":"694914f1d303a6bc278eb9df","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211346,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Motta","original_name":"Carlos Motta","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694914a91f1f9300167ac12f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":836,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gZAiCsCkyBPhL6EIT61rR8PcKMj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Galeria Avenida da Índia","release_date":"2018-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
