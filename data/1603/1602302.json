The aerial specters weave a tapestry of surveillance along the maritime border, pioneering the imagination, outlining the vision of sovereignty and order. The detached rhythm of surveillance drones hums in the silent air, casting long shadows on the blue surface of the water in this liminal zone where hope and despair dance together; this indifferent violence casts a deep shadow on the blue surface, its silence more piercing than the primal cries for survival aboard migrant vessels. Yet, these cries are frozen and isolated in front of distant screens, transformed into silent images, silencing the despairing will to live. Are the red dots at sea life jackets or flames?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/quBVEOngI5zfdsNl0QLgiewzjfu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asymmetric Visions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liminal","original_name":"Liminal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69490f507d9897366c8ebb23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Border Forensics","original_name":"Border Forensics","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69490f62cf7b67db108ebd03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/quBVEOngI5zfdsNl0QLgiewzjfu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KIKK Festival","release_date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
