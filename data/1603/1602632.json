The racist grading process of ‘redlining’ primarily black neighborhoods, combined with the displacing effect of various ‘urban renewal’ projects, set the template for the wider scale  gentrification seen today that is pricing black residents of Boston out of their  communities. On top of that, the mass incarceration of Black Bostonians has also led to a further disruption of Black communities. The combined effect of these state sanctioned actions has led to the erasure of Black Americans in Boston.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pukaXt3oRcTe6aoRt2P1LM88kmv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gentrification is removing Black Americans from their communities all across the nation, and Boston is no exception.","title":"REMOVED: Black Erasure in Boston","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Salvati","original_name":"Sabrina Salvati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c5f224937a5336155aec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reggie Stewart","original_name":"Reggie Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c63ea3218202cc812aa5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia Edwards","original_name":"Antonia Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c652ee183a60c88ce98d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wawa Belle","original_name":"Wawa Belle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c66025905827412fc733","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derrick Evans","original_name":"Derrick Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c677728568dbaa8126d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Phelps","original_name":"Kate Phelps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c6b14935b2e332fb181c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Elisa","original_name":"Louis Elisa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c6c43739bb00c62fc57a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Stacey Welch","original_name":"Renee Stacey Welch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c6d3c1eaf926bafb19a7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Singleton","original_name":"Rod Singleton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c6e6d303a6bc278ebd43","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mac Hudson","original_name":"Mac Hudson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c6f19926ecda96b1d113","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yawu Miller","original_name":"Yawu Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6949c702b7631a79bd0739d7","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Salvati","original_name":"Sabrina Salvati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949c4c91869be10850738cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5443996,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Scott Hanshew","original_name":"Scott Hanshew","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949c4db1869be10850738d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893340,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jesse Andrew Clark","original_name":"Jesse Andrew Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949c5443ac49418c4b1d0a7","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39203524","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oUZYhnWVtPXXbbYOYHp5eDMXRpm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pukaXt3oRcTe6aoRt2P1LM88kmv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1680,"name":"boston, massachusetts"},{"id":163082,"name":"gentrification"},{"id":346885,"name":"mass incarceration"},{"id":364408,"name":"redlining"},{"id":364409,"name":"urban renewal"},{"id":364411,"name":"white stadium"},{"id":364412,"name":"franklin park"},{"id":364413,"name":"roxbury"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
