Ken returns to his job as streetlight repairman after the funeral. Having to work at night, he rarely sees his daughter Ann, who develops a fear for darkness since her mother dies. Often left alone at home, she learns to grow up at a tender age. She makes her father agree to go out and play with her on the night of Mid-Autumn Festival, but Ken breaks the promise because of work. During the festive season, father and daughter try hard to re-capture moments of love and concern for each other.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/xeTiAiFw7T9jC1gUw0LZ5ajiXrW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61392,"logo_path":"/e1g54NyBA3ICLice0kKOYHMc84u.png","name":"Fresh Wave","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":61393,"logo_path":"/zBPeWCDSwQ2PDSRHacdt4HPHw3n.png","name":"Hong Kong Arts Development Council","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2018-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3035681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Hui","original_name":"許博文","popularity":0.8756,"profile_path":"/kfp7dQQllBjuRdTVf6AVNHw7qvm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ken","credit_id":"694aa149a8960a1909073c45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5894283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Cheng Sum Yu","original_name":"Emily Cheng Sum Yu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"694aa35bea775d1468b1d1f4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5894227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lam Hei Chun","original_name":"Lam Hei Chun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9b6f9926ecda96b1d402","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5894227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lam Hei Chun","original_name":"Lam Hei Chun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9c3b39d3f33b30812d50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5894238,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ip Wan Sang","original_name":"Ip Wan Sang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9d4d79548cde94812b1a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5835640,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yuen O Miu","original_name":"Yuen O Miu","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694aa067a8960a1909073c1e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10574242","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lrgSASUKEuJZgQemV9SuuUv0lGM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tJy5tS5ovF5fHNDb5XFMNS8DGu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9BwybkCu8tjMnxZkdHOiJpsBxzI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1336,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xeTiAiFw7T9jC1gUw0LZ5ajiXrW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":891}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282133,"name":"father and daughter"},{"id":337827,"name":"single parent family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival 2018","release_date":"2018-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"《燈火》Goodbye 第十二屆鮮浪潮國際短片節（本地競賽）","key":"2uvhZR1ITbE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-13T12:01:25.000Z","id":"694a9a8cc961a0c6cd8ec160"}]}}}
