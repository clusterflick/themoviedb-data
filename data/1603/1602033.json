As pressure mounts, the film slips into his imagination, where Homer appears as a contemporary artist exploited by a ruthless cultural industry that turns vulnerability, suffering, and even death into marketable content. A moment of rebellion and creative freedom unfolds, only to be revealed as a fantasy. Returning to reality, the student remains silent, submits to the imposed framework, and destroys his script. The film explores the cost of obedience and the quiet collapse of artistic freedom.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(H)omerov san","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
