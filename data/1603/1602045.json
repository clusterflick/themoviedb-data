Trying to capture this process naturally leads to an imperfect representation. Embracing this, ‘a puddle of water held in shape by my thoughts’ plays with the materiality of the digital image with the border between digital grain and the movement of the water constantly blurring. This ongoing research project consists of clips recorded over the last two years. - During the Leaving Space exhibition (2024) the work was presented as an installation using an old LCD screen, a wash-stool and other spacial elements. The space where the screen was installed could only be observed from the outside through the glass doors but not entered.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ir0nYbQIUETwYFrZFkYtamHNPgr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An invitation to dwell, linger, lose track of time and reconnect with your thoughts.","title":"A puddle of water held in shape by my thoughts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69488826e77eb5f8c41552f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69488832ea8bcc583bfb1166","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948883ca79d0063cd7ac105","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Heydt","original_name":"Luca Heydt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948884bc961a0c6cd8eb9b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1339,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eyg8cBcKvzrGryXDDtoub1R8kLC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2381}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ir0nYbQIUETwYFrZFkYtamHNPgr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":244417,"name":"art installation"},{"id":258226,"name":"visual poetry"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":271672,"name":"water"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film installation at 'Leaving Space’ Exhibition, Broedplaats Lely in Amsterdam - Sept 21st - Oct 4th 2024","release_date":"2024-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
