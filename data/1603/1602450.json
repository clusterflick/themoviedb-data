I had not been home for 3 years and one of the connections with home was the poems my dad wrote me every day via WeChat. The rivers seemed equally significant for the people in the Netherlands and in Changsha. They are both a romantic connection and an important symbol of daily trade and industry. In a Wechat session my father and I simultaneously read three pairs of poems we wrote for this occasion, he by the Xiang and I by the Lek. Giving the words to the waters that ultimately will meet somewhere in the ocean. The video shows fragments of the performance which took place at the same time in Changsha and Culemborg in June. The full-length documentation is presented as a dual-screen video installation. The three poems written by me can be found on the page \"Writing\".\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/s0SAflKQ5SYPxLFId4z9qzB2zYr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stichting LekArt","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5891099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiyi Chen","original_name":"Yiyi Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfKwhspKbWesphpGww77nYW2QII.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Performer (Daughter)","credit_id":"694963d853a825795c155794","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haoming Chen","original_name":"Haoming Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Performer (Father)","credit_id":"69496605bae8c36a4d8ce98d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5891099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiyi Chen","original_name":"Yiyi Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfKwhspKbWesphpGww77nYW2QII.jpg","credit_id":"694964fc768ed4dfdd8126fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5891099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiyi Chen","original_name":"Yiyi Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfKwhspKbWesphpGww77nYW2QII.jpg","credit_id":"6949650a2cd08a2539073616","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5891099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiyi Chen","original_name":"Yiyi Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfKwhspKbWesphpGww77nYW2QII.jpg","credit_id":"6949651a958d552c457ac418","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5891099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiyi Chen","original_name":"Yiyi Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfKwhspKbWesphpGww77nYW2QII.jpg","credit_id":"69496525f948d17d1f81264a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haoming Chen","original_name":"Haoming Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694966d21f1f9300167ac2d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5891099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiyi Chen","original_name":"Yiyi Chen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zfKwhspKbWesphpGww77nYW2QII.jpg","credit_id":"694966de2ee03d54d91555f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haoming Chen","original_name":"Haoming Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69496730b426a6bc671557e0","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haoming Chen","original_name":"Haoming Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694967405d4fa96ce2155873","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1339,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49aHsxzAIxnq7RNMHyR1EkUuHD3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2381}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s0SAflKQ5SYPxLFId4z9qzB2zYr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1007,"name":"homesickness"},{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":258226,"name":"visual poetry"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"},{"id":328555,"name":"family bonds"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Screened during ‘An evening at the Factory’ at Gelderland Fabriek","release_date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Screened during 'The Night of Film’ at Gelderland Fabriek","release_date":"2023-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rivers (Trailer)","key":"812989191","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-29T22:28:06.000Z","id":"694965927422142406b1cd9d"}]}}}
