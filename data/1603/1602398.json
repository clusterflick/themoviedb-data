After disappearing from prisoner-of-war records, he was presumed dead in Hungary. Because his name was incorrectly recorded in medical documents and he spoke only Hungarian—mistaken by staff for incoherent speech—Toma spent decades misunderstood and isolated in the institution. Fifty-three years later, a visiting Slovak doctor recognised his language, triggering an investigation by Hungarian authorities. Toma was repatriated in 2000, believed to be the last prisoner of war from World War II to return home.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/iUmsSwG7ahcUqQYhpIcqNscmkj2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":284018,"logo_path":null,"name":"BlaisArts
