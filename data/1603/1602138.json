Joining Pavarotti that evening is the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Leone Magiera, the modern day Corale Gioachino Rossini, Modena, directed by Paolo Rossini, and, for the finale, Japanese soprano Atzuko Kawahara. The program combines popular operatic arias and choruses, Neapolitan songs, one of Pavarotti’s own compositions, orchestral overtures and interludes, and a very special duet for the finale.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zOYKRjKrQxGFV16l4gRVMx2YzVs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tibor Rudas Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pavarotti: The Lost Concert - Live at Llangollen 1995","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Pavarotti","original_name":"Luciano Pavarotti","popularity":0.2699,"profile_path":"/p9TlGSfQ4NNW54TL16zOe9gvXJx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tenor","credit_id":"6948c886eb0466f518fb150a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Rossini","original_name":"Paolo Rossini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Director - Corale Gioachino Rossini, Modena","credit_id":"6948c8d0c1eaf926bafb1435","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atzuko Kawahara","original_name":"Atzuko Kawahara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"6948c8edc1eaf926bafb1442","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2540332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leone Magiera","original_name":"Leone Magiera","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/kZNVnG5YyErSCisFaHJSg9WaDpQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"BBC Philharmonic (Conductor)","credit_id":"6948c91351d9a2755a8126fe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2402041,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Nolan","original_name":"David Nolan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2AwKHfy1i1xpvdY8EUhFhn41YgC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"BBC Philharmonic (Leader)","credit_id":"6948c942c2cfd514a37ac3a4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050307,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wayne Baruch","original_name":"Wayne Baruch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948c97b958d552c457ac190","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Rossini","original_name":"Paolo Rossini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948cbca7422142406b1caa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paolo Rossini","original_name":"Paolo Rossini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948cbd57f93f41a5d8ce8f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5JtW0vJOcEP8QaPlrde2esIUwT4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zOYKRjKrQxGFV16l4gRVMx2YzVs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pavarotti 90 - The Lost Concert (Live at Llangollen, 1995)","key":"ykSWxNe93fw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-11-21T07:41:22.000Z","id":"6948cb9b7f93f41a5d8ce8df"}]}}}
