The results of their actions are astounding: in 30 years they enabled the creation and expansion of 18 national parks between Chile and Argentina, covering a total area of 7 million hectares, equivalent to the size of a country like Ireland.  By transforming these spaces and reconstructing natural ecosystems, the development of these parks has also enabled the creation of social bonds, developed a new form of economic activity, brought forth a political space, and contributed to strengthening the population’s sense of belonging to their territories.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/i15LWTAGmdtQi0wOIYXUnyccvjN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":284024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Into the Rewild","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rewilding Patagonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3952161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristine Tompkins","original_name":"Kristine Tompkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/A4slqgRlU5kf4ekjBsX6JpF9zMD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6949a99bc2b88060a27ac5a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurélie Miquel Hiltzer","original_name":"Aurélie Miquel Hiltzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949a83d3a9b0e837407388e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Hiltzer","original_name":"Arnaud Hiltzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949a85bea775d1468b1cf33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893172,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jonathan Mille","original_name":"Jonathan Mille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949a8d4ea775d1468b1cf41","department":"Art","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893175,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alexandra Locquet","original_name":"Alexandra Locquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949a8ecd44920a6037ac837","department":"Art","job":"Other"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i15LWTAGmdtQi0wOIYXUnyccvjN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":799}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6460,"name":"chile"},{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":314442,"name":"patagonia"},{"id":317123,"name":"rewilding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
