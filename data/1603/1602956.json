In this imagined future, the story revolves around three aliens whose deep friendship unfolds in a world dominated by military rule and stringent restrictions. Through this work, Aida Ra Mana poses profound questions about resilience and the human spirit. How do we create joy and humor when faced with pervasive limitations and diminished opportunities? What does it mean to nurture friendship and creativity in an environment where one must constantly conceal their magic and beliefs from an authoritarian regime? By blending elements of science fiction with poignant social commentary, Aida Ra Mana's universe serves as a mirror to our own society's challenges and a testament to the enduring power of joy and laughter in the face of adversity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bGlRCNnfQNjUodQZF7GiFAqpHLL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2044","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ra Mana","original_name":"Aida Ra Mana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9c51d36bff9d442fc802","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894234,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sofia Kaabu","original_name":"Sofia Kaabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9c76c0569d5cb3fb1b2b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ra Mana","original_name":"Aida Ra Mana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9c8da6394c2ad2fb1d10","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894235,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Saphira Nancy","original_name":"Saphira Nancy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9cbfaf47521cee0744a4","department":"Art","job":"Concept Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894235,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Saphira Nancy","original_name":"Saphira Nancy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9cda3a9b0e8374073be1","department":"Art","job":"Set Dresser"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894234,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sofia Kaabu","original_name":"Sofia Kaabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9ced39bcb5bff8b1d1cc","department":"Art","job":"Set Dresser"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ra Mana","original_name":"Aida Ra Mana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9cfe3ac49418c4b1d2fe","department":"Art","job":"Set Dresser"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ra Mana","original_name":"Aida Ra Mana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9d17797990b0368cebb2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ra Mana","original_name":"Aida Ra Mana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9d296b4ff0c5b0073b88","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ra Mana","original_name":"Aida Ra Mana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9d3353fa4b5e778ec22b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894239,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Lehlohonolo Tlhaole-Tefo","original_name":"Lehlohonolo Tlhaole-Tefo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9d61af47521cee0744b8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"3D Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5894240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phantom Wizard","original_name":"Phantom Wizard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694a9d75527d4cf069fb1b68","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1339,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8G9CIZk7rKHRV6zPThZiS8Gs53K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2381}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bGlRCNnfQNjUodQZF7GiFAqpHLL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":214775,"name":"afrofuturism"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":274424,"name":"talkshow"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gerrit Rietveld Academy Graduation Show 2024 _ July 3-7, 2024","release_date":"2024-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
