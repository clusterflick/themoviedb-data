This multi-media project took the form of twelve 100x65cm illustrations, 4 per relationship, an EP released as Pink Boah (Zalmroze in collaboration with Jerboah) and three experimental films backed by the three title tracks from the Pink Boah EP. Each of the three films is a self-projected character study, with the three relationships being depicted and acted out, by the artist and a placeholder model, through physical performance and touch. Visually it is most in line with the artist’s photographic series \"The Gaze Upon The Male Gaze”, made for Sauce Magazine, with both the films and that photo series being highly sexploitative in nature.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gcCboJPOBMu9JTQYroMkcKvqgoH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5893685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Stender","original_name":"Christian Stender","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ex-Lover 3","credit_id":"6949f3d32cfe8cfc7a2fc80a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fictionalized Self","credit_id":"6949f3e2bba2840a8a812b5b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6949f3f4eb0466f518fb1ad5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6949f3ffd49dde55e5fb167b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6949f408eb0466f518fb1ad8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6949f41851d9a2755a812ca4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6949f4201f1f9300167ac572","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zalmroze","original_name":"Zalmroze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949f4316b4ff0c5b0073945","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angélique Farge","original_name":"Angélique Farge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6949f43fedfc44b8a97ac73b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcCboJPOBMu9JTQYroMkcKvqgoH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1346,"name":"dance performance"},{"id":5699,"name":"music video"},{"id":10053,"name":"sexploitation"},{"id":157096,"name":"homoeroticism"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"},{"id":362757,"name":"sensual"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Screened during exhibition at Gerrit Rietveld Academy - June 12-14, 2017","release_date":"2017-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Screened during exhibition at Gerrit Rietveld Academy - June 12-14, 2017","release_date":"2017-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Screened during exhibition at Gerrit Rietveld Academy - June 12-14, 2017","release_date":"2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
