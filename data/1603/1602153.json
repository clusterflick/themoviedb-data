When a demented priest hires him to “cleanse” the taxidermied corpse of a teenage girl housed in his grotesque attic shrine, Anderson spirals into a surreal and morally decayed underworld where the dead speak louder than the living. Haunted by memories of a lost love and taunted by the city’s sticky, inescapable heat, he finds himself caught between delusion and damnation, chasing salvation in a city that stopped believing in it a long time ago.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Louisana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sreya Halder","original_name":"Sreya Halder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rosemary","credit_id":"6948d586128330a241b1caed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Haera","original_name":"Anthony Haera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948d59e1b3349feaf8ce67b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linamaria Gonzalez","original_name":"Linamaria Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948d5ad89e2aa8f5507358b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linamaria Gonzalez","original_name":"Linamaria Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948d5c6b426a6bc671555fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Haera","original_name":"Anthony Haera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948d5d5e5069b831d7ac144","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4005690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sannette Gaia","original_name":"Sannette Gaia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hO0AhVo9Ni1eeHbLLlpwZWx3C6k.jpg","credit_id":"6948d5e66fae3c26ea8eb9c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892002,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anson Mak","original_name":"Anson Mak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948d675d36bff9d442fc216","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5892005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Park","original_name":"Ashley Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948d6967561f486e281248d","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
