Three decades after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mirza, Zlatan, and Hamza are the next generation of athletes in a country facing an uncertain future. The tensions of the past still loom large in these young Muslims’ lives, and their Olympic dreams are stunted by a lack of state support despite the efforts of their dedicated coach. Director Ryan Sidhoo takes a longitudinal approach in his directorial debut, intimately capturing the boys’ journey as they reckon with growing up under the shadow of the past. A deeply affecting coming-of-age underdog story, The Track is an ode to the power of hope, friendship, and chasing your dreams against all odds.","popularity":0.9478,"poster_path":"/lgMLhAYOuDqzw5xb5AbG3zgsWH5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2025-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Track","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirza Nikolajev","original_name":"Mirza Nikolajev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a6ac821729ffa1cae05270","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zlatan Jakić","original_name":"Zlatan Jakić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a6ac9a1c0f3abf87e05588","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamza Pleho","original_name":"Hamza Pleho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a6acbc1729ffa1cae0528c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5214878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senad Omanović","original_name":"Senad Omanović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67a6acfbde283c900ec89270","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Sidhoo","original_name":"Ryan Sidhoo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6ab3ede283c900ec891e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Sidhoo","original_name":"Ryan Sidhoo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6ab4ede283c900ec891f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Sidhoo","original_name":"Ryan Sidhoo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6ab5b1729ffa1cae05214","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Graham Withers","original_name":"Graham Withers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6ab96de283c900ec89212","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Graham Withers","original_name":"Graham Withers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6aba358d93cefedc89999","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmina Djikoli","original_name":"Jasmina Djikoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6abd81729ffa1cae05242","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1807513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse McCracken","original_name":"Jesse McCracken","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6ac13de283c900ec8922d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35699183","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lgMLhAYOuDqzw5xb5AbG3zgsWH5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":281135,"name":"olympic sport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"True / False Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
