The protagonist of the film is Wiesław Mrzygłód, a musician and artist. He has an extraordinarily positive attitude to the world, life, and music. In the 1980s, together with the Old Dixieland Players, he played at the most important jazz events in Poland and Europe. Despite doctors' opinions, he says, \"Someday, I will play again.\" He refuses to give up.  The film was made using analog and combined techniques, based on drawing using oil pastels, prints, and re-filming methods.","popularity":0.2825,"poster_path":"/yHlpEnrOZlCbRSM53deyMUkcbJZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72891,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Someday Again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiesław Mrzygłód","original_name":"Wiesław Mrzygłód","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"67a5e8901fcbfee54d30013c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kajetan Łukasz Pochylski","original_name":"Kajetan Łukasz Pochylski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5e8541f6b3834ff2fd2d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kajetan Łukasz Pochylski","original_name":"Kajetan Łukasz Pochylski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5e86a937d2e9b6066ce7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kajetan Łukasz Pochylski","original_name":"Kajetan Łukasz Pochylski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5e87b1f6b3834ff2fd2e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226472,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bartosz Jaworski","original_name":"Bartosz Jaworski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5e8a0937d2e9b6066cea3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AkMeKNT8a0FdvUTTaK1Kx1VeCF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3HFhoQKJWYyG53QMGYnpHKvanXj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fIwuq4uynNDIVw4giMugk3S6epd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xZwOCshmU3dR9TeEkkS3k5TsbNs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yHlpEnrOZlCbRSM53deyMUkcbJZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":239463,"name":"film archives"},{"id":296071,"name":"experimental documentary"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
