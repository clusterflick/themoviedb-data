As the growing economic pie is divided up by the powers, the only thing left for us to do is to stand up for our unwatered lands, barely breathable polluted air, and our right to living in a carcinogen-free environment. Dark Atlas maps out the fight against the current and planned plants from Yırca to Şırnak. The documentary is a passionate effort to show the community of voices that were raised in different regions and how we say the same things in different languages as we fight to protect our lives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qxDdF1ClkoZxSITQ8Wssbi4e6ve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2016-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dark Atlas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4210309,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Umut Vedat","original_name":"Umut Vedat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d68f937d2e9b6066cbc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4210309,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Umut Vedat","original_name":"Umut Vedat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d6964dc052ba5585e4a6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231112,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hazal Yüksel","original_name":"Hazal Yüksel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d6a24dc052ba5585e4b3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231113,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Reşit Elçin","original_name":"Reşit Elçin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d6c34dc052ba5585e4c8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4210309,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Umut Vedat","original_name":"Umut Vedat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d6ca4d536cb93266de1a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231113,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Reşit Elçin","original_name":"Reşit Elçin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d6f1c1e5ed8bfc85dcd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4210309,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Umut Vedat","original_name":"Umut Vedat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d6fdc1e5ed8bfc85dcdb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3299532,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emre Can Öziş","original_name":"Emre Can Öziş","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5d710c1e5ed8bfc85dcf4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5210346","wikidata_id":"Q26835893","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qxDdF1ClkoZxSITQ8Wssbi4e6ve.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":841}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Engelsiz Filmler Festivali 2017","release_date":"2017-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
