With his career in freefall and worried his Hollywood days are behind him, he heads to England, hoping to rebuild his image as a serious actor on the West End. But his long-suffering agent has other plans, sending Bradley instead to a small, snow-dusted village to star in the town’s eccentric production of ‘Cinderella.’ As he fumbles through rehearsals with
