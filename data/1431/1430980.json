Land With No Rider centers on four cattle ranchers who know this region of the Mimbres River Valley like the back of their hands. As they speak about their lives, their ruminations often linger like poetry, noting the sound of snow falling or singing softly along with the radio. They rise with the sun and still tend to their herds at dusk, the soft purple hues tingeing the light as the ranchers reflect on the possibility of being the last of their generation to work this land. Director Tamar Lando’s transportive vérité portrait of the often solitary yet beautiful world of these ranchers is part oral history, part patient ode to a valley in transition.","popularity":0.1124,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land With No Rider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamar Lando","original_name":"Tamar Lando","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b58cdcf75afbe2f0f8e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2704981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamar Lando","original_name":"Tamar Lando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b597f5aaa6afa9e0536f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hunter Robert Baker","original_name":"Hunter Robert Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b5c6269f0bc4f5f0fc84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith Mizrachy","original_name":"Judith Mizrachy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b5de269f0bc4f5f0fc8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232760,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carolina Costa","original_name":"Carolina Costa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b5f6269f0bc4f5f0fc9d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043985,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gareth Paul Cox","original_name":"Gareth Paul Cox","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b604e4bd02e64ce04f1d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106909,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brad Fuller","original_name":"Brad Fuller","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b61df5aaa6afa9e053b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816454,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zev Rand","original_name":"Zev Rand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b674571d707f14c89928","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1108491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beth Levison","original_name":"Beth Levison","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b68ff5aaa6afa9e053cc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305099,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carrie Lozano","original_name":"Carrie Lozano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6b6a5dcf75afbe2f0f97c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35670146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"True / False Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
