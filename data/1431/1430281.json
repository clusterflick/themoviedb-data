In 2002 he responded to a request from the National Gallery in London and decided to move to the capital and paint the city itself. The project took over two years to complete; this film follows the artist at work from Greenwich to Trafalgar Square; and includes witnesses such as Lord Rothschild, Frank Auerbach and Charlie Gillett. The result is a unique and intimate portrait of the painterâ€™s working life.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kMJn2x0ViIlVhZ6jOvU2nCzHYda.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Virtue: London","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0478866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2176,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMJn2x0ViIlVhZ6jOvU2nCzHYda.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1451}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
