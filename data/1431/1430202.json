It was a quick way of finding out whether there was anybody lost from their family.  In June 1999 Lala Meredith-Vula (whose father is from Kosova) was invited by the British Red Cross to go in to Kosova shortly after the liberation and end of the NATO bombing. She witnessed the country torn and desolate gradually come back to life again. It is an artist’s deeply personal study about people surviving adversity and carrying on. The film shows the indomitability of the human spirit.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Are You Everybody?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5230098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lala Meredith-Vula","original_name":"Lala Meredith-Vula","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5195343781b4bfa2feb10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
