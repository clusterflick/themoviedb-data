Relocated to a specially constructed niche on the front of a former schoolhouse in 1844, the clock has undergone restorations in 1977 and 2004 and has remained a constant presence throughout Dan Guthrie’s life in Stroud. Empty Alcove is one of two newly commissioned videos that put forward the ‘radical un-conservation’ of the clock—a new theoretical concept proposed by Guthrie to describe the acquisition of an object with the express intent to destroy it. Central to this new body of work are questions about what society chooses to memorialise and how we do so.","popularity":0.1708,"poster_path":"/lAIYfbDkpeZUwxHku7DyOmHjHBI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100211,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spike Island","origin_country":""},{"id":100212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chisenhale Gallery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empty Alcove","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Guthrie","original_name":"Dan Guthrie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6343faca91da4ba85e7cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231757,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Holly Antrum","original_name":"Holly Antrum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6344a0ca6bfa8042fc2e5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4300530,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"felix taylor","original_name":"felix taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a63459aca91da4ba85e7de","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4300530,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"felix taylor","original_name":"felix taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a63461df336f38ab85f410","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787114,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nielsan Bohl","original_name":"Nielsan Bohl","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6346ddf336f38ab85f418","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231758,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivia Aherne","original_name":"Olivia Aherne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6347eaca91da4ba85e7e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231759,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmen Juliá","original_name":"Carmen Juliá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6348b8dbb4c09906702d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lAIYfbDkpeZUwxHku7DyOmHjHBI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spike Island, Bristol, UK","release_date":"2025-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
