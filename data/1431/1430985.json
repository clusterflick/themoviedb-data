She sets out to search for the story of her great-grandfather and, in the process, discovers the land that generations before her cultivated alongside the cave dwellings that they called home. Here she pays tribute to her family’s heritage, bearing witness to its relationship with the land, labor, and resilience. A shapeshifting and playful feature debut, the film is infused with performance, poetry, and animation as Zhao constructs a living archive of oral history and community theater. Summoning the past into the present, May the Soil Be Everywhere chronicles China’s history of war, famine, and rapid urbanization through the lens of four generations in one family.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/o8FJy1NPnGDAzxV0Xo79aGzioyK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May the Soil Be Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yehui Zhao","original_name":"Yehui Zhao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6bb78ad2758bac5f0fdd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232811,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fenge Yuan","original_name":"Fenge Yuan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6bb9058d93cefedc89b78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yehui Zhao","original_name":"Yehui Zhao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6bba1ad2758bac5f0fde6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5232814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Felsher","original_name":"Andrew Felsher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6bbbae4bd02e64ce050ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2796644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Véronique Bernard","original_name":"Véronique Bernard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6bbd7571d707f14c89ae3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3318348,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gisburg Smialek","original_name":"Gisburg Smialek","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a6bc4aad2758bac5f0fe25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1235,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o8FJy1NPnGDAzxV0Xo79aGzioyK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":835}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"True / False Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
