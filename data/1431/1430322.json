As part of the campaign, a series of films was released along with a companion book.  Each installment covers a different disaster scenario, including tornadoes, blizzards, earthquakes, forest fires, blackouts and a nuclear disaster.  The California Department of Education helped produce the films and hosted a workshop of educational professionals to discuss the best ways to present the desired emergency preparedness information to school age audiences.  The process was filmed and assembled, along with clips from each production, and distributed as an Instructor's Guide in 1975.","popularity":0.2214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":224509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Defense Civil Preparedness Agency","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Chance to Live: An Instructor's Guide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5096,"name":"natural disaster"},{"id":3852,"name":"safety"},{"id":162257,"name":"instructor"},{"id":241542,"name":"public safety"},{"id":345320,"name":"public information"},{"id":346504,"name":"preparedness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Your Chance to Live: Instructor's Guide","key":"fSmVHWVIq6w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-16T01:04:23.000Z","id":"67a55d7f8dbb4c099066ed5a"}]}}}
