Funded and Produced by the ethical adult company Erika Lust Films, An Illicit Affair stars two exceptionally talented, Berlin-based performers in a film of intimacy, release and deception. Bishop Black and Jasko Fide are married - but not to each other. They regularly meet in secret houses or borrowed apartments to indulge in a re-kindled love, a spark never lost from their youth, and exploring sexual desires outside of the heteronormative roles they are forced to lead in real life. Delicately shot with Goodyn's natural talent and eye for light, watch Bishop and Jasko fall in love, lust, and lies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aziYXJ8BYrENJIeFOsS8wWhxA6h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Illicit Affair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aziYXJ8BYrENJIeFOsS8wWhxA6h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
