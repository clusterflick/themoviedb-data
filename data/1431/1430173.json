Produced without a script or shooting schedule, the film lies somewhere between a home movie and documentary. It integrates chance and discontinuity, repeats the same sequences in loops, alternates between color and black and white, and is interspersed with frames that are empty, blurry, or reversed. The soundtrack consists of an improvised monologue by Bruce Baillie which unfolds without interruption, following his discontinuous flow of thought.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/dD34DydDbaezvVvJonL6OyKnY8T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Kind of Thing - He and Us (Bruce Baillie)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Baillie","original_name":"Bruce Baillie","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/gV1ezFXy2xzLJXvqug8rafWtJPC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67a509fdbf36040c5d85d213","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5229972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Anderwald","original_name":"Ruth Anderwald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a509ce5088b945972fdd7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dD34DydDbaezvVvJonL6OyKnY8T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
