It's about change, personal growth and self reflection. With a silhouette style I wanted to enlarge the effect for the viewer of identifying yourself with the character/situation. To create a feeling of acceptance and relief, hopefully motivating them. The film is really built on metaphors. A lot is 'foreshadowed' so that the viewer hopefully understands what it all means at the end, just like a title sequence for a series for example, only then as a short film. The title also has sort of role in the film, changing as the character confronts his fear.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109227,"logo_path":null,"name":"HKU University of the Arts Utrecht","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Wind","original_name":"Thomas Wind","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5e4485088b945972ff9c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231189,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon Rob","original_name":"Jon Rob","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a5e5001fcbfee54d30009d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
