In this engaging and lavishly illustrated interview he talks about the context within which the book was conceived, its main themes, and how its original thesis relates to the contemporary understanding of \"the Orient\" as represented in the mass media.  \"That's the power of the discourse of Orientalism. If you're thinking about people and Islam, and about that part of the world, those are the words you constantly have to use. To think past it, to go beyond it, not to use it, is virtually impossible, because there is no knowledge that isn't codified in this way about that part of the world.\" -Edward Said","popularity":0.5606,"poster_path":"/y2EkbdjBpVFBjAO5nHRZS0VcxI3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward Said On Orientalism: \"The Orient\" Represented in Mass Media","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":968931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Said","original_name":"Edward Said","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/wHNc2SVnLtXbBrp4ogvlhYTgUJv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65334a6c0d11f200ff8be55c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"65569d80d4fe0400ac36def5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332122,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Smith","original_name":"Jeremy Smith","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3f877e7c097017dd07d25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4331373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sanjay Talrej","original_name":"Sanjay Talrej","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3f89e2fe2fa01842ab2c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":904,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y2EkbdjBpVFBjAO5nHRZS0VcxI3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":602}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":3060,"name":"race politics"},{"id":40870,"name":"race"},{"id":198555,"name":"orientalism"},{"id":324072,"name":"ethnicity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
