Drawing on excerpts from obscure sci-fi films, The Electric Kiss imagines a world not unlike our own, in which people plug their brains into a kind of neuro-network that connects the whole of human consciousness. As cyberpunk imagery draped in VHS textures alternates with passages of prismatic visual noise (achieved, in trademark style, by feeding footage through self trained machine learning algorithms), a quasi-plot emerges: a man in a VR headset, literally and figuratively lost in space, subjects himself to a mysterious procedure to alleviate the ill effects of this new technology on the mind.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/zTiTTI9tnYHSK6RBJdq3fxQCugX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Electric Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Kohlberger","original_name":"Rainer Kohlberger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/jjWzhTAlXBjaNPkFJiL7JnklBAp.jpg","credit_id":"65313320c439c000e175f210","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Kohlberger","original_name":"Rainer Kohlberger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/jjWzhTAlXBjaNPkFJiL7JnklBAp.jpg","credit_id":"661059fb20ecaf0186167fe0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jung an Tagen","original_name":"Jung an Tagen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66105a178dbc33017df2f0de","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zTiTTI9tnYHSK6RBJdq3fxQCugX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
