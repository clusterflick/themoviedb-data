Tikhon Pendurin’s piece “Death of Cinema” is a dream of a film, the process of falling asleep, a frozen cosmos, the liturgy of a sigh. Fotogénie, a return to the forgotten magic of magician Segundo de Chomon, the mystery of Val del Omar, Alain Resnais surreal theatricality “Death of Cinema” seems to absorb all the magic of cinema and confesses its own forgetfulness. The characters of “Death of Cinema” stand before the justice of truth, naive children turned with pride away from the audience. Here, the main thing is the hallucination of light, a whisper, a prayer, the bewildered physiognomy of cinema, which allowed itself to laugh at its own seriousness.
