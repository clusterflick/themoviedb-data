A child goes off to school and must reevaluate everything they have known. Fish, dogs, cats & birds interact with fish tanks, living room furniture, poppies, school busses and the first artificial heart technology. They morph and combine with one another, changing masks and creating new creatures in the strangely internalized and claustrophobic environment that they inhabit. Relationships between the objects, animals and sound create a commentary on seeing and invisibility as experienced by the body. The menacing feeling of animalistic predators and prey seeps into every scene, as odd sexual metaphors manifest with alien-like qualities. Everything points against one of the narrative claims that, “Nothing ever happened.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing ever happened","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4327975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jess MacCormack","original_name":"Jess MacCormack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65309c52aede5900e98e7f11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Arseneault","original_name":"Jordan Arseneault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65309c7aaede59010afec96e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Spencer-Cross","original_name":"Nathan Spencer-Cross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65309c8faede5900e98e7f39","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4327975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jess MacCormack","original_name":"Jess MacCormack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65309c1251a64e00aba00b78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
