A country with a pleasant climate and green and eye-catching areas hosts millions of tourists from all over the world every year in spring. New Zealand is a country in the southwest of the Pacific Ocean, which consists of two large islands and two small islands. New Zealand is far from the dry region, so the country of Australia is the closest country to this region, 2 thousand kilometers away from this country. The majority of the population of this country is made up of English and Irish immigrants.  NB - This movie has no voice overs, and includes a second \"natural surround sounds\" soundtrack without the music.","popularity":0.0591,"poster_path":"/jOsbM4Hq25ceAaOp0UHnn6ckQ2s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melody of the Spring - New Zealand","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Melody of the Spring - New Zealand","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"大地之诗春新西兰","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jOsbM4Hq25ceAaOp0UHnn6ckQ2s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
