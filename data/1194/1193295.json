To create this Catholic place, at the beginning of the 1950s, Le Corbusier was inspired by the mosque of the Algerian Sahara of Sidi Brahim, by a crab shell for the shapes of the roof, and by the nearby Vosges valleys. .. Multiple influences for a building full of contradictions, a mixture of round and square lines, slender or squat depending on the angle of view, apparently vast from the outside, but small and intimate from the threshold crossed.\r Both a place of contemplation and major architectural innovation, the Chapelle de Ronchamp has been listed as a Historic Monument since 1965. Labeled “Heritage of the 20th century” in 1999, it entered the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2016 with 16 others works of Le Corbusier.","popularity":0.3979,"poster_path":"/4XG803b6VywM9uc38CaWvukHwC6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artès Films","origin_country":""},{"id":211391,"logo_path":null,"name":"Procinebel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Chapelle de Ronchamp","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","original_name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/iTbPg7CJmkPzZkTJUpWgCOk83p2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Commentary","credit_id":"6530dede7eb5f200e496169b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Desailly","original_name":"Jean Desailly","popularity":0.2835,"profile_path":"/fMR14DvAHQE0Ruv34alWv49VNKV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6530deef51a64e00c8fdc4e7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330412,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques de Casembroot","original_name":"Jacques de Casembroot","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530debcaede5900ac01336d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596534,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dany Gérard","original_name":"Dany Gérard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530e15130f79c01380ea2e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38113,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Étienne Szabo","original_name":"Étienne Szabo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677970b9c11ee61dd874de36","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1058070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lqudQuiKuiWdrI8Er11Q0hLTRxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jcjzWl2VlBJ7OWZbVgCGFgscgfa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vaJmjnw96XMF1nwnEuI4mMIqtjk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYPWngBPTM21PrvqvZ1O9mquKmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lIVQUy4FvqqQcqvMThSnWnbMhmb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XG803b6VywM9uc38CaWvukHwC6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":265477,"name":"modern architecture"},{"id":315150,"name":"sacred architecture"},{"id":323984,"name":"le corbusier"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
