This is followed by the image of an ear. Someone tastes food, another uses his nose, looking for a specific smell. A couple of massaging hands work bare skin. The film follows people who use their senses to get an idea or a sensation. The composer utilises his hearing to draw inspiration from everyday sounds. A passionate cook tastes his dishes until he is satisfied. A 'corpse sniffer' deploys his keen sense of smell to locate missing victims of criminal acts. The astronomer uses strong lenses to search the star system for new elements, while a blind man threads his way through traffic. Chaotic city noises accompany an image of what he can barely see. His tactile sense is miraculously strong. The occasional voice-over complements this ingeniously edited exploration of sensory perceptions.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":211547,"logo_path":null,"name":"VOF Appel & Honigmann","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2009-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deuren naar de ziel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3373880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Rocha Salgado","original_name":"Elizabeth Rocha Salgado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532efcfefe37c0101395efa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Appel","original_name":"John Appel","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532f00defe37c00c7ec2397","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713262,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marty de Jong","original_name":"Marty de Jong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532f01eefe37c00c7ec23a4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1007630,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Boris Gerrets","original_name":"Boris Gerrets","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532f02f9ac53508752f7b08","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7285088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
