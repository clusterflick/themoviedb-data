Executive produced by three women with hearing loss, the documentary was conceived, filmed and directed across two continents, all during the COVID-19 pandemic.  When you have hearing loss, conversation is like a game of Wheel of Fortune. Some of the letters are blank. Others are filled in. People with hearing loss take these incomplete sounds and put them into words or phrases that make sense in the context of the conversation. It doesn't always work, leaving people isolated and alone. The pandemic made this worse, as masks took away their superpower - lipreading. People with hearing loss struggle to fit into the hearing world, yet there is a silver lining - meeting one another.  —Shari Eberts","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We Hear You, Now Hear Us","title":"We Hear You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxana Rotundo","original_name":"Roxana Rotundo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6530a1dc51a64e010a8b3932","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shari Eberts","original_name":"Shari Eberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6530a1fec439c000e175abe8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Cohen","original_name":"Holly Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6530a266c439c000e175ac38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Iacolucci","original_name":"Toni Iacolucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6530a28f1108a8010be862be","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029887,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carolina Cordero","original_name":"Carolina Cordero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530a2cff1759c00ff99d82c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxana Rotundo","original_name":"Roxana Rotundo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530a43faede59012b3146e4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shari Eberts","original_name":"Shari Eberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530a40a1108a8014d35435e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729478,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julián Sanguinetti","original_name":"Julián Sanguinetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530a3d37eb5f2011e578aa4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328073,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Corinne Kohmescher","original_name":"Corinne Kohmescher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530a37f7eb5f2011e578a79","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Cohen","original_name":"Holly Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6530a3fdf1759c01394b0a6c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15109208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
