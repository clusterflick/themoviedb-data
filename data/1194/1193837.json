Marcela is a prestigious architect, who returns to the country after separating from her American husband. Claudio, actor and bohemian, seeks inspiration to write a work that will finally take him out of anonymity. While the brothers wait for the investors to arrive, they notice that in their absence, the old landlord Ramón - who raised them since they were children - has taken over the house and rents it out for different activities. From this crossroads, The Landlord delves into the ties, frustrations and the need to make peace with the past.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/969kXOQkIvhxlh7XW5KWnu92dEU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amada
