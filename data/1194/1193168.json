If most people know his great achievements, such as the Cité radieuse of Marseille, the pavilions of the Cité universitaire de Paris or the Tourettes convent, many are unaware of his works in Moscow, Rio de Janeiro or Chandigarh. Roy Oppenheim pays a vibrant tribute to Corbusier, dismissing the criticisms and darker facets of the character. It presents the career of this pioneering architect, as well as his thinking, the essential principle of which was aimed at the development of human beings and the balance of society. Light, space and greenery are integrated into his large futuristic cities, because according to him the eyes of the inhabitants should be drawn into the distance and not into their neighbor's bathroom.","popularity":0.5623,"poster_path":"/qFeLRhBPiJbiuJ4alTt1EJtoHS0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Corbusier","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","original_name":"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/iTbPg7CJmkPzZkTJUpWgCOk83p2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65305d389d592c010d3703cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4327879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Wogenscky","original_name":"André Wogenscky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ditIOSLDRGPObqrmkcHdnx3CNzi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"653061d9945d3600ca27145e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2926009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Weber","original_name":"Heidi Weber","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/qlndRL6xQ2Gy08HXCkIWD5SlIBG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6530615a945d3600adc96c01","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3217917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Oppenheim","original_name":"Roy Oppenheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/54ne7GRfQwdu7ZNqwMWiIIEyXjx.jpg","credit_id":"65305d109d592c010d3703b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29544969","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/blRYGRx4QKW3xjWLviE4WyHsxtO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oswOs1f7HgnYznidc9SUPiM86tf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qFeLRhBPiJbiuJ4alTt1EJtoHS0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2985,"name":"designer"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":273638,"name":"mid century modern"},{"id":323984,"name":"le corbusier"},{"id":323985,"name":"modulor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
