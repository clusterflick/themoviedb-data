Unparalleled, his music is performed all over the world from the Bolshoi Theatre and Paris’s Opéra Garnier to Milan’s La Scala and New York’s Carnegie Hall. While he usually shuns publicity, this time, he will open up to share some of his innermost thoughts. From the genius’s weekday routine and musings to the bold premiere involving the iconic conductor Teodor Currentzis, this movie is an attempt at unraveling the enigma that is the paradox of the composer’s music and persona.","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":"/h9PzKQOQddjobNgdzJRdXeta7ra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock
