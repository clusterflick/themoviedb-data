Originally from Donetsk - an industrial city in eastern Ukraine - the family was uprooted in 2014 when the Russian war against Ukraine first commenced. By 2022, the same enemy once again began knocking on the door of their new home -which was now in Kyiv- and once again destroyed everything that the family had worked so hard to rebuild. Thrown into the limbo of exile, the director (she is also the narrator of the film) dives into a kaleidoscope of memories and chronicles both her personal and collective familial search for something to hold on to amid these turbulent times.","popularity":0.1738,"poster_path":"/yJHBEzt4kAIlteOxdBEiaZ9Whl0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Real
