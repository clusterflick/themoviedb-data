The greatest brass band festival in Europe is in GUCA. Paradoxically, it is a backwoods village located in the very heart of Serbia, but it beats with a passion and rhythm that unites the whole world. The whole region is a unique place where East meets West and the North borders with the South. The Celtic rhythm, a southern warmth, the Latin romanticism, and the Slavic sentimentality is present everywhere. It radiates within the culture, the food, the people and the music. The festival has been around for for the last 55 years. By its size and vibe it has often been compared with Woodstock and the Festival in Rio. About half a million people come to visit every year and they stay for a week during the month of August. What is really magical is that everyone feels rejuvenated after spending day and night in this place. No matter how long your trip will be, you will always want to come again.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1Ze3mPDvfLcwwoSzk84XRuc7nDU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rados Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GUCA: Serbian Detox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"GUČA: Serbian Detox","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Göran Christensen","original_name":"Göran Christensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653142607eb5f2011e57ccd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teodora Kostić","original_name":"Teodora Kostić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6531426af1759c00c5c49404","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saša Krstić","original_name":"Saša Krstić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653142721108a800eaafe5af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikola Stojić","original_name":"Nikola Stojić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6531427c30f79c00ab7b9daf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Predrag Tanasković","original_name":"Predrag Tanasković","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6531428a7eb5f2013bae0fd4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danijela Veselinović","original_name":"Danijela Veselinović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6531429451a64e010a8b80d3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4328728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoran Vučićević","original_name":"Zoran Vučićević","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6531429e51a64e010a8b80e2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Stephen Rados","original_name":"Igor Stephen Rados","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653142d47eb5f200e4963c3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Stephen Rados","original_name":"Igor Stephen Rados","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65314251c439c000acbb041a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5734130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Ze3mPDvfLcwwoSzk84XRuc7nDU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
