The year begins by changing lead singers, musical style and image, which was a shock to their fan base. They were ultimately well received by playing enormous outdoor parties in Maryland that drew the attention of local law enforcement. As Forcer's popularity grew, an old school bus is purchased from a church for $400, and they venture to record new, harder-edged music at Studio 4 in Philadelphia. Deciding the only way to get signed is to relocate to the West Coast, they leave for the Metal Mecca of the 80s-Hollywood, CA. However, the bus dies in West Virginia. It is abandoned and they commandeer a three-passenger rental box truck to drive the six of them the rest of the way to Hollywood.â€”Rudy Childs","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1985 Indestructible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25581830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
