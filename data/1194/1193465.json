Somewhere out there, on a distant Planet D? The film is composed of footage captured in a teenage prison camp, where the author led classes for inmates in 2018, as well as from family video chronicles made in the 1990s. Olesya Rudyka reflects: “When my dad was released from incarceration, we believed we had our whole life ahead of us.
