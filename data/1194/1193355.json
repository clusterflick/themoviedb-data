In Ukraine, everyday life flows like any other day. The first bombings arrive, forcing many to leave the country, others to take up arms, almost everyone to face separations, fears, the absence of basic necessities and bereavement. The film is the director's journey, driven by the need to get to the emotional epicentre of this conflict, which starts in Warsaw and travels through the cities of Lviv and Odessa and the forgotten countryside of Ukraine, to Kyiv, Irpin, Bucha, Borodyanka. She meets those who crossed the border to survive or help the resistance, or those who remained in their homeland continuing to fight to defend their country and their culture.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/nPABOB6zfjszdscgfxoIhX8FRci.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wartime Notes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Meleleo","original_name":"Barbara Meleleo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531111dc439c0011bdc30c0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2750044,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roberto Moliterni","original_name":"Roberto Moliterni","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/5VUcix3XSMZewzl8lDZfZfyVaCz.jpg","credit_id":"653111341108a8012ca4da97","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Cupisti","original_name":"Barbara Cupisti","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":"/kfodnfkiysQAYLiN6hiGnWPBsnF.jpg","credit_id":"653110fd7eb5f200ffea1438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288698,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandro Bartolozzi","original_name":"Sandro Bartolozzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531114851a64e012baa28ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2868369,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommaso Gimignani","original_name":"Tommaso Gimignani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65311183f1759c00e2f019f6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Cupisti","original_name":"Barbara Cupisti","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":"/kfodnfkiysQAYLiN6hiGnWPBsnF.jpg","credit_id":"6531110bc439c00138362718","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750050,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antonello Sarao","original_name":"Antonello Sarao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531117130f79c00ab7b8ce1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347287,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piero Lassandro","original_name":"Piero Lassandro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65311199aede5900c8b1e2b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Meleleo","original_name":"Barbara Meleleo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531115ff1759c01394b418d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29545146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/nPABOB6zfjszdscgfxoIhX8FRci.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EU-Asia Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visioni dal Mondo International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
