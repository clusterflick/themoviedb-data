Filmed across Wakefield, Halifax and Middlesbrough, the film brings together stories of loss, migration, friendship, and mutual aid, to convey a strong sense of place and lived experience. Exploring our relationship to the places we live and our sense of belonging, the film challenges stereotypes and gives a vital voice to those not often heard. From Where We Stand is a thoughtfully observed film that feels truly collaborative, and an authentic portrait of Northern England post-Brexit.","popularity":0.1109,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":211529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northern Exposure Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Where We Stand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4330608,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jake Bench","original_name":"Jake Bench","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532a114efe37c011e74497d","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4330605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Kaye","original_name":"Lucy Kaye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532a0c6b2681f00c44eca78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602303,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl Mainzer","original_name":"Karl Mainzer","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532a1089ac535087f3afca7","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4330606,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rodrigo Narváez","original_name":"Rodrigo Narváez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532a0d8efe37c0101394628","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4330605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Kaye","original_name":"Lucy Kaye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532a11eb2681f00ac488e47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4330607,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zelida Gordon","original_name":"Zelida Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532a0edb2681f00feb0ca36","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fkqt77uOxiv1Nwq6gmuL2D5lb2P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rLZpQCvwlKOSE0zumk9OnaN1Nzn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Leeds International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"From Where We Stand - Trailer","key":"831578947","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-30T16:44:44.000Z","id":"6532a0978d22fc00ea6d2313"}]}}}
