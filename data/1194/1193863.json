This time, portraying Plaza Sol in Madrid at two different times. Moving in one direction, I shoot three frames for each shot, leaving the next three frames unexposed. Weeks later, through the process of manually rewinding the reel, I take back the black frames and shoot them in the opposite direction. An attempt to create a tension between opposite directions, both of the camera and the filmed bodies.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2717272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Remy","original_name":"Nicole Remy","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6532bfe09ac5350877565507","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
