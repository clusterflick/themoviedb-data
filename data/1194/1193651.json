After decades in the Downtown art world, Penny’s personal relationships with dozens of outrageous characters, from the world famous to the fascinatingly obscure, led to the creation of the Lower East Side Biography Project, an oral history of New York’s Bohemian culture from the 1950s to the present. These half-hour biographies have broadcast weekly on Time Warner Manhattan Cable Television for 20 years. Beyond Queer is a feature documentary compiled from these television interviews.","popularity":0.2123,"poster_path":"/zzbKNZYyBAHF7etMRgCh1ODHq32.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Queer: Voices from Bohemia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quentin Crisp","original_name":"Quentin Crisp","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/9kp2xAPdUtZnmSTmpiNxoBQz5Tj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6aeb2681f00e13a7ed5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Mead","original_name":"Taylor Mead","popularity":0.3096,"profile_path":"/5UHc1T7cTParS6sfYKD3WBht2rW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6b76f8d9500ac5cc4d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Dodson","original_name":"Betty Dodson","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/sr76F74TMZkfKjZRJULyBcY4Emd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6bd6d9fe800c4a88daa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1478667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Waters","original_name":"Jack Waters","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/vDol3P9G8EM5I6s1C644CaecE5i.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6d7efe37c00c7ebbd4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1478668,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Schulman","original_name":"Sarah Schulman","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/9aJAOO9XJpb4LrgZBoW3f106XwJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6df48138200ac39f4f3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Woodlawn","original_name":"Holly Woodlawn","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/lAfx6cfa4q6Qdm3P2s52fqfhdQ6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6ed6f8d9500ea58ef91","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayne County","original_name":"Jayne County","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/9rN0p7wb7jiWrMtdZ1VTTVCnwGJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f6f3b2681f00feb076e0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4329633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Zehetner","original_name":"Steve Zehetner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531f677efe37c013b45b009","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Margarita Albelo","original_name":"Anna Margarita Albelo","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531f66b9ac53508752f1172","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":399007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Arcade","original_name":"Penny Arcade","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6531f65eb2681f00c44e773e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hEUGZwMFTyRqIFy0ppse4FaGiLM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zzbKNZYyBAHF7etMRgCh1ODHq32.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
