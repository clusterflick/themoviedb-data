Being rather popular in the Netherlands was obviously the reason to film and record their performance at De Boerderij in Zoetermeer on the 12th of April last year. The result is a release of a 2 disc CD/DVD digipack with a 24 page colour booklet. Strangely enough not any picture of this Dutch concert can be seen in the booklet. Instead there is artwork that very much goes in the line of designs on earlier releases. Every track is described in the liner notes and gives a bit of inside information what they are about. Those songs are taken from their albums Tick Tock (2009), Night (see review, 2007/2012), Missa Atropos (2010), Firebird (2005), March Of Ghosts (2012) and of course Demon.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t8yNg7sKExoC2Mp5ibiKaKy8IyR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gazpacho - Night of The Demon","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1085,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t8yNg7sKExoC2Mp5ibiKaKy8IyR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
