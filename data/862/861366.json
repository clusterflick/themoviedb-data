A new setting for the filmmaker but the same sun-drenched blue sky and sea. Like all of Lertxundi’s work, Inner Outer Space is a film about relationships – between characters, between characters and landscape, between image and sound – but also, and ultimately, a deconstruction of the production process that highlights materiality and artifice. Just like the blindfolded woman in the film who attempts to orientate herself in a new geography, Lertxundi is learning – through the making of a film – to reacquaint herself with the landscape of her native Basque Country. The concluding chapter – in which two young women perform a mysterious choreography to the projected images of waves – is an outburst of pure feeling.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dl1Ud1t8hRn9e9mZoCeBy5Ukf87.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inner Outer Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1277877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laida Lertxundi","original_name":"Laida Lertxundi","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/3nqL2n1eafr52XDWscttDAJnyKr.jpg","credit_id":"611840a89a9e200045f88410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15210646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dl1Ud1t8hRn9e9mZoCeBy5Ukf87.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Sebastián Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
