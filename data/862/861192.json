Women journalists from several parts of Mexico who cover the beat of hard news, reveal the challenges they face when doing their work with various actors: their sources, law enforcement officers, drug trafficking and the state. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in which to practice journalism. Several reporters have been assassinated since 2000. Within this context, female journalists face a double challenge: firstly, to work in a country with a high level of anti-press, violence, and, secondly, the state and situation of their gender in a country riddled with femicide.","popularity":0.1704,"poster_path":"/buB6B0jtPCkdvd1GoENPfSN2FQv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Will Not Silence Our Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3197278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yennué Zárate Valderrama","original_name":"Yennué Zárate Valderrama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61175cea350398002db8af1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel J.
