She's the life of the party, infamous for her annual birthday camping trip where she sets up a scavenger hunt with gifts for each of her best friends to discover.  But this summer is different. When Lola's life is cut short by a tragic overdose, the group is left to grapple with the painful loss, questioning whether they should return to their hallowed campsite without her. Their answer comes when they discover that Lola had set up her annual scavenger hunt just weeks before her untimely death. Their final gifts are waiting in the woodsâ€¦along with a shocking secret that threatens to tear them all apart.","popularity":0.3215,"poster_path":"/qmjZhP7qOO0YVQPKHFOhmSzStgL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49937,"logo_path":"/j14jwTsJj6ok9IkUFewX7acufKu.png","name":"Good Deed Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's Never Too Late To Say Goodbye.","title":"Always, Lola","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2350471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxy Striar","original_name":"Roxy Striar","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/mWZaIKs4K4t1c0ojNTTtBqKAuzj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lola","credit_id":"6119a5542e0697002e47d655","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Ghai","original_name":"Andrew Ghai","popularity":0.1674,"profile_path":"/jIzm5OMok5vrrjsoLYLvYaoPQ8k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lee","credit_id":"6119a5622dc44e005c5f2ad7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheldon White","original_name":"Sheldon White","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/zC8HbQvteWnWPwlRpRUB6c54oKR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Riggs","credit_id":"6119a57da0b6b5002c8ce738","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candice Cruz","original_name":"Candice Cruz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Camila","credit_id":"6119a59ee54d5d005d8e156c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corrinne Mica","original_name":"Corrinne Mica","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Katherine","credit_id":"6119a5af7ef3810072f338a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Collin Campana","original_name":"Collin Campana","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Trey","credit_id":"6119a5bb66540800473d40aa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2030356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajiim A.
