Images of hair braided in dreadlocks, a ritual mask drowning in the sunlight, and a smoking cigarette become companions on her journey through the labyrinths of mind. Sensory Overload blurs the concepts of space, time, and form with the help of Natacha Muzira’s poem about the liberating power of imagination, voiced off-screen. In Rwanda, a country with a developed oral culture, it is the word that becomes the catalyst for unlocking the potential of cinematic tropes.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/sqXghbWWKfdrSsid2HC9GRma6m4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kiruri Mfn","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"}],"release_date":"2020-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensory Overload","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ganza Moise","original_name":"Ganza Moise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611a316c387651002e715815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqXghbWWKfdrSsid2HC9GRma6m4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
