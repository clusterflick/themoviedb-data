He explores how variations in people's appearances come to be mistaken for essential differences. He traces how these misinterpretations function both to express and to reproduce dominant power relations. And he argues for more rigorous engagements with identity, representation, and contingency capable of acknowledging and respecting difference without essentializing it. An ideal introduction to how cultural studies intervenes in debates about race, representation, identity, and power.","popularity":0.1353,"poster_path":"/3c0ZjV5ckqEkTu5r6dP1KQ73cc2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stuart Hall: Race, The Floating Signifier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Hall","original_name":"Stuart Hall","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/7oh4Fm32o7ZgyCghSFArZuXSx4X.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"61195cd87ef381002bed0c2a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"631906ce8ddc340098f7241b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3664452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3c0ZjV5ckqEkTu5r6dP1KQ73cc2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
