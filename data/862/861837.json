The trilogy addresses the layered dimensions of our world, from the microscopic, to the human, to the macroscopic. Through Ikeda’s process, massive scientific data sets have been transcribed, converted, transformed, de/re/meta-constructed and orchestrated to visualise and sonify the different dimensions that co-exist in our world between the visible and the invisible. Each variation immerses visitors in the vast data universe in which we live, capturing hidden facets of nature and the vast scientific knowledge underpinning our existence. This large-scale data-driven trilogy is generated by extremely precise computer programming and features a minimalist electronic soundtrack, harmonised with Hollywood-standard, high-definition, 4K DCI video projections of scientific data onto a large screen.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/saiCwn9dlQCiu9foCATQbOkDZHm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"data-verse 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryoji Ikeda","original_name":"Ryoji Ikeda","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/mxFltlzrKBYPh5P7Cf67QPpq3ot.jpg","credit_id":"611a49cdc14fee007dcfa3aa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryoji Ikeda","original_name":"Ryoji Ikeda","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/mxFltlzrKBYPh5P7Cf67QPpq3ot.jpg","credit_id":"611a49d5c14fee002567c65a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryoji Ikeda","original_name":"Ryoji Ikeda","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/mxFltlzrKBYPh5P7Cf67QPpq3ot.jpg","credit_id":"611a49df6c19ea00464b4ede","department":"Art","job":"Concept Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norimichi Hirakawa","original_name":"Norimichi Hirakawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611a49f387f3f200454beb08","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199438,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tomonaga Tokuyama","original_name":"Tomonaga Tokuyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611a4a009a9e200028f6da77","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2863392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Satoshi Hamaoka","original_name":"Satoshi Hamaoka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611a4a0d1bf876007f314608","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199441,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ryo Shiraki","original_name":"Ryo Shiraki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611a4a186840cc00743e9bf0","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/saiCwn9dlQCiu9foCATQbOkDZHm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
