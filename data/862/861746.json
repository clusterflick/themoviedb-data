Teav give offerings to Tum and he proudly accepts the offers, despite Cambodian tradition forbidding a young female from engaging in any close activity with a monk (so giving offerings is not allowed). As the story progress, the relationship of Tum and Teav deepens. Teav's mother is unaware of the relationship between the monk she respects and her 16-year-old daughter. No, Teav's friendly assistant, helps conceal the relationship of Tum and Teav from Teav's mother. As soon as Teav's mother finds out that Tum is in love with her daughter, she forbids her daughter from ever seeing him again. The story ends in a dramatic tragedy when Tum is killed and Teav commits suicide.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teav Aek","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sek Bothoum","original_name":"Sek Bothoum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6119dc1a6840cc005c065f04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3021580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vichara Dany","original_name":"Vichara Dany","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/j6EiXCVrEe6sAxhDtJltzITxULx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Teav","credit_id":"6119dc34151c5c005c6e824d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Som Eun","original_name":"Kong Som Eun","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/w82kCecltf6vHFy17OZQszW5Ndu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tum","credit_id":"6119dc49c14fee005dc06bbd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nop Nem","original_name":"Nop Nem","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6119dc6a2dc44e007e4804ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Or Dom","original_name":"Or Dom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6119dc7a87f3f20075668d28","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Biv Chai Leang","original_name":"Biv Chai Leang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6119dc06e54d5d0046ca408c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14564008","wikidata_id":"Q7691995","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"km","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
