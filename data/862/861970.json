White mercenaries with war experience are also involved in the conflicts. They include Germans who, under the leadership of the former Wehrmacht officer Siegfried Müller, brutally attack the black population. After the \"Stern\" reporter Gerd Heidemann had uncovered the machinations, the GDR filmmaker Walter Heynowski made a politically motivated documentary about Siegfried \"Kongo Müller\". Now Siegfried Ressel has reconstructed the story of the German mercenaries and the propaganda argument about their use.","popularity":0.125,"poster_path":"/azqwESLVvi0FbCVMQWEvXAbxrif.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159162,"logo_path":null,"name":"a+r film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kongo-Müller: A German-German story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Müller","original_name":"Siegfried Müller","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"611aa7860f0da5005f54502e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siegfried Ressel","original_name":"Siegfried Ressel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa7ad87f3f2002c3281de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287532,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sebastian Hattop","original_name":"Sebastian Hattop","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/xPMfdQY8pTnVU53wQeCEFsdJ8R3.jpg","credit_id":"611aa7cb1bf876007f31d410","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199954,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fayd Jungnickel","original_name":"Fayd Jungnickel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa7e51bf876007f31d456","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199955,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Köppen","original_name":"Andreas Köppen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa7f34a0b19002e83a989","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199956,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tobias Gaugenrieder","original_name":"Tobias Gaugenrieder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa8004a0b190045c4220d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122133,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hannes Richter","original_name":"Hannes Richter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa8122dc44e002c41c347","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2271499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emma Gräf","original_name":"Emma Gräf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa81c9f0e19007339b783","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2052312,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martin Pieper","original_name":"Martin Pieper","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611aa8399a9e200028f7940d","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1154,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/azqwESLVvi0FbCVMQWEvXAbxrif.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":769}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
