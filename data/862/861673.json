In their explorations, Khadijah disclosed that one of the places they feel most comfortable and themself is out in nature. This caused Diansangu think about how Black people do not really fit into people's perception of nature lovers, which creates a kind of tension between \"nature\" (whatever that concept actually means) and Blackness.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/j0h4JSehaGfG2NRBUTfsHRvGbU6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"black queer nature poem for khadijah (and all of us)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khadijah Salihu","original_name":"Khadijah Salihu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6119909b514c4a004647691c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mae Diansangu","original_name":"Mae Diansangu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"611990c89a9e200045fbc58b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mae Diansangu","original_name":"Mae Diansangu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611990b32dc44e007e4711ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736982,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tao-Anas Le Thanh","original_name":"Tao-Anas Le Thanh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611990db1bf876002f8e5c90","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mae Diansangu","original_name":"Mae Diansangu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611990bf9f0e190028d551e7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mae Diansangu","original_name":"Mae Diansangu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61590096c8a2d40043be347a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0h4JSehaGfG2NRBUTfsHRvGbU6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
