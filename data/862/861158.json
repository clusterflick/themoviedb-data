After stumbling upon a crime scene, a young woman is kidnapped and locked in a basement in this psychological thriller that is reminiscent of ROOM. While her kidnappers figure out whether she should live or die, she must use her cunning to play them off each other if she has any hope of escaping. However, being locked in a room all alone turns out to be more than she bargained for. And maybe her biggest threat isn't the kidnappers. Maybe it's herself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's no escape","title":"The Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
