Addressing codes of hip-hop culture, Ridnyi borrows the popular form of a rap battle to collide two great works of world literature associated with this historical figure: Mazeppa by Lord Byron in 1819 and Poltava by Alexander Pushkin in 1828–29. While Byron envisions Mazepa as a romantic hero, seized by love, Pushkin portrays him as a traitor in accordance with the colonial attitude of the Russian Empire. Highlighting the confrontation of these two texts, Ridnyi invited four rappers from different national and cultural backgrounds to write and perform their response to the poets’ lyrics.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/fcZYGjDI5KizqtnzbCzILoqPXxP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle Over Mazepa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5108890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Philpott","original_name":"Eleanor Philpott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"675729d4ce47f209005162d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5108893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moh Alghanem Salih","original_name":"Moh Alghanem Salih","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"675729e9997d956422f466e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5108896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassianne Lawrence","original_name":"Cassianne Lawrence","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"675729fb997d956422f466f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5108898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Exo","original_name":"Exo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67572a0798c33892a2559de1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6757295dce47f2090051627a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5108908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mats Meisen","original_name":"Mats Meisen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67572a409cc0b6fc319a79f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fcZYGjDI5KizqtnzbCzILoqPXxP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
