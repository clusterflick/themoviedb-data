The short (which was in production for a few years) is experimental in the sense that it doesn't have a cohesive story, with it being made using footage that Stephen recorded of people walking in Hollywood Boulevard from 2007-2010, and animating them in walk cycles, with some additional shots being hand painted. In an episode of the Big Pop Fun podcast, Stephen mentions that the short is also set to music, which is \"Chocochip\" by Money Mark.","popularity":0.132,"poster_path":"/pqZ4hO9h616i94cqdMVihUAZuuT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8921,"logo_path":"/wZEtdueugvOSYwDD3gbFNHctVWY.png","name":"United Plankton Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Blvd, USA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Hillenburg","original_name":"Stephen Hillenburg","popularity":0.4991,"profile_path":"/vDTwuiqM6BR9xv3eNOCXbEZl1gg.jpg","credit_id":"6757ad4beedec22d8aebee5b","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Hillenburg","original_name":"Stephen Hillenburg","popularity":0.4991,"profile_path":"/vDTwuiqM6BR9xv3eNOCXbEZl1gg.jpg","credit_id":"6757ad55eedec22d8aebee5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Hillenburg","original_name":"Stephen Hillenburg","popularity":0.4991,"profile_path":"/vDTwuiqM6BR9xv3eNOCXbEZl1gg.jpg","credit_id":"6757ad67eedec22d8aebee63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Money Mark","original_name":"Money Mark","popularity":0.1846,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67581a073509719dd14775fe","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995355,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ernest Chan","original_name":"Ernest Chan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67581a1e8138be55d9a1434f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Hillenburg","original_name":"Stephen Hillenburg","popularity":0.4991,"profile_path":"/vDTwuiqM6BR9xv3eNOCXbEZl1gg.jpg","credit_id":"67581a2beedec22d8aec046c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411034,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Juan Camilo Gonzales","original_name":"Juan Camilo Gonzales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67581a47e528400caac1b216","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5110388,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Hink","original_name":"Chris Hink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67581a5b0ab7e8077cfc05c7","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3874552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8F17oM22JeJRzzA2PTaKa14kywG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pqZ4hO9h616i94cqdMVihUAZuuT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Holland Animation Film Festival","release_date":"2014-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
