Fatigued, but with the same tenacity he roams the roads, the pathways, the tracks every day, medical bag in hand. Everyone awaits him: desperate or in hope, to the dying or to the woman in labour. He is the local GP. In fact, he is film director Imre Gyöngyössy’s father, the protagonist of one of his first short films. The personal narration based on the director’s poem is made complete by the pictures of Sándor Sára and István Gaál who were also active at Balázs Béla Studio at that time.","popularity":0.5276,"poster_path":"/rLokKhHiddQacqza8dVFTq1ONVM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22943,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Béla Balazs","origin_country":""},{"id":40353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balázs Béla Stúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1967-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Férfiarckép","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1259960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"István Sztankay","original_name":"István Sztankay","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/su3N5YK84NTukPHW1E0dR2yBl9e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67564a9feafc4a14955b8a1a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Imre Gyöngyössy","original_name":"Imre Gyöngyössy","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/m0N8lnMSiPw7QBSFBm7eguvOgXR.jpg","credit_id":"6756269c0564b1ea9b6ed7cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Gaál","original_name":"István Gaál","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/mCzxVc9kWewbaGkmkX0MaKGV82h.jpg","credit_id":"675649690564b1ea9b6edc0c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937376,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sándor Sára","original_name":"Sándor Sára","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/jAodQac89UjwNH4bvaHz8lRoYSa.jpg","credit_id":"675649760564b1ea9b6edc12","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Imre Gyöngyössy","original_name":"Imre Gyöngyössy","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/m0N8lnMSiPw7QBSFBm7eguvOgXR.jpg","credit_id":"675649830564b1ea9b6edc1d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Gaál","original_name":"István Gaál","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/mCzxVc9kWewbaGkmkX0MaKGV82h.jpg","credit_id":"67564a6beafc4a14955b8a05","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0154520","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rLokKhHiddQacqza8dVFTq1ONVM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":211715,"name":"country doctor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"1967-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
