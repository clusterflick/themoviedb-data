That is why we are here! Skizkatonic University is dedicated to educating the world on strange phenomena and creatures such as this.  In this volume of our program, we encounter the mystery of an ancient and ferocious creature known only as \"The Beast\" or the \"Sherrie\". Join us as we inform you the backstory, legend and even the more recent goings on involving this deadly mega-hound of mysterious destruction.  In addition to Dr Hubert Smank's hosting and narration, we will also be joined by an expert on the case: Professor P.U. Hearty-Garden. The Professor has been knee deep in the supernatural since the unfortunate passing of his first Wife Dorothy who inspired him to find what people would call \"the illogical solution\".  We hope you enjoy this program and show interest in our future educational releases.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"A Skizkatonic Educational Release","title":"The Beast of Shirtlington","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
