Even by Bob’s own admission, his unsettled and at sometimes chaotic upbringing, combined with the loss of his father, left him with some undefinable character deficiencies, creating a lifelong obsession for travel, sailing and adventure, which he has pursued relentlessly for the last six decades. The film explores where Bob’s drive to go on expeditions comes from, and why he has been willing to forego a stable home life and financial security in order to pursue difficult and often unattainable objectives.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dark Sky Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell to Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5107708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Shepton","original_name":"Bob Shepton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"As Self","credit_id":"6756643e187d27b266a3dbaa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5107705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Prescott","original_name":"Chris Prescott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675663b09e12fa25e8fbcf7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22766702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
