One day, as he crosses the street, a pedestrian bumps into him abruptly, causing him to lose his headphones. Ernesto is surprised when he begins to hear and perceive the world he had ignored so many times. Ernesto discovers that at the intersection of this busy street, tiny stories coincide, which have as a common element the space and the time it takes to reach the other end of the street.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viandantes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1864415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Martín","original_name":"Willy Martín","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/cAcc5UWEBnJHs0TjqnNmT9xrA00.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67562e280982b462678a1a9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nacho Huett","original_name":"Nacho Huett","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/2viQ48QKP7RJpxvvPzX2CD08hv0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67562e42d428ca1c5d62ebd7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5044711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerardo Soto","original_name":"Gerardo Soto","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67562e5e66c89f44182c0faa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5107505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Viloria Diaz","original_name":"Eduardo Viloria Diaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67562e800982b462678a1aeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5107505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Viloria Diaz","original_name":"Eduardo Viloria Diaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67562ea766c89f44182c0fc8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2124082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
