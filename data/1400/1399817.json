The two hour-long specials were filmed as part of Gaffigan's The Pale Tourist worldwide tour, in which he traveled the world--in each country meeting people, eating the food, and learning a bit about the history. He would then transform those experiences into a stand-up set of all-new material and perform it for locals and expatriates, before heading on to another destination and doing it all over again. The first Episode is titled Canadian American and features Jim performing in Canada on tour.","popularity":0.4312,"poster_path":"/dugRw3F8zzQCuf6o2iNnnXwpN9N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20580,"logo_path":"/oRR9EXVoKP9szDkVKlze5HVJS7g.png","name":"Amazon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jim Gaffigan: The Pale Tourist 1 - Canadian American","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Gaffigan","original_name":"Jim Gaffigan","popularity":0.7508,"profile_path":"/dhguhHxIrb26jvPznBt8y25Fb2U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67574330d7b16434a89f79c0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Gaffigan","original_name":"Jim Gaffigan","popularity":0.7508,"profile_path":"/dhguhHxIrb26jvPznBt8y25Fb2U.jpg","credit_id":"675742e95605e0d01c63f5ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Gaffigan","original_name":"Jim Gaffigan","popularity":0.7508,"profile_path":"/dhguhHxIrb26jvPznBt8y25Fb2U.jpg","credit_id":"67574387d7b16434a89f79dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12764122","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e9hds0tnjRejZZlI5rGNSYf6Mol.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dugRw3F8zzQCuf6o2iNnnXwpN9N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PALE TOURIST Trailer JULY 24th only on Amazon Prime Video","key":"kTioVrOFfVQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-07T17:00:11.000Z","id":"67574360ce47f209005167b5"}]}}}
