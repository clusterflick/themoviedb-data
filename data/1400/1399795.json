This sequence of short poems, separated by black, follows the contour of one day in HA. Featured are the Grateful Dead at home, Oracle newspaper office, Diggers' Free Food in the Park, the Free Frame of Reference, and many friends. Like BE-IN, performed on the homemade optical printer. Too visually intricate for sound, this oneâ€™s all for your eyes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tribal Home Movie #2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loren Sears","original_name":"Loren Sears","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67573703431108aa23d13bdc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
