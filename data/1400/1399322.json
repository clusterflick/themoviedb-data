Pat and Patachon also leave the stifling streets behind to spend the summer in the countryside. Armed with a homemade camera, they hope to earn a living by taking photographs, though their efforts are not particularly successful. By chance, they come across an inn owned by the formidable Mother Hulda. She quickly sniffs out their attempt to make their escape without paying their bill, and while Patachon is forced to stay as collateral, Pat sets off to make some money. He becomes the subject of many unpleasant mishaps along the way, while Patachon is coerced into becoming engaged to Hulda and gets entangled in a conflict between Hulda, her daughter Grethe, and Grethe’s boyfriend Erik.
