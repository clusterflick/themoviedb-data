After a brief sojourn in New York, she lived alone in a one-room cabin for much of her adult life, often walking several miles into nearby Fort Atkinson to work as a copy editor at a dairy industry trade journal until failing eyesight reduced her to menial labour. Niedecker connected to the outside world by post, and among the small shelf of books she kept for herself in later years were several collections of letters, including those of the composer Franz Liszt and his lover, the scholar Marie Catherine Sophie, Comtesse dâ€™Agoult.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/oXsPEkMO9fBsQ4srV3D23cEiCJR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter from Blackhawk Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Jenkins","original_name":"Derek Jenkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67574bce66c89f44182c2a2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oXsPEkMO9fBsQ4srV3D23cEiCJR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Media City Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
