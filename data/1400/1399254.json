The film is structured through the father-daughter dialogue written by Cosașu to lend colour and a narrative to the aforementioned exhibition. The style of his writing combines the wit, irony, and casual tone that have become his trademark: here, however, these qualities are put to work for the benefit of the socialist state’s political agenda.","popularity":0.1024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":204889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sahia Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Ones Describe the Big World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Barta","original_name":"Gabriel Barta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559ede1e194ed6bf33b1da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Radu Cosașu","original_name":"Radu Cosașu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559efd6e0bed266b7f7e3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4451108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florea Marin","original_name":"Florea Marin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559f556e0bed266b7f7e66","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123583,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tiberiu Olasz","original_name":"Tiberiu Olasz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559f776e0bed266b7f7e7e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5106255,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George Preda","original_name":"George Preda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559f8aa18cb8695afd6c46","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061278,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mihai Viișoreanu","original_name":"Mihai Viișoreanu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559f9c66c89f44182bf839","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5106257,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aurel Misca","original_name":"Aurel Misca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67559fb06f37f6e89adc55e5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0172224","wikidata_id":"Q29581100","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
