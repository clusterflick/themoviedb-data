RE/creative follows six specialists from different fields who utilize re-creative practice in their work — an alternative approach to technological progress applying knowledge from the past to influence the future.  From art to forensic science, each field employs re-creative practice differently, but the fundamental concept of re-creating remains consistent across disciplines. This documentary explores the idea by examining each field’s connection to the need for more handmade and traditional methods of understanding.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iZVpgEa1BYpGDeQWEjly2Samhjc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RE/Creative: Learn From the Past; Influence the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5106557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikodem Trzcinowicz","original_name":"Nikodem Trzcinowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6755c7f7d428ca1c5d62e35b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5106557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikodem Trzcinowicz","original_name":"Nikodem Trzcinowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6755c8041e194ed6bf33b8f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5106558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary O'Neill","original_name":"Mary O'Neill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6755c86e1e194ed6bf33b949","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZVpgEa1BYpGDeQWEjly2Samhjc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
