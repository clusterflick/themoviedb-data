When they are about to be arrested because noise is not tolerated on the streets, a young solicitor helps them out of trouble and subsequently finds them jobs with an elderly laundrywoman. The town’s wealthy men are content with their quiet community and refuse to listen to the solicitor’s proposals for improvements and new initiatives to help everyone make money. However, with the help of Pat and Patachon, the solicitor cleverly persuades the men to change their minds. Soon, life flourishes in the little town, and Pat and Patachon are celebrated as its saviours.
