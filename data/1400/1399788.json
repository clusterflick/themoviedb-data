Employing a deliberately didactic approach, Cokes challenges the Bush administration’s policies and the war in Iraq. Statements on the Iraq war and Bush’s “war on terror” by Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, and Richard Clarke, among others, are displayed as on-screen text against flat bands of colour. The graphic presentation and accompanying pop soundtrack suggest the strategies of commercial advertising.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5M9CcvlcgI1nT8seCyT367rpwPG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evil.5: Grin and Bear (No Responsibility Mix)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Cokes","original_name":"Tony Cokes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675734249bc20eaa496813f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5M9CcvlcgI1nT8seCyT367rpwPG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
