However, the general refuses to give his only daughter to a man without fortune. Heartbroken, Anna confides in the duchess, who agrees to deliver a letter to Cernieff. The duke sees this, and when he intercepts the unsigned love declaration, he mistakenly believes that his wife is having an affair with the young lieutenant. Cernieff is thrown into a dungeon and sentenced to death.  The beginning of the film is missing. The first scene of the preserved fragment is the one in which Anna confides in the duchess.
