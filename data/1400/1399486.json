The films have been carefully selected from some of the world's major archives and then digitally scanned, restored and, in some cases, reconstructed in order to provide as complete a viewing experience as possible. With newly composed scores and a ton of EXTRAS on both discs, we trust you will be thoroughly entertained by Billy, and the rest of the mad world of Mack Sennett.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Bevan Silent Comedian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
