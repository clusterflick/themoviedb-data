In 1974, filmmaker Ian Dunlop visited Yayayi, a remote community in Central Australia. The Pintupi people had recently moved there to get away from the difficulties of living at the larger permanent government settlement of Papunya. Dunlop had come to Yayayi to follow up on the lives of people he had photographed ten years earlier as they were leaving their Western Desert homeland for the first time. He never made a film with the material he shot there and Yayayi has long since been abandoned.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering Yayayi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5109034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Myers","original_name":"Fred Myers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67573320f31dc8ce88fda32c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5109028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pip Deveson","original_name":"Pip Deveson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675732ee9bc20eaa49681321","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
