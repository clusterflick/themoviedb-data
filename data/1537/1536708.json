Our aim is to shed light on what really happened in Gdeim Izik during the autumn of 2010. The documentary is homage to the courage and strength of the Sahrawi people in their historic and unprecedented action, and it seeks recognition of their role in setting off the revolutions in the Arab world. Its aim is also to report and denounce the hypocritical role of foreign governments, the Moroccan government’s concealment of facts, and the way the Spanish government has been complicit in the situation through its policy of non-intervention in a conflict in which it is unavoidably involved.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/wmrxd0j3moSeIYCmZg8kQq1s0qc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sahara Thawra","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gdeim Izik: catalyst of the Arab Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":986,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/wmrxd0j3moSeIYCmZg8kQq1s0qc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":657}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
