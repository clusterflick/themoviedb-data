Bee-Kept is a documentary that feels like a visit to a secret apiary, or a conversation with a beekeeper-joyful, rambling, inspiring and packed full of information (and opinions!) about honeybees. Narrated by Alison Spittle. Ask four beekeepers a question, get five different answers-or so any beekeeper will tell you. Beekeepers are a curious species, and just like the bees they keep, the group is often more mysterious than the individual.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bee-Kept","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12398972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
