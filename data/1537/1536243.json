The history of Western Sahara, the area south of Morocco with an as yet undefined political status, is marked by a dark sequence of human rights violations. And it’s still forgotten. The documentary tells the story of Sahrawi people through the voices of special women who’ve been victims of violence, both in Western Sahara and in the refugee camps in Algeria. Through their testimonies, diaries and old photographs, the movie reconstructs the history of Western Sahara from a female and intimate point of view.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/k1ATPxHejV6USOyXgUf96tdR47d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272317,"logo_path":null,"name":"zona.org","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just to let you know that I'm alive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simona Ghizzoni","original_name":"Simona Ghizzoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ade54b699dfb93e0fa8dcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuela Zuccalà","original_name":"Emanuela Zuccalà","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ade5534d7780fe63624548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k1ATPxHejV6USOyXgUf96tdR47d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":715}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"},{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
