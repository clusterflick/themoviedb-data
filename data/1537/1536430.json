Living a life of exile in Berlin,he drifts through the city, chasing closeness and solitude. He works day and night in two different jobs: as a caregiver for an old man and at a truck wash station. He invents stories to fill the void. His only relationship is an affair with Andr√©, a man he meets for sex at night in a park. A fleeting visit from his cousin Maneli, whom he barely knows, gently disrupts Iman's routine. Their shared heritage of culture and pain lingers in the background. They talk, go to the pool, and fall asleep in a patch of forest. On his endless paths through the city, fragments from the lives of other passers-by drift alongside him. His search begins to connect with the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lovers Sleep Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3309390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Massih Parsaei","original_name":"Massih Parsaei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ae3472ce7d810a830f8779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
