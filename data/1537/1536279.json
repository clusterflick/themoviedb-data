Through the story of Pedro, we follow a struggling actor and immigrant who works as a delivery driver to get by. When an unexpected encounter challenges him to confront the compromises he's made in pursuit of success, his mindset shifts. As he begins to reclaim his boundaries and rediscover his voice, both on and off the stage, Pedro embarks on a quiet but powerful journey toward self-acceptance and authenticity. Inspired by filmmaker Victor Brasil Salgado's own path, Delivery explores dignity, resilience, and the courage it takes to live truthfully.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I bought this shirt with tips instead of eating.","title":"Delivery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
