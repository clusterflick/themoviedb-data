This tenuous, nation-building ribbon of steel was built through high, snowy, and unpredictable mountains. The tragic avalanche that occurred at the Rogers Pass summit in March of 1910 remains Canada's deadliest. 58 railway workers, majority Japanese died while attempting to clear a snow slide from the tracks when another larger avalanche struck from the other side in the middle of the dark night. This documentary project also delves into the lives of two unlikely friends today, a downtown Vancouver businessman, and a Japanese-born ski guide brought together by their need for purpose, healing, and a shared passion for researching the mysteries and injustices of this event. During production, the team was surprised with a visit by a 1910 victim’s great grandson from Tokyo.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/2oeq0xPmGZgp1p56wf8S4MOJ8vP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1910: The Uncovering","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5653684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoaki Fujimura","original_name":"Tomoaki Fujimura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68af552594ffc8fda50f8c8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5653686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Brewster","original_name":"Morgan Brewster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68af553b2bbccbd4a7b373ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5653689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherry Yano","original_name":"Sherry Yano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68af554b08850157ddb37449","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5233195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Townsend","original_name":"Chad Townsend","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af53f614a1b55e653d8cd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5233198,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Owen Akira Kato","original_name":"Owen Akira Kato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af543114a1b55e653d8cd7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5653665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dale Nichols","original_name":"Dale Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af546aa1fdb37c170f8d9b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5653665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dale Nichols","original_name":"Dale Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af549e2bfc935d393d8cb1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tavi Parusel","original_name":"Tavi Parusel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af54dac162f708ac390984","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229987,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cliff Hokanson","original_name":"Cliff Hokanson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af54f81187ec338a3d8cf7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":775,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2oeq0xPmGZgp1p56wf8S4MOJ8vP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":517}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10617,"name":"disaster"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"},{"id":162327,"name":"avalanche"},{"id":207684,"name":"canadian history"},{"id":299404,"name":"mountain documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
