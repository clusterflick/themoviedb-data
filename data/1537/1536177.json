Ольга Мичи","overview":"A film about the incredible and eventful creative path of photographer and artist Olga Michi, as well as about the art group \"GROM\" that she created. Olga Michi visited the most remote corners of the world, constantly testing her strength: she lived with African tribes, looked for cities lost in the South American jungle, photographed white sharks and swam in a river teeming with crocodiles. But at some point, she felt cramped within the framework of reportage photography, she wanted not only to reflect the world around her - she wanted to create her own.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/raofjoW2Bt8roKLKU3bJqifGzOq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Художественная одиссея.
