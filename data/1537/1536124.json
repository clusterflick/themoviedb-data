Despite being the major headliner through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties, Collingwood had not tasted the ultimate success since 1958.  The Road to Victory has been tough and laced with emotion and ridicule... for 32 years. In 1990 however, the hoodoo was finally broken.  The Road to Victory follows the build up throughout the season, and the ultimate success and scenes of unbridled joy as the most loved and hated football club took the grand prize at last.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5V3WQZhylKJKDGoUDI0EKXcnTFn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Football Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"32 years of heartbreak becomes a year of triumph","title":"The Road to Victory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie McGuire","original_name":"Eddie McGuire","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/f4d8KvyQ4ZaEGdFjOBxXbzhpU8g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68adb38bd058de29d5670c86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5644878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leigh Matthews","original_name":"Leigh Matthews","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hxrxufFX7nCZubOxhfHuJfX1wcZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68adb3e179e32ab66d9dbe15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5645062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Shaw","original_name":"Tony Shaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eZXTTF4TgWfiJPTVPtZxYG9ptzR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68adb3ea79e32ab66d9dbe19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5650525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darren Millane","original_name":"Darren Millane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68adb416d639264822782bc3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5645088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Daicos","original_name":"Peter Daicos","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68adb421c7e9a00b78782993","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie McGuire","original_name":"Eddie McGuire","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/f4d8KvyQ4ZaEGdFjOBxXbzhpU8g.jpg","credit_id":"68adb44db795627c92782c05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0776735","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n7qxmRwmIMHf6H4rGZR0LaYYgrW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5V3WQZhylKJKDGoUDI0EKXcnTFn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":255435,"name":"australian football league (afl)"},{"id":357669,"name":"collingwood"},{"id":357670,"name":"collingwood football club"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - Collingwood The Road To Victory (1991)","key":"KBjRkRTloLU","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-04T17:48:41.000Z","id":"68ae5193e8b9112a8f390303"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Road to Victory - Collingwood 1990 Season Highlights","key":"--9EMMEVFzw","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-17T08:51:33.000Z","id":"68adb368616c3d2ca86cf324"}]}}}
