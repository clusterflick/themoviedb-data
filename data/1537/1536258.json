In Palestine, a civilian population’s life passes in the shadow of a concrete wall eleven meters high. Beyond that wall, family, land, and jobs are left behind. In Western Sahara, in an attempt to create a safe zone, young women risk their lives removing landmines from the 3,000 kilometer strip of sand wall that separates them from their land and families. SEPARATED, through the voices of its protagonists, speaks of three peoples’ struggle to survive. Their common destiny unites them: exclusion and oblivion.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mDT4dHamlFkdjyPAqJrfu3tb3K2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Separated","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalie Halla","original_name":"Natalie Halla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adea672b697844a5fa8de0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mDT4dHamlFkdjyPAqJrfu3tb3K2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
