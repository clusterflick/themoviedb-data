It was continuously active for the full 12 hours of Nuit Blanche Toronto 2015. Using the movements of glaciers across the earth's surface as an entry point, this piece explores states of density, collaboration, collapse, overpopulation, relocation, disruption, environmental tipping points, mass graves, icebergs, and melting ice caps. Glaciology is a site specific performance that combines choreography with human sculpture and interactive technology. This creates a surreal, constantly shifting image of bodies as landscape and simultaneously as capsules of history and memory; both human and geological.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ip1tsRbDMSifmAms3kBv6pjl3w3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mighty Brave Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glaciology Being Inside the Glacier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1805889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandy Leary","original_name":"Brandy Leary","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/rlBeoIX1JmPep6Mku3M3hDTSE6S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68ade83dc542cb3916f38dc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3489155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Anita Wegner","original_name":"Lisa Anita Wegner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68ade84ad40a5578d44eb8b0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3489155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Anita Wegner","original_name":"Lisa Anita Wegner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ade8f2021e413f1f3d861e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5339170","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ip1tsRbDMSifmAms3kBv6pjl3w3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
