The times when the Sahrawi war of independence was on the international agenda seem to be long forgotten. The fate of hundreds of thousands Sahrawis living in refugee camps since the 1970s seems not to be spectacular enough for further attention. Inthe film the women get a chance to speak. It is a film about their experiences and hopes. It is mainly a film about life in surroundings where seemingly normal things are real challenges. The film is a simple and impressive portrait of women, who have been fighting against their fate to help their people. They have never lost their drive, no matter how unfavourable the circumstances have been. It reminds us of the fate of the Sahrawi people. The film is realistic, without any kitsch elements. It shows impressive pictures of the real lives of strong women, who have never stopped fighting for independence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ja1oPRQzNmfvqdvLkLNrcFu4aCW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produktion West","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The ladies of the desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1912035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Lackenberger","original_name":"Anita Lackenberger","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/z56AUQF98LTjgSyHHTggpNHxmBl.jpg","credit_id":"68aeeaa3f86ca016c1b36fbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3012234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerhard Mader","original_name":"Gerhard Mader","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aeeab2976049f3460f8a5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/ja1oPRQzNmfvqdvLkLNrcFu4aCW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":298721,"name":"women"},{"id":356810,"name":"sahrawi refugee camps"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
