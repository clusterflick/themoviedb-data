Bethe discusses the milestones of his career: his student work in Germany, his flight from the Nazis, his work on the Los Alamos Atomic Bomb project under Robert Oppenheimer, and his research on the energy production in stars. In working to help solve the energy crisis of the 1970’s, Bethe established himself as one of the country’s leading spokesmen for a safe way to use nuclear energy. Speaking in support of a sensible use, he represents a side of this controversial issue that deserves more attention. The film provides crucial insight into this complex issue by one of the world’s authorities.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5xJc3i74k0xXMhKB9lP7nFKT9WP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hans Bethe꞉ Prophet of Energy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Bethe","original_name":"Hans Bethe","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/ep6JIcQZxynbq9klZQXOBOSXEHP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68af76c1d645b17f6ff39541","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"68af76b27e996e4bc656ba27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1847607","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gRKbKxBNuQBOwajcVGQI7EPkUI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2160}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/miKvm56FY6vy62eqrf8M5VgQaim.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5xJc3i74k0xXMhKB9lP7nFKT9WP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rPqRvAVIpYK1d2BfuViygbnkX7x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":8012,"name":"physicist"},{"id":214731,"name":"atomic energy"},{"id":285777,"name":"manhattan project"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hans Bethe 2K Trailer V2 (w: watermark)","key":"334955915","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-21T17:09:05.000Z","id":"68af77b394ffc8fda50f8d26"}]}}}
