The film is set to Maronie Street, an instrumental piece by accordionist Marcato, selected by Aoyama from festival submissions. Through this music-driven framework, the film explores human fragility and resilience with minimalistic, poetic imagery, reflecting Aoyama’s interest in blending visual and musical storytelling.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DOWN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Aoyama","original_name":"青山真治","popularity":0.3337,"profile_path":"/x1s0DjsTFdu8l59eb8srzxuRpFS.jpg","credit_id":"68addb363fa381aca1449965","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5650852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"マルカート","original_name":"マルカート","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68addb602cf904ae89a9af17","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
