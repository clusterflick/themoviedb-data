The Sahrawi people are divided by a wall of more than 2000 km in length. This Moroccan wall is not only a defensive position for the occupying power, but it is also an obstacle for the cultural and social development of the original population, and also a wall of emotions and disappointments. The story of Ahmed Tarfi, despite being fictional, could very well be the story of thousands of young Sahrawis.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":203544,"logo_path":null,"name":"E.F.A Abidin Kaid Saleh","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A divided homeland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":293194,"name":"youth"},{"id":356810,"name":"sahrawi refugee camps"},{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
