Following Detective Goliath, the story begins in the neon-lit underworld of Denver before spiraling through portals, woods, alien starships, and the haunted dreamworld of Planet Sex. Along the way, he encounters cultists, fairies, demons, doubles, and a queen who births his clone. His pursuit of love with the mysterious Sally becomes inseparable from betrayal, violence, and illusion. As reality fractures, Goliath discovers that his life is a script authored by a godlike Director - culminating in a massacre and a cosmic revelation that collapses the boundary between cinema and existence.  A fever-dream mosaic of betrayal, passion, psychedelic visuals, and existential terror, STAR XYZ is designed to be a rare cinematic experience: haunting, hypnotic, and unforgettable.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vbRmSoPRLHW8dzGtriQsAIDcMB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257212,"logo_path":null,"name":"KILLING SILENCE PRODUCTIONS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"STAR XYZ","title":"STAR XYZ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Chapman","original_name":"Graham Chapman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Goliath","credit_id":"68adf982a17bf49ee2fa8e07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5651096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarett Gage","original_name":"Jarett Gage","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Magician","credit_id":"68adf9bf8f7c185c7ef38de6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5651102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Bridenbaugh","original_name":"Olivia Bridenbaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sally, Selena, The Assistant","credit_id":"68adfa2ee74c81dee9b36c8e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"dAUVIon Trowell","original_name":"dAUVIon Trowell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf7e6b763b169df39021d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"dAUVIon Trowell","original_name":"dAUVIon Trowell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf80301ec399c9c39018c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"dAUVIon Trowell","original_name":"dAUVIon Trowell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf81014a92b1f7c62459f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5651090,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ethan Kelly","original_name":"Ethan Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf822777fc5504056b385","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"dAUVIon Trowell","original_name":"dAUVIon Trowell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf838bb7e4a9532b36ce5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5651091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larue Trowell","original_name":"Larue Trowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf855df425abfc10f86be","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5065803,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Gurzhiev","original_name":"Michael Gurzhiev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf94439352f6a56624572","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"dAUVIon Trowell","original_name":"dAUVIon Trowell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adf95e589a21e0ff56b3a3","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuel Andrade","original_name":"Emanuel Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adfac45fd3bfa65f3d8675","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuel Andrade","original_name":"Emanuel Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adfaeb8f7c185c7ef38df0","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuel Andrade","original_name":"Emanuel Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adfb02e74c81dee9b36c9c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Effects Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuel Andrade","original_name":"Emanuel Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68adfb1456fb7e3c0b0f8697","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vbRmSoPRLHW8dzGtriQsAIDcMB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
