Duchamp didn’t allow the piece to be viewed by the public until after his death in 1968. This left him shielded from the questions that developed after the piece debuted. Simply described, it is a peepshow. Through an old wooden façade, one looks through to see a sculpted open-legged nude lying in a field. The critics were stumped. What did Duchamp leave us with? This BBC documentary from 1997 dissects and examines the pieces of this assemblage.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/67tre6feH1N3QYaWQytE0KmNKOD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret of Marcel Duchamp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Secret Life of Marcel Duchamp","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Duchamp","original_name":"Marcel Duchamp","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"68af33574d7780fe63624c0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hamilton","original_name":"Richard Hamilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kYV4nwVxjCAbOAZUmXoMJW62gpC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"68af339790b06db1e3b3715a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Granlund","original_name":"Chris Granlund","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af33b2fb80eca730624c62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0939551","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rKp32QMnt63jl9fTXyoKEmtPuy8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/urTvYvNG8ycO7I2yeDflcr0nVkF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67tre6feH1N3QYaWQytE0KmNKOD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
