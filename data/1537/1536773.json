PHANTASMATAPES is a psychotronic VHS mixtape that reimagines THE REVENGE OF DR. X (a Japan-set creature feature that was written by Ed Wood) and THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE (the savage body horror film that inspired FRANKENHOOKER) as a late-nite, home-taped double featureâ€”complete with local TV commercials and a new synthesizer score from Taken by Savages (JUNGLE TRAP). Inspired by hazy memories of channel-surfing at the witching hour, this is a nostalgic and experimental art project from the minds behind Bleeding Skull.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/epFGSiVE995UJSR3KPil4tme8dH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"PHANTASMATAPES","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5632041,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annie Choi","original_name":"Annie Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68af16c22f9a6a5536624bff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph A.
