They were awoke by the loud noise of sirens and the roar of thousands of screamings. They picked what they could, between what was the camcorder. They switched it on and started recording what their eyes could not believe: the savage assault and destruction of the largest protest camp ever raised in the Sahara: Gdeim Izik. Tried to contact international press but their satellite phone had been disabled. Antonio and Isabel had to find a way to show these images to the world. It wouldn't be easy. They would have to spend nine days hidden in a safe house during one of the most obscure incidents in the Moroccan history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":234139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quepo Cooperativa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gdeim Izik, the Sahrwi's resistance camp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lluís María Güell","original_name":"Lluís Maria Güell","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68aee47dc1a9065f48f391e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":356811,"name":"occupied territories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
