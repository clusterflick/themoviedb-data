The mouse nibbles at the fringe on the carpet and the trash can. And then there's the hazelnut. It gets up on the table and sees a pencil-very suitable for nibbling. The pencil asks him to wait - it wants to draw something for the last time. First the cheese is drawn, then the apple is added, and then the sausage. But when the pencil adds a mustache to the drawing, it turns out that it is a cat. The mouse is afraid and runs away.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1958-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mouse and a Pencil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mouse and Pencils","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Mishok i moliv","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radka Bachvarova","original_name":"Radka Bachvarova","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ae202605b4c3e560390314","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1121919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radka Bachvarova","original_name":"Radka Bachvarova","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ae202cc1a9065f48f38f5f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2780578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zdenka Doitcheva","original_name":"Zdenka Doitcheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ae203709d70c6ae74eb9b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2780578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zdenka Doitcheva","original_name":"Zdenka Doitcheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ae20405fac1ed38439035e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0348678","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
