Baldessari describes photographs from National Geographic magazine to Ed Henderson, who picks out pieces of mood-setting stock music and sound effects to pair with the images. Baldessari subtly influences Henderson's selections, steering him towards music that he deems more appropriate. This strange collaboration results in an uncanny, often comic conjunction of sound and image. Removing the photographs and music from their original contexts, Baldessari deconstructs mass cultural narrative, suggesting how the associative meanings and evocations of its cliches and genres have permeated the collective unconscious.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ed Henderson Suggests Sound Tracks for Photographs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Henderson","original_name":"Ed Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5de2ba7b3faba000130ab3fb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Baldessari","original_name":"John Baldessari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/hkB0IlAKqzDNJlE83ubQSR1ZVpy.jpg","credit_id":"5de2baa34f5801000f01b211","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
