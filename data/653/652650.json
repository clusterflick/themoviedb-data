A violent and tough character, Frank fails to see his wife’s growing despair due to his lack of affection. When he discovers her with her lover, he shots them both and goes to jail, leaving behind a heartbroken Rose who, after having experienced relentless harassment by two aggressive suitors, misses her one true chance at love. The opera ends by showing the streets of New York City moving on from these mundane events in total indifference.","popularity":0.4548,"poster_path":"/2XWiQoR1y70iOCoSWRMjNoPpKmW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel Air Classique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurt Weill: Street Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kurt Weill: Street Scene","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Szot","original_name":"Paulo Szot","popularity":0.1707,"profile_path":"/p149GSw6igp7Clex4QEK7FWewca.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank Maurrant","credit_id":"5de3f22f0cd4460012396aa4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Racette","original_name":"Patricia Racette","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5mKLGL5E43tOR9JOvhQr6JGYXNv.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Anna Maurrant","credit_id":"5eda58a51b157d001f5de8a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Bevan","original_name":"Mary Bevan","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rose Maurrant","credit_id":"5de3f24fc51acd0015fa5953","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Prieto","original_name":"Joel Prieto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sam Kaplan","credit_id":"5de3f25ec51acd0013fa7b3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Schaufer","original_name":"Lucy Schaufer","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Emma Jones","credit_id":"5de3f2783faba000130ce49e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeni Bern","original_name":"Jeni Bern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Greta Fiorentino","credit_id":"5de3f284a7e36300146ba0cd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael J.
