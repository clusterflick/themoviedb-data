Fortunately, this one by Karl Bohm, recorded live in Vienna's Musikvereinssaal, is excellent, as are the other Mozart symphonies on this DVD. Since this disc offers three of the big six last symphonies of Mozart, Nos. 35 (Haffner), 40, and 41 (Jupiter), plus two more, it is an outstanding value. Despite the age of the recordings (1973-74), both the sound and the video are quite good.","popularity":0.2246,"poster_path":"/yo10XhBaKy7lUMcBlypZM0kiRO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart Symphonies Vol. I - Nos. 29,34,35,40,41 and Minuet K.409","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Böhm","original_name":"Karl Böhm","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":"/vWn2Ys2AMzlULNwpFszYCbiyPfO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5de56ad80cd44600123bd1e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff35d2dfbe36f0041f880c7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"63761b552faf4d0076dd4eee","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Käch","original_name":"Hugo Käch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/kMcj686ZnROznzDawUFgoCSiduG.jpg","credit_id":"5de56ae83faba000130f6c75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yo10XhBaKy7lUMcBlypZM0kiRO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
