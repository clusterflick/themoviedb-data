As in Cervantes's tale, Don Quixote is persistent in his belief in chivalry and honor. He clings to the old ways and is reluctant to give way to modern behaviors. He sees things in a different way, the smoke stack of a factory is a beast to be conquered, his bicycle is his trusty steed and the hapless man stranded by a transit strike who tries to help suddenly finds himself to be the sidekick to the deluded Quixote.","popularity":1.402,"poster_path":"/nLII3kuxPUfXglUYmvlZjREUJcN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Heroes realize their dreams.
