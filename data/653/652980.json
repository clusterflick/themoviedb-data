Ever since its inception, this has been extensively exploited by Western propaganda. The notions about it are based in the general public on the fact that it was created to prevent people from traveling as they wish, from escaping. The wall that separates West Berlin from East Berlin is considered a crime against humanity. The truth is that the wall has caused many tragedies, the people on both sides of it are hermetically sealed off from each other. Those who are indignant about the existence of the wall, base their opinion entirely on the propaganda, which in the Cold War game manipulated the background to its creation. The film shows how necessary it was for East Germany to effectively close its border and the consequences of that for West Berlin.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":"/qdXJACYSXzY56Q3sBhKokYL4ona.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin - Divided City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1017239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lennart Malmer","original_name":"Lennart Malmer","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a7dbcf4b0c630129e35de5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1017239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lennart Malmer","original_name":"Lennart Malmer","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de57fc9cf4b8b0013251ea9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Rudorf-Lohmann","original_name":"Axel Rudorf-Lohmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de57fbc3faba000130f9e15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26661462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qdXJACYSXzY56Q3sBhKokYL4ona.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
