Yet his recordings with the Vienna Symphony demonstrate a mutual sympathy and deep love for this timeless music. The musicians are razor-sharp in attack, harmony, and release. Böhm's style is minimalist: a firm downbeat, a ruffled hand here and there, a slight sway, no mugging. Occasionally, when quite excited, he gives a little hop but immediately pulls himself on a tight leash.","popularity":0.3339,"poster_path":"/gCG1gcVC56nkbVuQIiN2tsbmOnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart Symphonies Vol. II - Nos. 1,25,31,36,38 and \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\"","video":true,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Böhm","original_name":"Karl Böhm","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":"/vWn2Ys2AMzlULNwpFszYCbiyPfO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5de5495911386c0011514d65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff35d4446e75f003ed5c0b6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"63761bca2faf4d007f316aac","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Käch","original_name":"Hugo Käch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/kMcj686ZnROznzDawUFgoCSiduG.jpg","credit_id":"5de54ee8a7e36300196dc060","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gCG1gcVC56nkbVuQIiN2tsbmOnl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
