Here, however, she makes ravishing use of those bits of tone that only she can produce: those instances of coloratura and dramatic legato with little asides and small florishes of style that suggest her intelligent approach and her high degree of musical involvement in this role. She does this in her I Puritani and her Anna Bolena, less so in Roberto Deveraux and Maria Stuarda(both sets).  Listen to Addio del passato and the Sempre Libra...ravishing, yes, but there are again those nuances learned from Callas that she makes her own. A very singualr perform,ance, and extremely moving with its detail and cry for pity throughout..from the start even.  Neil Schicoff is excellent, not an unworthy Alfredo at all! His is a great lyric tenor voice that should have been in the top line.","popularity":0.2703,"poster_path":"/4w7UItNyMgLeubYWbxcpDqZg2Ei.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12638,"logo_path":null,"name":"NVC Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1992-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi La Traviata","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edita Gruberova","original_name":"Edita Gruberova","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/jTnIow3oECe4OAS7XlZEDEnHMAc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Violetta","credit_id":"5de21757c51acd0011f780e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Shicoff","original_name":"Neil Shicoff","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/brv47iF9I4lK26FJGOdV9EoPAUU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alfredo","credit_id":"5de217784f58010016005177","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Zancanaro","original_name":"Giorgio Zancanaro","popularity":0.0653,"profile_path":"/9jtHkaI7rYp4dNdoDJwojCfPks9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Germont","credit_id":"5de217a73faba000150ac0a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Pentcheva","original_name":"Mariana Pentcheva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Flora","credit_id":"5de2181d3faba0001309b380","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonella Trevisan","original_name":"Antonella Trevisan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"5de21857dcb6a300186ce0a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max René Cosotti","original_name":"Max René Cosotti","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gaston","credit_id":"5de2186b4f58010012008c42","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orazio Mori","original_name":"Orazio Mori","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Barón Douphol","credit_id":"5de218863faba0001309b455","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Musinu","original_name":"Francesco Musinu","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Doctor Grenvil","credit_id":"5de218a4c51acd0011f78368","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Maria Orecchia","original_name":"Paolo Maria Orecchia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Marqués D'Obigny","credit_id":"5de218bac51acd0015f6bde9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383709,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlo Rizzi","original_name":"Carlo Rizzi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5de218cc3faba000150ac10f","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Bailey","original_name":"Derek Bailey","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de218e8c51acd0011f783e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de218f7c51acd0011f78405","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4w7UItNyMgLeubYWbxcpDqZg2Ei.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"VM14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
