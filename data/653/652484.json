As he lies there bleeding all over his floorboards, Nicely recalls the case that led to his death: a tail job for a classy dame named Brigid Astor, who thought her husband was stepping out on her. Turns out the husband ain't the adulterous type and the dame ain't so classy. But then, Brigid has her own story to tell: a deadly ride through the post-war underworld of gangsters, showbiz and forbidden love.
