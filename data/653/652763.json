As the director of the National Butterfly Center, Marianna Trevino Wright has become a leader of wall resistance in the Valley, a position that has resulted in violent threats from pro-wall factions and an emotional odyssey as she tries to navigate the ever-shifting sands of border policy. Zulema Hernandez, a life-long migrant worker, immigrant and great grandmother, has been a dedicated advocate for all migrants, both wild and human-kind. Meanwhile the butterfly, la mariposa, fights its own daily battle for survival in a landscape where more than 95 percent of its habitat is long gone and much of what remains lies directly in the path of the wall. Ay Mariposa documents each characters' fierce commitment to home, justice, wild beauty and the future of the US-Mexico borderlands.","popularity":0.0969,"poster_path":"/8Nx5uDHQyoXgxRqA9UJ3QrAnVBT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pongo Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Butterflies and Border Walls","title":"Ay Mariposa","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenny Nichols","original_name":"Jenny Nichols","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de477e3c51acd0015fb5064","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krista Schlyer","original_name":"Krista Schlyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de476227646fd001393910a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Heim","original_name":"Morgan Heim","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de47805c51acd0015fb5102","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10307890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwUq9LtqC2ErjKIFqVjEmOIZ3dw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Nx5uDHQyoXgxRqA9UJ3QrAnVBT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ay Mariposa (Trailer) - SF Green Film Festival 2019","key":"hND3g_D7x-4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-30T00:18:02.000Z","id":"64759a72dd2589013f2de1ec"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ay Mariposa Trailer","key":"347416276","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-11T00:16:12.000Z","id":"5de475f43faba000190eaacc"}]}}}
