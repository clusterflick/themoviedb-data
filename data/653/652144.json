Having made his famous 1966 studio recording of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" in Vienna, Bernstein re-recorded this in Israel with the same searing subjectivity. Ren√© Kollo draws on the voice of a great Wagner tenor, while Christa Ludwig, the greatest exponent of the contralto songs at the time, is unbearably poignant in the final movement's fusion of elation and sadness.","popularity":0.5154,"poster_path":"/hWOSgpudGmt3yi82Bzv4pQ7fyeq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2005-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler - Symphonies Nos. 9 & 10 / Das Lied von der Erde","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5de144ab0cd4460014345053","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Israel Philharmonic Orchestra","original_name":"Israel Philharmonic Orchestra","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff35d721d3563003e0f93e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff35d79f794ad003c74de92","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de144cbdcb6a300136bbb38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hWOSgpudGmt3yi82Bzv4pQ7fyeq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":802},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dHoCYl5mNCEtc2sJgKtP1GHNudE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t0zCnLUn48g93rVxJoc5BcSEPyn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":928}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
