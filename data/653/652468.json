Data gathered with the latest digital technologies has enabled Tsiaras and his team to construct, system by system, comprehensive three-dimensional animations of both male and female forms. Muscles and skeleton, the mechanics of digestion, the circadian rhythms of the heart, the intricacy of the brain and nerve network, all are manifested here and paralleled with the real-life anatomies of rock climbers, swimmers, and basketball players in lucid movement demonstrations.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/ljHAmJ4f3HN1wAMV4Bs0I7NaoC3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architecture and design of man and woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0450969","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ljHAmJ4f3HN1wAMV4Bs0I7NaoC3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
