Hall and Oates and Mitchie Brusco. Yoda, PLG, and Tom Schaar. All of these characters appear in CampLibs, a creative film that follows Dave Palazzese on his quest to conquer the Mini MegaRamp at Camp Woodward.  This film takes the conventional mold of storytelling and twists it with a Madlib approach allowing Woodward campers to fill in the blanks of the original script.
