Humphrey Burton's direction is, as always, very fine, giving the viewer/listener both the larger picture and highlighting individual soloists, players or groups of musicians and, of course, the maestro. The video and audio tracks show their age, but are quite acceptable even for today's standards. Bernstein's Seventh is everything one could desire: dark and spooky, highly sensual, but also structurally strong and assertive where needed. Bernstein's reading does not gloss over breakdowns in tonality and the foreshadowing of later musical developments.","popularity":0.4266,"poster_path":"/z3R3NIDORi6f2oBPM7PAFoWdBmr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1975-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler - Symphonies Nos. 7 & 8","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de195c7a24c500017332fd3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edda Moser","original_name":"Edda Moser","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/c2ceUvkTy7fJu4AvYKnXodMIiSy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196734f5801000fffa2c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Blegen","original_name":"Judith Blegen","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/an1iMGnasXWk1YRxNw6SFOMzZbo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196850cd446001434c45a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerti Zeumer","original_name":"Gerti Zeumer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de19699dcb6a300186c215b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Mayr","original_name":"Ingrid Mayr","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/26Oq9Ltp7wQxlGwvTBWs5t1uA9x.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196ab3faba0001509dd56","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Baltsa","original_name":"Agnes Baltsa","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/kR8T4xiKWVSa6zo4uVppHgH9y6U.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196b64f58010016ffaa17","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Riegel","original_name":"Kenneth Riegel","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/B7lzEPMIY8W5OkzF7cE8vCai63.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196caa24c5000173331bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Prey","original_name":"Hermann Prey","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/ryEWZxs7ukCREWcRaxqenrHR9Yc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196e44f58010012ffcead","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José van Dam","original_name":"José van Dam","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/ogj5ITifaFJeg89UY4WDIu5sUTr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5de196f3a24c500013334a26","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff91735fcec2e003e13bded","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de195d8c51acd0011f6c8f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1449,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z3R3NIDORi6f2oBPM7PAFoWdBmr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":966},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/siUyg3GrjECcpWcBzKalOCyXfTU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1975-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
