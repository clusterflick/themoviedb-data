It is beautiful in every way--vocally, scenically, sonically, and visually--and a worthy record of Van Dam's farewell. Van Dam is just shy of 70 in this production, but you would never guess it from his singing or stage movements--a consummate artist. His is a noble portrayal and deeply moving. The Act V death scene is a model of beautiful singing and acting.","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":"/5buGPIZdr2DCAuw6O7ZtZn1ljoi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Naive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Quichotte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José van Dam","original_name":"José van Dam","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/ogj5ITifaFJeg89UY4WDIu5sUTr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Quichotte","credit_id":"5de190c74f58010016ffa4e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Tro Santafé","original_name":"Silvia Tro Santafé","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dulcinee","credit_id":"5de19114a894d600181c8208","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Van Mechelen","original_name":"Werner Van Mechelen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sancho Panza","credit_id":"5de191363faba00019095370","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Mossay","original_name":"Julie Mossay","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pedro","credit_id":"5de191553faba0001509d5d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Mercks","original_name":"Camille Mercks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Garcias","credit_id":"5de19191c51acd0015f60752","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gijs Van Der Linden","original_name":"Gijs Van Der Linden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Juan","credit_id":"5de191c5dcb6a300136c434a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Delhoume","original_name":"Vincent Delhoume","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rodriguez","credit_id":"5de191ec4f58010016ffa625","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Villiers","original_name":"Bernard Villiers","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Chef de Bandits","credit_id":"5de19217c51acd0013f63bb8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Minkowski","original_name":"Marc Minkowski","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/o5Az1vnk5zowbyj37xLwNqYMmB7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5de192253faba0001509d6ba","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Pelly","original_name":"Laurent Pelly","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de19241dcb6a300116c1db1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572004,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henri Cain","original_name":"Henri Cain","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de19273a894d600181c83d5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jules Massenet","original_name":"Jules Massenet","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/fMB6VUi0gIcQEu3WBoP7G8rQMCD.jpg","credit_id":"5de192810cd4460019355688","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5buGPIZdr2DCAuw6O7ZtZn1ljoi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
