Nevertheless, a little community holds out here. In a flawlessly filmed portrait of this extraordinary place, the theme linking the residents is their determination to chart their own course. Bardak was a marine, but his garrison broke up and his comrades sought a better life elsewhere. He stayed behind among the many empty buildings that are slowly but surely being consumed by the elements. Meanwhile, Dima, a young poacher​, flouts as many rules as he can, but gives friendly directions to lost tourists and reads lovingly to his little daughter. Ferryman Alexander is locked in a silent generational battle with his teenage daughter Masha; her eyes are on the outside world. Further along, a little team of ships from the Second World War turns up, and a woman steadfastly runs a weather station.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/qO0bWWUQYOpLwNWXRFbnILGCkXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126028,"logo_path":"/yndYEY6VFhLVEx8byXskI3FJnL0.png","name":"Blackchamber","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":8152,"logo_path":"/shnLD1Pj9d1vB2TH93QHSNT5gzW.png","name":"DFI","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Froth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Pena","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2473318,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandr Krotov","original_name":"Alexandr Krotov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de5437f0cd44600143b582c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2418320,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Shalashina","original_name":"Anna Shalashina","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de54154cf4b8b001324b4b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044360,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Evgeny Rodin","original_name":"Evgeny Rodin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de5418b3faba000130f26d6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2102432,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yaroslav Kozlov","original_name":"Yaroslav Kozlov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de54177a7e36300146e12e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2102428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Povolotsky","original_name":"Ilya Povolotsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jfQcdBq2q93Dt9F926zLaGhjsat.jpg","credit_id":"5de543ae11386c001351bb0b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2102428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Povolotsky","original_name":"Ilya Povolotsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jfQcdBq2q93Dt9F926zLaGhjsat.jpg","credit_id":"5de5431b3faba00015103734","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2102433,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ekaterina Krasovitskaya","original_name":"Ekaterina Krasovitskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de541833faba000191029e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2102428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Povolotsky","original_name":"Ilya Povolotsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jfQcdBq2q93Dt9F926zLaGhjsat.jpg","credit_id":"5de541447646fd001394f25b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2188627,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anton Koloskov","original_name":"Anton Koloskov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de543657646fd001194f299","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68524,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrey Dergachev","original_name":"Andrey Dergachev","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/biMBQ01hBe1wYNXYTYyPcXRRIFW.jpg","credit_id":"5de543a711386c0016516fee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2473317,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sasha Kletsov","original_name":"Alexandr Kletsov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5de543443faba000130f2ac6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10417688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4fTISbQt7tmVWvpTlaIrKALWMRI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qO0bWWUQYOpLwNWXRFbnILGCkXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/A2icQfn1EUs5Y2ub0bMsrUKw8lb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA)","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Documentary Film Festival DOKer","release_date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FROTH -
