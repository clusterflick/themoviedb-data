Twenty-five years later, his nephew, Aaron, sets out on a quest to find the lost negative of Burroughs: The Movie, his uncle's critically-acclaimed portrait of legendary author William S. Burroughs. When Aaron uncovers Howard's extensive archive in Burroughs’ bunker, it not only revives the film for a new generation, but also opens a vibrant window on New York City’s creative culture from the 1970s and ‘80s, and inspires a wide-ranging exploration of his beloved uncle's legacy.","popularity":1.7189,"poster_path":"/qEiCXG0pF58EvnQIb7pn14tyUqf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle Howard","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Andy Warhol e lo Zio Howard","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Brookner","original_name":"Howard Brookner","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/zEDRT4EdjZgCqA42V8KoXGc11MO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e9d163aa5046e001d99f118","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Brookner","original_name":"Aaron Brookner","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9d13914a4bfc001ed73551","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Giorno","original_name":"John Giorno","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/uE8MVuHEpuEiqgmUg5c0Dg6hzKO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9d13a14a4bfc0023d7509e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9d13b6310325001ac967d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom DiCillo","original_name":"Tom DiCillo","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/z8XD6BdliptWiaGP49yYNR2OTTR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9d13c9371097001c4923c0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550552,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Grauerholz","original_name":"James Grauerholz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9d13ddf6fd180022e60eb3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Driver","original_name":"Sara Driver","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/ncMS3ap5sRiUcMQahaG65IquogM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e9d1406a5046e001d99eec3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William S.
