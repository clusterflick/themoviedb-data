His best friend, Sang-chul, is yet to find direction in his life but always lives by his life motto: to live and die for his friends. Dong-leung, a naive and timid student, consistently lacks the courage to live on his own and always submits to his father's orders. Although radically different in personalities, San-hae, Sang-chul, and Dong-leung are the best of friends. Then one day, while gambling on a card game, they inherit a run-down bar. Initially excited about their earnings, the three friends later realize that running a bar is far from easy. Then San-hae comes up with an idea to bring in customers; he decides to create a bartending extravaganza entitled \"The Show\", a brand new concept in Seoul during the 1970s.","popularity":0.2549,"poster_path":"/xKcqu7Z5Q4dFJDpQRCuNT7yXgs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2003-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Show Show Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"쇼쇼쇼","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu Jun-sang","original_name":"유준상","popularity":0.8808,"profile_path":"/xAyOtT2ku17QBsLW5NBaYaaYuok.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"San-Hae","credit_id":"5679335dc3a3684757002394","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Sun-kyun","original_name":"이선균","popularity":1.0628,"profile_path":"/nHFBbSFohzOUOvMxPVwe3Es2nJw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sang-cheol","credit_id":"5679342e9251411181002551","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Tae-ri","original_name":"이태리","popularity":0.7629,"profile_path":"/fmAWXeOk5zDXSf56Ud3zjTRHqNR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Eun Ryong","credit_id":"66d6fa848bc613d70a818147","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ho-jeong","original_name":"Kim Ho-jeong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64aeb8948a0e9b00adac5054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316170,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Kim Eun-suk","original_name":"Kim Eun-suk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd2141c1d1bf4003ecb5c7c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0350121","wikidata_id":"Q17564582","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1007,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKcqu7Z5Q4dFJDpQRCuNT7yXgs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
