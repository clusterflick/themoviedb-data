Squirrels rely not just on memory but also on an enhanced sense of smell to locate their stashes of nuts under the snow. A particular species of woodpecker carves a deep, roomy hole in a dense white pine for a nest, feasting on the ants it somehow knows are inside. And a coniferous tree native only to this region has devised an ingenious way of self-defense. The question is not how cold is cold, but how to exist in spite of it all.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/k5TTcgKqCcBSbboMGkDIjlZLJt8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Furano: Life in Hokkaido's Frozen Forest","title":"Furano: Life in Hokkaido's Frozen Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k5TTcgKqCcBSbboMGkDIjlZLJt8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
