It alludes to Polly, 1728, John Gay’s censored sequel to the popular Beggar’s Opera, 1727, which resurrected the character of the robber Macheath in the disguise of the African pirate captain Morano, scheming to take revenge on a colony in the West Indies, and is populated by many of the characters made popular by Gay and Brecht. The film features the naïve and incorruptible Polly, the vengeful whore Jenny Diver, and the treacherous and greedy Peachum – fencer, thief-taker and king of the beggars – and portrays them surviving in a lawless zone, set to be redeveloped into luxury waterside living, as a comment on the social struggles against gentrification and privatisation.","popularity":0.0576,"poster_path":"/akkSuskNXMmJXuGIWAYajgrQupP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polly II - Plan for a Revolution in Docklands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Kean","original_name":"Sara Kean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Polly Peachum","credit_id":"611b65a52dc44e0045bc0186","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Foster","original_name":"Lorraine Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lorraine","credit_id":"611b65c0d1a893005c268517","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Zort","original_name":"Shirley Zort","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kerry","credit_id":"611b65d0151c5c005c7103e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2244946,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthony Iles","original_name":"Anthony Iles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"611b65e187f3f2002c340d15","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Luis Mueller","original_name":"Sophie Luis Mueller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jenny Diver","credit_id":"611b668433ec26002ee50bcd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja Kirschner","original_name":"Anja Kirschner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611b655fc14fee004531cefe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95910,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nick Gordon Smith","original_name":"Nick Gordon Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611b6573514c4a00299cbec1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja Kirschner","original_name":"Anja Kirschner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567525de92514179e70021a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/akkSuskNXMmJXuGIWAYajgrQupP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":1723,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGeKUrHH9iW0k24ERZXM5dREDr2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
