One day, Malte finds an abandoned baby. He immediately takes the little one to his heart and wants to look after the child until he finds the birth mother. His brother Arne doesn't like the idea at all, but Malte wants to go through with the plan and even threatens to sell his brother the scrapyard. Disgruntled, Arne finally agrees and, as Malte is fully occupied with caring for the baby, sets off on a laborious search for the raven mother.","popularity":0.8457,"poster_path":"/fv6Iga6oq3bUpFcF6SuyWva8slH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":680,"logo_path":"/2GQ81QeLGGR9qnYhqGuDoYdsPw4.png","name":"Studio Hamburg
