The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum's Avro Lancaster, VeRA, flew from Hamilton, Ontario to meet her British counterpart, Thumper - the only other surviving flight worthy Lancaster bomber in the world - the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's (BBMF) Lancaster in England.  This documentary includes first-hand accounts from the men and women who experienced the war and were connected to the Lancaster. It transports the viewer back in time as they share what it was like during the Lancaster's glory days.  REUNION OF GIANTS documents this historic mission as it unfolds through the eyes of the flight crews, veterans, friends and family. It includes all parts in this new chapter of the bomber's history, as VeRA crosses the Atlantic.","popularity":0.4968,"poster_path":"/nqGKe64DdE4yxwEh8bDHw99f3Xm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70406,"logo_path":"/3QLGzigQVzH1t5Uy8NBOcLepMjp.png","name":"Suddenly SeeMore Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are only two Avro Lancasters left flying in the world today and when they joined and flew together in 2014, it was HISTORY IN THE MAKING","title":"Reunion of Giants","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carla Jones","original_name":"Carla Jones","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56770675c3a368168e006ce2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258092,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morgan Elliott","original_name":"Morgan Elliott","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bpbg3Tmjlsw8WzUk0jwWNGqdd85.jpg","credit_id":"56770656c3a3681689006288","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258092,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morgan Elliott","original_name":"Morgan Elliott","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bpbg3Tmjlsw8WzUk0jwWNGqdd85.jpg","credit_id":"56770641c3a368168e006cdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4085458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qU6kCEePigOAHj1rVscPlCLqxLM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1781}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nqGKe64DdE4yxwEh8bDHw99f3Xm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":323,"name":"raf (royal air force)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":9863,"name":"lancaster bomber"},{"id":15126,"name":"historical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
