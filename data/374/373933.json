Composed of community-generated performances, re-enactments and extemporaneous recordings, this film functions doubly as an examination of a rapidly changing material culture in the present and as a historical document for the future. Whether the resultant record is directed towards its subjects, its temporary residents (filmmakers), or its Western viewers is a question proposed via the combination of long takes, materialist approaches, selective subtitling, and a focus on various forms of cultural labor.","popularity":0.1186,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SR","name":"Suriname"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tjúba Tén / The Wet Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1552953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigid McCaffrey","original_name":"Brigid McCaffrey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/b17jNfi09lsf84FHmxiuBccr1jJ.jpg","credit_id":"567afc149251417ddd00053c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Russell","original_name":"Ben Russell","popularity":0.1411,"profile_path":"/cbd0BcJbmA8zRIDxk3fZkb27XJZ.jpg","credit_id":"567afb7b9251417de3000557","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Onion City Experimental Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2008-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
