Life at Eden was filmed day after day from before the pit was even bought to the day it opened to a blaze of worldwide publicity. The Eden Project is a visitor attraction in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Inside the artificial biomes are plants that are collected from all around the world. The project is located in a reclaimed Kaolinite pit, located 2 km (1.2 mi) from the town of St. Blazey and 5 km (3 mi) from the larger town of St Austell, Cornwall. The complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant species, and each enclosure emulates a natural biome. The domes consist of hundreds of hexagonal and pentagonal, inflated, plastic cells supported by steel frames. The first dome emulates a tropical environment, and the second a Mediterranean environment.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/3GbRnGSIf06ssMXPiH4dp3gNqsS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where Architecture Meets Nature","title":"Eden: The Inside Story","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3GbRnGSIf06ssMXPiH4dp3gNqsS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
