Kasper Holten’s production (The Royal Opera’s first) of Król Roger (King Roger) brought the opera back to the London stage after an absence of almost 40 years. Karol Szymanowski’s masterpiece powerfully presents the dilemmas of culture versus nature and man versus beast, and movingly depicts King Roger’s inner struggles as he moves from an impossible life of repressed desires to the other extreme, giving in to his own demons. Meanwhile, Roger’s people, seduced by the promises of the mysterious Shepherd, are drawn towards totalitarianism and repression. Antonio Pappano conducts Szymanowksi’s opulent and beautiful score, with a cast including Mariusz Kwiecień as Roger (one of the greatest interpreters of the role today), Saimir Pirgu as the Shepherd, and Georgia Jarman in her Royal Opera debut as Roger’s loving queen Roxana.","popularity":0.2795,"poster_path":"/vYrI4q6tbI8YWxZkb5LDYd9nQEE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Król Roger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e2bf9251415b67005eb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariusz Kwiecien","original_name":"Mariusz Kwiecien","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/g6VZ03N0r0x1b2ASuogFdQLi6vd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e2fcc3a368746400187b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Jarman","original_name":"Georgia Jarman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e30a9251415fd80059af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saimir Pirgu","original_name":"Saimir Pirgu","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e31cc3a3684483005d17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Begley","original_name":"Kim Begley","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e32bc3a3683014005e39","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Ewing","original_name":"Alan Ewing","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e338925141609a005956","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Zwierko","original_name":"Agnes Zwierko","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e347c3a3683014005e42","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kasper Holten","original_name":"Kasper Holten","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/z4XegpLGt7Ktm1s9ev3EmqGJnrH.jpg","credit_id":"567b19c7c3a3684bd9000a0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607039,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karol Szymanowski","original_name":"Karol Szymanowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66044f3ed38b580131197050","department":"Writing","job":"Opera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5358330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/48A8h5vdZ9ZdnM5tdQBItYHWBhl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOYscF83JSAYY6BqenqqUMZXid5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ykKv3Hw3Riu6sSQkTv6tV6vn74.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mezg1506zcZqOQ5Jq9vCeuSyGXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jFRBnUMYDWNWmB0juYxHrqBda8I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vYrI4q6tbI8YWxZkb5LDYd9nQEE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":326218,"name":"gay subtext"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
