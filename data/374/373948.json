For the image we created a gridded score of movements, both within the frame ('subject moves right to left') and between the camera and the subject (zooms, pans, tilts...,) using this as a shooting script. The sound was derived from an old journal, read out loud and then cut-up into the same units of time as the image, ranging from 3 seconds to 1/4 second. Assembling the material was largely mechanical, following the predetermined score. That a tonal portrait of a person emerges was an after effect; we thought of the film as a structural or indexical system of sound/image relations, and viewed the soundtrack as a linguistic experiment, working with the building blocks of speech. - LT","popularity":0.0615,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X-TRACTS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Thornton","original_name":"Leslie Thornton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567b17f59251417ddf000a39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Desmond Horsfield","original_name":"Desmond Horsfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567b18039251417de300097f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Thornton","original_name":"Leslie Thornton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567b180ec3a3684bc90009f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Desmond Horsfield","original_name":"Desmond Horsfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567b18179251417de3000986","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Desmond Horsfield","original_name":"Desmond Horsfield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567b1823c3a3684bcc0009e3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8244722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
