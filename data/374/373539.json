Fontana makes his entrance on this beautifully produced show in a hot air balloon surrounded by large toy airplanes that drop from the ceiling as the Choir opens with the number \"The Candyman/Pocketful of Miracles.\" Other standout moments are a duet with the Count and the Choir's organist, Richard Elliott, to the tune of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\" a medley of songs from Sesame Street® as well as the popular \"Keep Christmas With You,\" and hilarious hijinks and banter from the Muppets® from Sesame Street® throughout the show. This show is a world-class performance perfect for all ages as you celebrate the Christmas holiday.","popularity":0.9859,"poster_path":"/3Hu9RUDKslInZ2HhjPPJl55t261.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mormon Tabernacle","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Keep Christmas With You","title":"Keep Christmas With You","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir & Orchestra","type":"Series Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santino Fontana","original_name":"Santino Fontana","popularity":0.4633,"profile_path":"/3EtNGPVBN5bBamV817n43kFd4MB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Santino Fontana","credit_id":"5677400b925141691a003375","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Vogel","original_name":"Matt Vogel","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/oRWKHxkG90AZKxxJaGKzKYlKFCD.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Big Bird / The Count","credit_id":"61c2ce1a544c410097b5e9da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1213631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Carrara-Rudolph","original_name":"Leslie Carrara-Rudolph","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/gT1BRQJ0vsC4HgMfYSNMZiBoHy3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Abby Cadabby","credit_id":"61c2cd97bb105700a07117f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Osbahr","original_name":"Carmen Osbahr","popularity":0.1341,"profile_path":"/w8LnIlRKbVA0vhzFCHWD1NFkAbw.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Rosita","credit_id":"61c2ce02e258600041fcc6f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2452629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Dillon","original_name":"Ryan Dillon","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/lvnMJfeubWplY7U262GPyasbHbD.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Elmo","credit_id":"61c2cdafa88587001cd1bf75","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Jacobson","original_name":"Eric Jacobson","popularity":0.2344,"profile_path":"/bB4DRQwKUswG8uvFmDDHHWFwzlz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Grover / Bert","credit_id":"61c2cdbf3fe797001c2d7f6b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Rudman","original_name":"David Rudman","popularity":0.5761,"profile_path":"/lHk21OS9k5aeACDSYJFBaJgMrCP.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Cookie Monster","credit_id":"61c2ce0ce25860006060e641","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2839864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Barkhurst","original_name":"Billy Barkhurst","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xpnUvxCVnH2c0Om8aHQFIKr0xwW.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Ernie","credit_id":"658b03ad5aba3267aab9aad3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":360193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Linz","original_name":"Peter Linz","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/hQZzWLqAK1sf45ddLCMh6Yuiaai.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Additional Muppets","credit_id":"61c2cdf3162bc30041b4fb7f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1233617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John E.
