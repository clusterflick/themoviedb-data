A thematic sequel to his movie filmed with Mexican peasants, here Groulx asks, by making a business man sing, a second question on happiness: this time about the ones for whom happiness is linked with the possession of overabundance. He delivers, by developing the theatrical dimension with great emphasis, a social pamphlet with a strong satirical charge that he himself qualified as a \"neo-surrealist fantasy\".","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/c7uOGmYtfm9HKiPozEybsAfH1hJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Au pays de Zom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Rouleau","original_name":"Joseph Rouleau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yZoKLQoDcMcoZ8pZ6xzBUllMOve.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"M Zom","credit_id":"5fa9cff46a300b003bf55659","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":548631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Berd","original_name":"Françoise Berd","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/ymExCTsnky6M3xs7Om9HHWSKJOK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mme.
