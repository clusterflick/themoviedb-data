This one is a short documentary about the 1945 atomic bombing and its devastating consequences. The film came out of the \"10 Foot Movement\". A movement organized by the Japan Peace Museum, which mobilized Japanese citizen activists to buy back small segments of film footage of the effects of the atomic bomb from the U.S. National Archives. The film combines recent footage of survivors of the atomic bomb with American archival footage, portraying the sorrow of atomic bomb survivors in the Cold War period.","popularity":0.2698,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prophecy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Yogen","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Knode","original_name":"Donald Knode","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"56c97430c3a3684089006a35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Caughlin","original_name":"Dan Caughlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"News Announcer","credit_id":"56c974539251411ea8006789","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susumu Hani","original_name":"羽仁進","popularity":0.1643,"profile_path":"/mrU4jbS4ixSK82HZYLOhAAP0swm.jpg","credit_id":"56c9738e9251414ae4002278","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580805,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tsutomu Iwakura","original_name":"Tsutomu Iwakura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c974c4c3a3684087006b69","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089041,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyushiro Kusakabe","original_name":"Kyushiro Kusakabe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c974d7c3a368408c00716a","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580806,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Umeko Numazaki","original_name":"Umeko Numazaki","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c9752c9251414ae40022cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580808,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Koji Okamoto","original_name":"Koji Okamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c97568925141239b001061","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175882,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yûji Okumura","original_name":"奥村祐治","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57171eeb9251412b3700014c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51808,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toru Takemitsu","original_name":"武満徹","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/l48fEVb1HGMilTCkxSzYuZsSPdk.jpg","credit_id":"57171ef6c3a3687fd6000155","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695740,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kenichi Isohata","original_name":"Kenichi Isohata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582583ce9251417b2c006968","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7024922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160381,"name":"nuclear weapons"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
