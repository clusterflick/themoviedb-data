MP finds himself confronted by a world in which there are no longer any certainties; an era of crisis on many levels. On his travels from country to country, portrayed via an associative image montage and through a series of strange, illuminating, sometimes comic encounters, MP attempts to gain insight into the complexity of life in the 21st-century West - into what commentators have called an age of 'rolling catastrophe'.","popularity":0.5229,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26389,"logo_path":"/eZG7nmYHpVpp6jsOytILEmITHNf.png","name":"Family Affair
