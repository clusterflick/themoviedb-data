The product of undersea earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, tsunamis can race across oceans at more than 500 miles an hour, leaving a huge wake of destruction when they hit shore. Because it is difficult for scientists to predict how large these massive waves can be, tsunamis are one of the least understood of nature's forces, and one of the most dangerous. With insight from some of the scientific community's foremost researchers, and vivid accounts from past tsunami survivors, Tsunami: Killer Wave depicts nature at its most extreme, profiles the efforts being made to curb its effects, and illustrates the financial, physical and emotional toll it can leave on its victims.","popularity":0.6737,"poster_path":"/ycb7d4jdk5RFXz06MoxUcZHIIzJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tsunami - Killer Wave","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261812,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Atkins","original_name":"Paul Atkins","popularity":0.247,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612caa40e8a3e10043f9d577","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551409,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Bernanke","original_name":"James Bernanke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5676456292514179db004c17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456123,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dena Seidel","original_name":"Dena Seidel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567645c8c3a368167a0050e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Bachar","original_name":"Kevin Bachar","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5676453dc3a368167c004d81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0465543","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1182,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fwW3TqbE9VV2diFT9Lig9jUB0Hu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":788},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ycb7d4jdk5RFXz06MoxUcZHIIzJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":6941,"name":"tsunami"},{"id":176690,"name":"waves"},{"id":213784,"name":"mother nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
