Briefly covering much of his early British works, the film primarily focuses on his American classics, such as \"Shadow of a Doubt\", \"Notorious\", \"Rear Window\", \"Vertigo\", \"Psycho\" and \"The Birds\". The movie also covers his television years and neatly examines the Hitchcock signature touches, from his inevitable brief cameo to his famous MacGuffin.","popularity":1.2687,"poster_path":"/2LyBEMvClxZzW1SVYctbhx08u4k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rocket Science Laboratories","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitchcock: Shadow of a Genius","video":false,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dial H for Hitchcock: The Genius Behind the Showman","type":"Television"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Spacey","original_name":"Kevin Spacey","popularity":1.8558,"profile_path":"/nPrUZDEbGQe6jwpVbHKJCXsMd7r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"56783abfc3a3684744000047","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Demme","original_name":"Jonathan Demme","popularity":0.5649,"profile_path":"/w9Lw3xTEFQUYELkl9AH5i3p5OhJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56783ad79251411183000054","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian De Palma","original_name":"Brian De Palma","popularity":1.0083,"profile_path":"/4xleWFdhtVC7faer6Ru2eyEgfTv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56783aecc3a3684747000060","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","original_name":"Peter Bogdanovich","popularity":0.8766,"profile_path":"/m3aMMYzzEbqKEwGOyEPq7Rt1gAj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56783b01c3a3684757000076","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Leigh","original_name":"Janet Leigh","popularity":1.8404,"profile_path":"/2dv9IqJEx31RSoH7xAHlJZXF5uB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5678412fc3a3684753000156","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curtis Hanson","original_name":"Curtis Hanson","popularity":0.4379,"profile_path":"/1ht0tJ0Icxc134W3ZpcGtwMtNLA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56784144c3a3684744000163","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Altman","original_name":"Robert Altman","popularity":0.6828,"profile_path":"/wB1R6patGi35oaxKU5PWEGJlIZg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6434b7bccca7de00e06ef921","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tippi Hedren","original_name":"Tippi Hedren","popularity":0.6526,"profile_path":"/7BrleQqFVU4d0sMDDHLbeJfyqBf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6434b7cd06f984007694d8f1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Haimes","original_name":"Ted Haimes","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56783a86925141118c000052","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0202907","wikidata_id":"Q3138620","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":938,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2LyBEMvClxZzW1SVYctbhx08u4k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":625}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235736,"name":"film director"},{"id":318723,"name":"alfred hitchcock"},{"id":322678,"name":"english"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
