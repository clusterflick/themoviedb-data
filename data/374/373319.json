Michelle is married to Gary, a young miner who goes on strike as soon as the dispute between the Thatcher government and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) begins. Meanwhile, her sister Linda's husband Paul is a local policeman. Paul becomes more and more voluble in his opposition to the strike, while Linda looks around her and witnesses the women of her community suddenly find a voice and independence. The scene is set for political and personal conflicts which would change their lives forever.","popularity":2.8163,"poster_path":"/p7rGFMQtWu3sPgfiry8O0j9j31v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105964,"logo_path":null,"name":"4Way
