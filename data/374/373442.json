On the one side is President Alan Garcia, who, eager to enter the world stage, begins aggressively extracting oil, minerals, and gas from untouched indigenous Amazonian land. He is quickly met with fierce opposition from indigenous leader Alberto Pizango, whose impassioned speeches against Garcia’s destructive actions prove a powerful rallying cry to throngs of his supporters. When Garcia continues to ignore their pleas, a tense war of words erupts into deadly violence.","popularity":2.0236,"poster_path":"/pWjhKfhkjFWTLZLqTp9d03ZJxKq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yachaywasi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Two Worlds Collide","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Lo scontro di due mondi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"2つの世界が衝突する時","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathew Orzel","original_name":"Mathew Orzel","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5676adcec3a368168900569e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1551513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heidi Brandenburg","original_name":"Heidi Brandenburg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6GeoxuMkftja3AaaI1QO0VgAbZ6.jpg","credit_id":"5676adeb92514179e7005937","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1571950,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carla Gutierrez","original_name":"Carla Gutierrez","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/tKa28fHH0ogNRsRWQITFEFJxZNM.jpg","credit_id":"56b1b873c3a36862090025e2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"H.
