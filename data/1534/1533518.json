There, in a place called “The Dog House”, he finds Professor Shiny in an electrified helmet and his daughter, who is now a corpse. The film was composed from words drawn from a Twitter bot, quoting existing words and images.  Directed by Shinji Aoyama in collaboration with Tama Art University, this rarely-seen experimental three-part series (2012–2015) explores cinema as a dynamic, living medium. Combining student-led production with theatrical adaptation and meta-narrative devices, FUGAKU challenges conventional filmmaking while interrogating the boundaries between fiction, reality, and creative education.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1FEFa0pd1P8viKM1xYoF5reAbUL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FUGAKU 1 / Zombies in the Dog House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Aoyama","original_name":"青山真治","popularity":0.666,"profile_path":"/x1s0DjsTFdu8l59eb8srzxuRpFS.jpg","credit_id":"68a72d97d0bd8096a4d5536f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1FEFa0pd1P8viKM1xYoF5reAbUL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
