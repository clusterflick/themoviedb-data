Clive's work with Utah Pioneer Heritage Arts leads him to spend a lot of time researching the history and heritage of that area. Some of the stories he finds find their way into his performances by way of songs paired with engaging narrations. That's what you'll find in Volume 2.  The Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area, created by an act of Congress in 2006, exists to tell the stories of Utah's pioneers - Mormons, Indigenous Peoples, and all others - in Sanpete, Sevier, Piute, Wayne, Garfield and Kane Counties.  This volume's stories are mainly from Sevier and Kane counties. But stories know no boundaries, and you'll find protagonists from these stories in other areas and other stories. And similar stories and found throughout Utah. The human experience is remarkably intertwined and remarkably similar.
