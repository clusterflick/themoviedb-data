Fed up with underfunded classrooms, uncertified teachers, and crumbling facilities, a group of young Mexican American students and their families organized a bold protest that would become a catalyst for statewide education reform.  Told through the voices of the original students, community leaders, and historians, The Walkout weaves together personal testimony, historical footage, and present-day reflections to honor the legacy of resistance born in San Antonio’s Westside. This film doesn’t just revisit the past; it also draws a direct line to today’s struggles over school funding and equity in Texas.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tta3rmemdKFYiVSWcgpoPfvxuNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":271818,"logo_path":null,"name":"H.
