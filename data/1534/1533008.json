Using stylised cinematography and shifting perspectives, including VHS footage with a friend behind the camera, the film reveals her delusional inner world. The film is aimed at those who seek subtle stories that resonate with their personal experiences and offer reflections on relationships with themselves and others.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2025-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Delulu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5637629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karolína Beranová","original_name":"Karolína Beranová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a5bf5eab5b487289bcb37f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
