But 1000 years ago they stood at the heart of a great Native American city.  Cahokia was a metropolis of thousands of people and grand monuments…a city of art, commerce, power, and wealth…a city whose inhabitants created the largest earthworks in ANCIENT AMERICA.  Cahokia was larger than London, Paris, or most European cities of its time. An impressive stockade enclosed the core of the city, and suburbs and satellite villages surround this heart of the Mississippian culture. Like England’s Stonehenge, Cahokia’s Woodhenge served as a giant solar calendar.  The reasons for the decline of Cahokia are not clear, but come explore the mysteries and the legacy of Cahokia in this fascinating look into the past.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/751Utg0hejkUpez4RZiJVqaN1xh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":271724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camera One","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cahokia Mounds: Ancient Metropolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5638240,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gray Warriner","original_name":"Gray Warriner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a606ed01e7fb6b975dd722","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5638240,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gray Warriner","original_name":"Gray Warriner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a6070d3b2f57dcfc3e879b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7hc4LZRuqava9xyWG1FhqBJOX1j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/751Utg0hejkUpez4RZiJVqaN1xh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
