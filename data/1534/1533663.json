Her mother, yearning for change, books a holiday at a new beach destination against her husband’s wishes, while 12-year-old Alma remains fixated on capturing the entire trip with her video camera. When it becomes clear that the new holiday spot isn’t suited to their needs, Alma tells a white lie – one her mother backs up. A series of disappointments follows, and as tensions between her parents reach breaking point, Alma must decide what to hold onto and what to let go. A tender film about growing up, denial, and the quiet sacrifices we make for love.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alma en route","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"af","note":"Silwerskerm film festival","release_date":"2025-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"af","note":"Kyknet","release_date":"2025-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
