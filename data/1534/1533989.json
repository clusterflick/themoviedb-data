Impelled by curiosity, Walter opens the will and discovers that his uncle has cut him off with a mere pittance, leaving the major portion of his estate to charity. He cleverly forges a new clause to the will, and is in the act of substituting it for the original when surprised by his uncle. After a heated argument, Howland dies of heart failure and Walter, panic-stricken, carries him to his own room and notifies the coroner. Later, Walter accompanies Gladys Brooks, with whom he is in love, to the retreat of a Hindoo mystic, a crystal gazer, who bares Walter's life while in a mesmeric trance.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":169912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pyramid Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crystal Ball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Hopkins","original_name":"Jack Hopkins","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/nTT38MfytJmfnWE9FOZRstTyQGX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Walter Deland","credit_id":"68a86e77851332f1478edc93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Swayne","original_name":"Marian Swayne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mL3K4B1gNFTpBCldmFdKJXxvwK7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gladys Brooks","credit_id":"68a86e89d6cf699011965670","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Bergman","original_name":"Henry Bergman","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":"/x41Z1XOGnBg6xnFhxunVQBmcJ36.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Business associate","credit_id":"68a86e9b480e7da60164657b","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2778998","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
