I cut up pieces of black paper and pasted them one by one on a white wall, then filmed them. I traced a photo book by Eadweard Muybridge to create the material. It was made on 8mm film. The background music uses some of the soundtrack from the film \"Ragtime.\" I created it with the sole focus of matching the music to the movement of the pictures and the scene changes. It is a memorable work for me.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/uHEhN4ezbK09a7CnTcmpr5EJZ9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RUNNING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2818539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshinao Satoh","original_name":"Yoshinao Satoh","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a735aabc2ea5b06fd553ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Randy Newman","original_name":"Randy Newman","popularity":0.2448,"profile_path":"/4tdkQXQEHY4B9V3RobHqpfQAKSg.jpg","credit_id":"68a735f5c297d5156b697998","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uHEhN4ezbK09a7CnTcmpr5EJZ9B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
