Neither entirely documentary nor pure performance, the film reveals a discreet artist and music played in all its fragility, carried by a dozen classical musicians. Between live sequences and stolen moments, the river becomes a mirror, and the landscapes, visual echoes of a music deeply rooted in its territory. A sober immersion in a work that slows down time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uGHzFr8sRqwo34J1L6eQpQOBuN4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":271894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Costume Records","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flore Laurentienne: The End and the Beginning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Flore Laurentienne à Saint-Pacôme","type":"Work Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858095,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillaume Monette","original_name":"Guillaume Monette","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/AgSROSdgGQdVEQK6axda6bVvTeM.jpg","credit_id":"68a86599b3e77bae0660da07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5641940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sébastien Paquin","original_name":"Sébastien Paquin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a865b8480e7da601646550","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2668932,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Rondeau","original_name":"William Rondeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a865be6f7f8e3c4160da7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5641941,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marc-André Laurin","original_name":"Marc-André Laurin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a865ce480e7da60164655a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5641942,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Léandre Bourgeois","original_name":"Léandre Bourgeois","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a865ddcaf7bfb5a8646593","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858095,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillaume Monette","original_name":"Guillaume Monette","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/AgSROSdgGQdVEQK6axda6bVvTeM.jpg","credit_id":"68a865e54d63b9c03e725254","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2860974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flore Laurentienne","original_name":"Flore Laurentienne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a866126275c28d25c56fc4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395632,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Charles-Étienne Pascal","original_name":"Charles-Étienne Pascal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a8661d560c74be4bc56f73","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGHzFr8sRqwo34J1L6eQpQOBuN4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":262706,"name":"music show"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Le Festival International du Film sur l’Art (Le FIFA), Montréal, Québec, Canada","release_date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
