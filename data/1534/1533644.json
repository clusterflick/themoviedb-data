Located at an altitude of 1,700 meters and difficult to access, it resembled an eagle's nest dominating the region, similar to certain war bunkers or hermitages clinging to the rocks. Who was the mysterious woman of noble origins for whom the building was constructed? A spy, as rumored, or an extravagant scholar in search of contemplative peace? Almost a century later, the enigma remains.  Through a lengthy investigation, the director delves into intricate events and complex historical periods in search of answers.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7zopYfsioQHSW0qVGR7ZRVCpENV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2025-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marquise, the Nun, the Mad and the Spy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Perrenoud","original_name":"Jennifer Perrenoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"68a7700717b939cfc93e8bad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonella Kurzen","original_name":"Antonella Kurzen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76f4f43a65f8c62697946","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonella Kurzen","original_name":"Antonella Kurzen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76f5ff1635a2145d55445","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640526,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandra Modugno","original_name":"Alessandra Modugno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76f6ef7f18a453ebcbab9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1006693,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Samir Samperisi\t","original_name":"Samir Samperisi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76f8f970bdaa5753e8c38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1006686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Merz","original_name":"Kevin Merz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76fa21061c253ded55508","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413347,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ariel Salati","original_name":"Ariel Salati","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76fafb63113462825f83d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640530,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dino Martignoni","original_name":"Dino Martignoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76fbb96b1e52396a81f25","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125130,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Dino Hodic","original_name":"Dino Hodic","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76fcad52b6cc0785ddc9f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640534,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Milena Stokar Von Neuforn","original_name":"Milena Stokar Von Neuforn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a76fde4b9cf27b073e8bf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Beltrami","original_name":"Michael Beltrami","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/y9MzYw3iM0D82ECTUjwMjv23vnb.jpg","credit_id":"68a76fecc94cc5f3a925f592","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7zopYfsioQHSW0qVGR7ZRVCpENV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"31.
