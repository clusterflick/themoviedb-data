In brief glimpses we get to see how the city is built – the water, the islands, the bridges and the mainland. Each inner city district is presented separately, where different buildings and places show each district's distinctive character. The most famous tourist attractions are included, as well as historical monuments and characteristic metropolitan phenomena. Housing, business, working life and communications are illustrated in short bursts of images. Finally, examples are given of problems and difficulties faced by city dwellers, but also the advantages of living in a big city – the wide range of culture and leisure on offer, for example.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pHAriYE71Wc5KHswEdR7d726APu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stockholm – Nordens Venedig","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pHAriYE71Wc5KHswEdR7d726APu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
