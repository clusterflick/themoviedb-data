Family stories led to Utah pioneer stories and that led to the founding of Utah Pioneer Heritage Arts, through which Clive encourages artists in all disciplines to use their art to tell the stories of Utah's settlement, which was unlike any in the world.  The Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area (MPNHA), created by an act of Congress in 2006, exists to tell the stories of Utah's pioneers - Mormons, Indigenous Peoples, and all others - in Sanpete, Sevier, Piute, Wayne, Garfield and Kane Counties.  Clive's involvement with and love of the MPNHA led him to focus his first storytelling DVD on stories from that area, though his interest extends to the entire state of Utah. There are thousands more stories to tell from the MPNHA alone. Volume One is only the beginning.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/b2eOBa1SHfj74u0Of8obQpwbBuF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories... from the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area - Volume 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b2eOBa1SHfj74u0Of8obQpwbBuF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
