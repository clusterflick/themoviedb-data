Six elderly Australian Greek Cypriots – aged 70 to 102 – reflect on their war-torn island, life in Australia and their desire to see unification with their Turkish Cypriot compatriots. Filmed in Greek, the documentary offers a powerful perspective on migration, displacement, identity, resilience and cultural legacy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2025-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Two Homelands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Δύο Πατρίδες","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1500191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kay Pavlou","original_name":"Kay Pavlou","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":"/rD5xvYFGLJKfwAkV17GW7EFMRw4.jpg","credit_id":"68a6315ba13eb9db686974bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qzMq1ZZH9mJoElbS3Ce1uf8MMZW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cklbB0EEDJlub05RDrheg6tzGDr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Greek Film Festival","release_date":"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
