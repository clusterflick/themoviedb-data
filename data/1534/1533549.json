Things go downhill from there, as Dorothy goes head-to-head (literally) against a skull-cracking Scarecrow, a Tin Man whose hobby is to collect still-beating hearts and a Cowardly Lion who pleases his master by ripping apart anyone he sees. Oz becomes Ooze as Dorothy – armed with scavenged weapons – battles her way through hordes of psychotic enemies until she finally happens upon her ultimate nemesis, the Wicked of Oz.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/jqGYlpBHefFlQiTs0vmBxz1MSJJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":271812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Insurgence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
