We explore the impact that slavery had on the development of black people mentally. In terms of personality, self esteem, self image, and also the entire maturation process people go through. Our contention is that slavery has certainly retarded that for slaves. And when slavery ended, jim crow, racial segregation, racial oppression continued many of the same aspects of slavery. That is: to create in black people a sense of inferiority. This film shows the view point on someone who claims to be conscious, but still be unable to balance real-world priorities and self-interest. Watch Kahlil rise against his enslaved mind and break the chains of psychological slavery.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":271830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Shade Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Black People is a story of a man trying to break the chains of psychological slavery.","title":"Black People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curtis Adams","original_name":"Curtis Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Barber","credit_id":"68a7809e56a9330e07d55255","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3000868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Igla","original_name":"Kimberly Igla","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Employer","credit_id":"68a780c92053e1290dd55287","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4308445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Micah Johnson","original_name":"Chad Micah Johnson","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/eSf8BAgBUThaSivgcJxHc1venvO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Employer #2","credit_id":"68a780dbab5b487289bcbabc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Mack","original_name":"Molly Mack","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"68a781000950ef4b83bcb8a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Monroe","original_name":"Bonnie Monroe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Customer","credit_id":"68a7811c7eef5f4afebcbeca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5640734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Rivers","original_name":"Chris Rivers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Customer #2","credit_id":"68a7813e56a9330e07d55269","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5521059,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Drew Lee Temple","original_name":"Drew Lee Temple","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kahlil (as Drew L.
