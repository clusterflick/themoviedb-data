Cradled by the mountains, far away from cis-society for a weekend, we existed on our own terms and built a world centering care. Far from being a commodified retreat, Camp Trans was a coming together of trans people to rest and restore our strength. Taking us back to the golden misty mornings, the waterfall and the campfire, this documentary explores how community care, trans ancestry and nature were the pillars of Camp Trans.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The River and The Glen: Camp Trans Scotland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4868449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Lacave-Fontourcy","original_name":"Jules Lacave-Fontourcy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a7645a43c40b84e3835608","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
