He is having a hard time financially, so he often steals jewelry from the corpses he conveys to the morgue. His ex-wife, Andri, works as a cleaner but she too is struggling financially since Kostas doesn't always pay in full the alimony they agreed upon. At the same time, he maintains a relationship with Elena, who lives with her mother.  One day, when he and his colleague Andreas are called upon to transport a deceased person, an elderly woman, Kostas steals a cross from the corpse and puts it with other stolen jewelry in a biscuit container that he hides in a kitchen cupboard. Things start to get complicated when Elena stays overnight at Kostas’ apartment, finds the container and makes a disturbing discovery.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":137484,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.B.
