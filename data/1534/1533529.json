Set on a university campus, the film parallels a gun battle between a group of people plotting to assassinate the ‘President’ and a conversation between students and professors who have gathered to compose the theme song for the university’s film festival.  Directed by Shinji Aoyama in collaboration with Tama Art University, this rarely-seen experimental three-part series (2012–2015) explores cinema as a dynamic, living medium. Combining student-led production with theatrical adaptation and meta-narrative devices, FUGAKU challenges conventional filmmaking while interrogating the boundaries between fiction, reality, and creative education.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FuGAK 3／Farewell, My Dear Eien.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenichiro Koidemizu","original_name":"Kenichiro Koidemizu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68a733924b9cf27b073e8b40","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Aoyama","original_name":"青山真治","popularity":0.666,"profile_path":"/x1s0DjsTFdu8l59eb8srzxuRpFS.jpg","credit_id":"68a7337aeb47669a45bcbc18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
