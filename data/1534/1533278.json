Having emigrated from Lithuania in 1923, Norman spent much of his career in the San Francisco Bay area. He approached creation through his analysis of society and his past in the military as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Norman produced more than 200 immense, complex works. Some of them, painted during the 1950s, are even visionary, depicting social realities that are relevant today. A film devoted to the life and work of an artist with a unique career.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yY5JWjpaFdgexho4z560L71V1XF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Truth Be Told: Irving Norman and the Human Predicament","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5638914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hela Norman","original_name":"Hela Norman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68a664e4a13eb9db68697578","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5638915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael S.
