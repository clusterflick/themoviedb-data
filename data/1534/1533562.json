The living dead, eaters of human flesh who are lurking in the Evans City Cemetery, are being gunned down and burned by an armed posse led by Sheriff Ken Johnson and Deputy Jeff Sanders. Dr. Harold Ormsby is also on the scene with a team of white-coated laboratory assistants, collecting zombie specimens by shooting them with immobilizing darts, the same way wild animals are captured for zoos. Their mission is to carry out experiments on the undead in hopes of finding out what caused the plague and how it can be cured.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/2dgyfhoDquhMs5geJ227jTlCcHD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mania Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":242434,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Co-Operative","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Spawn of the Living Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casper Van Dien","original_name":"Casper Van Dien","popularity":1.0984,"profile_path":"/jxRmw8gJYsJ7IG5n9B0PFzy2nHO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jeff Sanders","credit_id":"68a7438dc297d5156b6979ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Moseley","original_name":"Bill Moseley","popularity":0.4454,"profile_path":"/l2ksJH5uUCIaeTuier6wXrURrnv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Harold Ornsby","credit_id":"68a74397e7f41f625425f6c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Berryman","original_name":"Michael Berryman","popularity":0.6299,"profile_path":"/jnyXbS5NqYdfZyvRUX2PHeKuOg4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68a7439f31e18256b8697800","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kane Hodder","original_name":"Kane Hodder","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/avMGd9rA2ys1pJok1EGOa46MEQX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68a743aab579937917fd2c11","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trina Parks","original_name":"Trina Parks","popularity":0.1653,"profile_path":"/1ZpiTQksDTnbZJvSVF0cZoxnO3g.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Meg Mathews","credit_id":"68a743b34c7db4159c3e8e1a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
