Discover the reason behind Joseph Smith's involvement with Masonry, the purpose of inverted pentagrams on LDS temples, the use of sacred symbols by the Founding Fathers and more! This film addresses the following questions: Why are some of the sacred symbols used by the Founding Fathers, also found on tapestries in China that date to the time of the flood? Why do we find the same symbols revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, as part of the Restoration, used as well by the early Christians? Are inverted pentagrams occult symbols or do they have a sacred, nearly forgotten meaning? Why are many of the Masonic symbols used by the American Founding Fathers identical to those revealed by Joseph Smith?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/baFHsCe5PBKQToaD20XjmKk4IK8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Statesmen & Symbols: Prelude to the Restoration","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3685616","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2199,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/baFHsCe5PBKQToaD20XjmKk4IK8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
