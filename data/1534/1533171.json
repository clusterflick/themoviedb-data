The film’s main character is a professor of geology, who works on his speech in honor of the anniversary celebrations. He describes the university in the days before the establishment of the state, describing the close connection between scientific research and the development of the country – such as finding water sources or treating malaria. The second part of the film deals with the War of Independence, the abandonment of the Mount Scopus campus, and the finding of alternatives, while in all these the ambition to continue the tradition of learning and teaching is preserved.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House on the Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1950-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
