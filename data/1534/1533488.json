The title refers to William Wordsworth’s poem “Prelude”, in which “spots of time” are defined as events that are important for personal growth. These “moments of insight”, remembered in a state of calm and as if re-experienced, are sources of creative power and imagination. The discovery of old film and photographic films on the sand of the coastline of the Gulf of Azov becomes such a moment for the filmmakers. Over the course of 20 years, they return again and again to the places where their discovery was made, and discover a strange world that covers a kilometer of coastline and an hour and a half of screen time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Место встречи","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Mesto vstrechi","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1825319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Basov","original_name":"Mikhail Basov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yJgLEyeWqvtxySlvncGUiYMHbJC.jpg","credit_id":"68a720a29744050159d5506c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOKer Moscow International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
