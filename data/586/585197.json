The champagne and conversation awkwardly flows with convention, as horrific torture takes place over a painfully broken piano in a secret room on the 9th floor. Who is the tortured? Who is the brutal torturer, and why is this taking place beneath the surreal soiree full of culprits? Only one person knows the answers and finding that soul could unearth a more sinister and disturbing truth than any of the guests are willing to accept.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/k4g9pXqoAmTfdhc99gBxh6KzvYx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An insane portrait of a 'metaphoric game of Cluedo' that will tear out your soul and throw it into a pool of cool jazz.","title":"The 9th","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k4g9pXqoAmTfdhc99gBxh6KzvYx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":710}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
