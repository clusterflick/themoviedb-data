With a producer who stole money from his mother's retirement account to fund the film, to a director who thinks she's the next Francois Truffaut, to an actor/editor who is a doormat for everyone, this motley crew of misfit filmmakers have a tough time navigating the chaotic world of the Sundance Film Festival. Ignorance, foolishness and above all ego drive the team to implosion as they struggle to realize their filmmaking dreams.","popularity":0.1707,"poster_path":"/pezZmjcviPwPHLMmcrvY3lKAnt5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Corner of Ego and Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1571407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonja O'Hara","original_name":"Sonja O'Hara","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/3L9TWNVH1UK6SG2fxnlG8QVuf7N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"5c79a7950e0a2611e71016fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Alicea","original_name":"Rob Alicea","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"5c79a7ac0e0a2611ec103b6b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Ferrari","original_name":"Alex Ferrari","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c79a7cdc3a36844d119d54c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8140328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pezZmjcviPwPHLMmcrvY3lKAnt5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
