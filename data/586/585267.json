Follows the stories of Harrison, Noel, and Chris as they return home from San Quentin State Prison. After spending most of their lives incarcerated, they are forced to reconcile their perception of themselves with a reality they are unprepared for. Each struggles to overcome personal demons and reconstruct their fractured lives. Grappling with day-to-day challenges and striving for success, they work to reconnect with family and provide for themselves for the first time in their adult lives. Told in an unadorned vérité style, we experience the truth of their heartaches and triumphs. As their stories unfold over weeks, months and years, the precarious nature of freedom after incarceration in America is revealed.","popularity":0.2942,"poster_path":"/7fSvtuN7EhCfIhaAljdgyh3RdRX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Personal Stories of Adjusting to Life After Incarceration","title":"Life After Life","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Perkins","original_name":"Tamara Perkins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7797350e0a2607ee62999a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Perkins","original_name":"Tamara Perkins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c856819c3a3687f84d14d7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jesse Dana","original_name":"Jesse Dana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8568329251417ad21678b4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jesse Dana","original_name":"Jesse Dana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c85683d92514129191ce9f7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262253,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kevin Jones","original_name":"Kevin Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8568ebc3a3684e8fdd79a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Rodvien","original_name":"Brian Rodvien","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c856926c3a3685f88d295c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Perkins","original_name":"Philip Perkins","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c856938c3a3684e8fdd7a82","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262259,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shirley Wen","original_name":"Shirley Wen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8569490e0a26699959eacc","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4177268","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"lifeafter.docfilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7fSvtuN7EhCfIhaAljdgyh3RdRX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":15232,"name":"parole"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LIfe After Life Official Trailer","key":"Il1qM71qjOc","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-07-17T21:13:29.000Z","id":"5c8569df0e0a26430165c36d"}]}}}
