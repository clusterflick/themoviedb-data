A blizzard of 1950s and 1960s archival material -- such as television commercials, news broadcasts and comic book pages -- is presented as a way of illustrating the pretensions of what the filmmakers feel was a decadent era. A chronicle of the many and fleeting mid-20th-century American fads and trends is juxtaposed against society's attitude toward the different and unusual.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vr8LrlOczZnvrUMTyKKl3rPCd36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Neon Palace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0230572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.571,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vr8LrlOczZnvrUMTyKKl3rPCd36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":922}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
