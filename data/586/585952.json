Pike, one of handful of officers who know where the allies will strike, is a professional who the Nazis know will never succumb to torture. They hatch a diabolical plan to deceive him into thinking that the war is over and he's recuperating from memory loss in a US hospital in Germany. His doctor (John Glover) and nurse (Joanna Pacula) head an elite Nazi psychological team that attempt to convince Pike into revealing the top secret. But as time slips away, Pike's captors decide he must reach his BREAKING POINT... or die.","popularity":2.2552,"poster_path":"/4Dka671XRQbhrJ0qTG60sv4WEiX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":678,"logo_path":"/AbIc38dGx4b8dhKS7oeRL6aXFDv.png","name":"Turner Network Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some Men Are Prisoners Of War.
