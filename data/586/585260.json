It perfectly captures the glittering never-land of rococco Vienna the way the Viennese—and the rest of the world—wish it had been, and it’s the ideal setting for an adult comedy of love and errors. Susan Graham is the aristocratic young Octavian, torn between two women: Renée Fleming as the Marschallin, the mature woman who understands that one day Octavian must leave her; and Christine Schäfer as Sophie, the young girl who unexpectedly captures his heart. Kristinn Sigmundsson is the lecherous Baron Ochs who sets the whirling plot in motion, and Edo de Waart conducts.","popularity":0.3186,"poster_path":"/4kTUTrhP2PypobFSvOcJg5WTxal.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
