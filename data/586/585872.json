The Italian baritone brings a powerful, versatile voice to his role, but also brings his character a hilarious buffo quality. Daniele Gatti, one of the most acclaimed opera conductors working today, leads a stunning cast of singers including Barbara Fritolli as Alice Ford.  Genuinely warm italianita in all of the music-making, combined with a boisterous production by stage director Sven-Eric Bechtolf, turns Verdis commedia lirica into a fireworks display of high spirits as well as what the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung called musically and dramaturgically a feast of life and of love of life.","popularity":0.1251,"poster_path":"/mUioqImaZskdxDeAfFDf9aEW4yB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falstaff (Zurich)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":491173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Frittoli","original_name":"Barbara Frittoli","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":"/inIt1co2ptKcjAGccX1MUGaxfnp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7ba9f4925141634c49d6ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Cavalletti","original_name":"Massimo Cavalletti","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/oXH2QaCWZHIwrTxrsXSqsge9wMW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7ba9fb0e0a26521c13808e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1610768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Liebau","original_name":"Eva Liebau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c7baa020e0a263ee11130ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ambrogio Maestri","original_name":"Ambrogio Maestri","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/3gyGJr9IENhd5UVMYOFng18QLi8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Falstaff","credit_id":"66fa9b0a703e24dc7c1331b5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Gatti","original_name":"Daniele Gatti","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":"/9tc0hUAeydU0oMpY6UlRnNEYOsG.jpg","credit_id":"5c7baa3092514156ae47611a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven-Eric Bechtolf","original_name":"Sven-Eric Bechtolf","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/lx37jk4NPeaGHFqrvYyyiwVQ1SG.jpg","credit_id":"5c7baa5a925141634c49d755","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Breisach","original_name":"Felix Breisach","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/cg2Htu3AOmFp61XSKBOcycoXgIr.jpg","credit_id":"66fa9d2a807cd51c17f18dcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"66fa9d317054006f60d00c7f","department":"Writing","job":"Opera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"66fa9d3d391013efab1333e0","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21235266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mUioqImaZskdxDeAfFDf9aEW4yB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
