In a vietnamese restaurant set, between 1956, when French troops left Saigon, and 1996, when a return to the native country becomes possible again, destinies of characters who all have a common link with the city intertwine and the ghosts of Saigon in 1956 rub shoulders with exiles from the 13th arrondissement of Paris and their descendants, from whom we desperately tried to hide their wounds and regrets. They sing, dance, eat, and remember, through tears or smiles, those who are absent and the life before.  The theatrical performances of the 15th and 16th octobre 2022 in Sceaux (parisian suburbs) have been filmed, thus proposing to experience the play through the film form.","popularity":0.0456,"poster_path":"/gLowmA36VSJxCR4rHu3LoMakFIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207877,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Hommes Approximatifs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saigon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Guiela Nguyen","original_name":"Caroline Guiela Nguyen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j1RCbkq7kl98SoophFInoJPv0s5.jpg","credit_id":"64f7294d8e20c50cd7f381fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Guiela Nguyen","original_name":"Caroline Guiela Nguyen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j1RCbkq7kl98SoophFInoJPv0s5.jpg","credit_id":"64f72930f29d6635654605a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tPuq4uBxCehO5QZRPaCin5kAWJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLowmA36VSJxCR4rHu3LoMakFIk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1320}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
