The original Carmilla is a story about a young vampire who falls in love with the young woman who unwittingly takes her in after a carriage \"accident\". Bind Over Thee puts the power back in the victim's hands and gives her a choice. It asks subtle questions about innocence and identity, and wonders who is truly more dangerous: the vampire who falls in love, or the lonely girl who offers her a place to stay for the night.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":"/lNOrEP3XzpbX3YzGgSIWLflD1Jh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bind Over Thee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Sorge","original_name":"Luke Sorge","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nfSERchB8fIXn9r1UGtIUiDkT1c.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64f782c3ffc9de00fe3e9d53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4255498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrey Kurtz","original_name":"Audrey Kurtz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64f782d3ffc9de00fe3e9d64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4255499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Fergesen","original_name":"Hannah Fergesen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f782e15f2b8d0139cfcba3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2663804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benjamin Garst","original_name":"Benjamin Garst","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xbGyYbLXPjiQAeFM2BQaDgFcgPO.jpg","credit_id":"64f782ecffc9de00e132ec7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4255499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Fergesen","original_name":"Hannah Fergesen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f782f64ccc5000fe7da918","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lNOrEP3XzpbX3YzGgSIWLflD1Jh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
