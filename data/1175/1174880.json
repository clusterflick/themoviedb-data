The essay film \"Orlando or a short history of the middle class\" is based on a text written by Daniela Dröscher, inspired by Virginia Woolf's dazzling novel heroine Orlando, a character who experiences both social decline and advancement over three centuries and changes gender in between. The film follows Orlando and tells the story of the middle class from a female perspective.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orlando - or a little history of the middle class","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4257434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jelena Jeremejewa","original_name":"Jelena Jeremejewa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8c612e0ca7f014f6d6f20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4257435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catalina Florez","original_name":"Catalina Florez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8c6234ccc5018664b4e99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360667,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniela Dröscher","original_name":"Daniela Dröscher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548ffcf532acb00accb42c5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4257435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catalina Florez","original_name":"Catalina Florez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548ffd6d55c3d00c5bf8276","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4257434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jelena Jeremejewa","original_name":"Jelena Jeremejewa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6548ffde43494f011ec7686d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29606745","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r4rctD1RPCIS0VAUAWLz3e9R85p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
