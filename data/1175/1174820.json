Without further ado, they invite Leon's parents Viktor (Maximilian Grill) and Monika Popow (Josefine Preuss) to their spacious architect-designed house for dinner. While the rich Fabers are still thinking about a considerate, understated style of clothing, Viktor and the cashier Monika arrive on their motorbikes already dressed up - in a fighting mood. The evening takes an unpredictable course with increasing dynamics and in view of the adolescent behavior of the unleashed parents.","popularity":0.4762,"poster_path":"/uCRLMnSfCXWAnM6LQrqrHPHlqxs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gäste
