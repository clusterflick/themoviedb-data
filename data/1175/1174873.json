Born to working parents in 1895, Bigbeeâ€™s life as a multi-sport athlete, a baseball star with the Pittsburgh Pirates, a World War I enlistee, and a World Series hero, intersected with America's Progressive Era, the electrification of society, the First World War, and the onset of the Great Depression. His story, from hitting the decisive run in the 1925 World Series to managing in the American Girls Professional Baseball League, is a poignant reflection of ambition, patriotism, and the resilient spirit of an ever-changing nation in the early 20th Century.","popularity":0.1987,"poster_path":"/deA5w32B0KwUOfVVYuJBXRJ2ZuV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the whirlwind of early 20th Century America, Carson Bigbee's rise from rural Oregon to World Series hero with the Pittsburgh Pirates embodies the ambition, resilience, and transformation of a nation on the brink of modernity.","title":"Carson Bigbee: The Pirate of America's Pastime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4257376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Elevenlabs","original_name":"Rachel Elevenlabs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rachel Elevenlabs","credit_id":"64f8bd6c33a37600c478983e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4257377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Postel","original_name":"Charles Postel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Charles Postel","credit_id":"64f8bd7b4ccc5018664b4b38","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Barbarino","original_name":"Robert Barbarino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bd8833a37600fe618923","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298796,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Getz","original_name":"Trevor Getz","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bdb4ffc9de00fe3f2445","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4187781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Birdy Wei-Ting Hung","original_name":"Birdy Wei-Ting Hung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bdc35f2b8d00abcc9205","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bdf033a37600c4789860","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Barbarino","original_name":"Robert Barbarino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bd99a84a47013a419276","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665337,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joshua Cardenas","original_name":"Joshua Cardenas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8be15a84a4700ad372022","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bde5ffc9de011be982fc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Barbarino","original_name":"Robert Barbarino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8bd8ea84a4700c6a67488","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221001,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isaac Billanfante","original_name":"Isaac Billanfante","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8be004ccc5018664b4b5a","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant \"A\" Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
