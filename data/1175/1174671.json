İbrahim’s only son İsmail, in his late forties, is doing his compulsory military service in this region and has 20 days left until his military service ends. Under these conditions, İbrahim, an asthmatic, lives in an old, dilapidated village house with his father İsmail. While he is dealing with a wild animal that is haunting his chickens and eggs, his only source of income, he also wants to hospitalize his father for treatment. Lack of money has caused a rift between him and his wife, and has left him unable to even buy a school notebook for his daughter.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":"/7PiA7eK97wZ2p078N4QoBZa0trk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2023-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacrifice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mürşit Ağa Bağ","original_name":"Mürşit Ağa Bağ","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/rRutBhh2RiVHSiHtwEDWw0Trfz1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64f83ad8e0ca7f00ae3c16c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2064664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuat Onan","original_name":"Fuat Onan","popularity":0.1382,"profile_path":"/cF0sTnPG7bGBLYrQ3qFHXRCgYq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64f83adea8b2ca011b896e24","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nermin Yılmaz","original_name":"Nermin Yılmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64f83ae45f2b8d00e12db44c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ümit Çırak","original_name":"Ümit Çırak","popularity":0.1673,"profile_path":"/uoux9LgLlTUzhD2IvfgkbUrqIdO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6705ee9044265c4359780d75","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merve Uslu","original_name":"Merve Uslu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6705ee9ea88614d6b08ac3a0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4989699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdulselam Toğ","original_name":"Abdulselam Toğ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6705eea344265c4359780d81","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2632652,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vedat Oyan","original_name":"Vedat Oyan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f83abc4ccc501865b210d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256507,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Hakan Özdil","original_name":"Hakan Özdil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f83acae0ca7f00cbe77205","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aynur Güneş","original_name":"Aynur Güneş","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f83ad0a8b2ca011b896e1c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603644,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mevlüt Koçak","original_name":"Mevlüt Koçak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f83ac2a8b2ca00fedd68a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"İsmail Güneş","original_name":"İsmail Güneş","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f83aae8e20c50cd62a3497","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"İsmail Güneş","original_name":"İsmail Güneş","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f83ab48e20c50cd4224b31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwJeo9MbZqffOlNKq1BZ2a8JmTv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jy6LiOo6ClUveqSneTN4memZmXx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iCiPKQh4TOpLt3INujOhdzU2xO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1241,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7PiA7eK97wZ2p078N4QoBZa0trk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"International Crime & Punishment Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
