Constructed using primary source documents about the taking of Zhoushan, Britain's first choice for a seaport, in the late 1830s,this movie uses Captain Charles Elliot's reluctance to brutalize the Chinese to reflect on the cyclical nature of history and the power structures that move it. The long takes used throughout function to illustrate the dramatically different ways in which people who lived in the mid-19th century perceived time. Additionally, it represents the psychological effect of living on an island regardless of what era you were born in.The last third of the movie focuses on a young woman whose strange day job has taken her far away from the island of Zhoushan generations after Captain Charles Elliot was last there. \"Captain Elliot's Circle\" was shot on location in Zhoushan and Hangzhou.","popularity":1.5191,"poster_path":"/2kuxAegiBO9BLDgYK46yTnHsv6h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2023-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captain Elliot's Circle","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Zhang","original_name":"Iris Zhang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Iris","credit_id":"64f84e2aa8b2ca01384b088c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Bull-Beddows","original_name":"Ryan Bull-Beddows","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Historical Narrator","credit_id":"64f84e578e20c50cd4225427","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emer Cordoba","original_name":"Emer Cordoba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Man on Phone","credit_id":"64f84e735f2b8d00fef5bcee","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1719575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Barningham","original_name":"Jake Barningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gxFh3V8nTIiAOrmS9TaJGkkgOyj.jpg","credit_id":"64f84e01ffc9de0138ea92f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4256600,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"SLF","original_name":"SLF","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f84e9ea8b2ca011b8977fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1719575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Barningham","original_name":"Jake Barningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gxFh3V8nTIiAOrmS9TaJGkkgOyj.jpg","credit_id":"64f853b94ccc501865b21d3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1596,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2kuxAegiBO9BLDgYK46yTnHsv6h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1632,"name":"opium"},{"id":8250,"name":"victorian england"},{"id":159862,"name":"british history"},{"id":169620,"name":"correspondence"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":226475,"name":"naval battle"},{"id":252596,"name":"victorian era"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":289928,"name":"chinese history"},{"id":322511,"name":"opium wars"},{"id":322512,"name":"zhoushan"},{"id":322513,"name":"boats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER | Captain Elliot's Circle (2023)","key":"RaKaTV_Bic4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-26T10:23:52.000Z","id":"64f855355f2b8d00e12dc0f5"}]}}}
