They reject the state and want to make their own laws. Right-wing militias such as the North Idaho Militia have been active in the region for a long time. Together with the ultraconservatives, they are fighting against a multicultural America and for a new white and Christian colony, separate from the rest of the United States. But the sparsely populated countryside attracts not only radicals, but also more and more middle-class families from the cities. They are excited by the spectacular scenery and the low cost of living. And they want their children to grow up in a supposedly perfect world.","popularity":0.3534,"poster_path":"/5AZrNOuQP08XXe6rtkABjsKXTc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206560,"logo_path":null,"name":"VAT & Cie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"USA Extrem: Idaho – Cowboys und Milizen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Radikale in Idaho: Amerikas neuer Wilder Westen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Adams","original_name":"Frank Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73da78e20c50cd3ed4c5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Surplus","original_name":"Brett Surplus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73dd0f29d663564eb4107","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4254986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Birdsong","original_name":"Michael Birdsong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73e2ca8b2ca00c4aca553","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3556049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Ellis","original_name":"Jennifer Ellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73e7f8e20c50cd843639b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Shea","original_name":"Matthew Shea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73e9df29d663565460d75","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clyde Tinley","original_name":"Clyde Tinley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73ec4a8b2ca01384a9a3a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozzie Knezovich","original_name":"Ozzie Knezovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f73eeff29d663565460d98","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Grabli","original_name":"Gary Grabli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f73c335f2b8d00e12d51c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tâm Melacca","original_name":"Tâm Melacca","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f73c2bffc9de00e132dc00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Grabli","original_name":"Gary Grabli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f73c38e0ca7f00ae3bb90c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1958698,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Damien Pasinetti","original_name":"Damien Pasinetti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f73c428e20c50cd7f38885","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":860,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5AZrNOuQP08XXe6rtkABjsKXTc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":573},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":831,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6WBGUqSTz09gcyWzw47vDlsOf9M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1550,"name":"militia"},{"id":2347,"name":"idaho"},{"id":11529,"name":"conservatism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ZDFinfo","release_date":"2023-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
