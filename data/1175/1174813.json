Many of the workers are undocumented, and attempting to keep their jobs even as federal migration crackdowns hover over the town.  The Fields of Immokalee film follows the daily lives of tomato workers, from the 5:00am trips to the parking lot in hopes of finding day labor, to work sessions in the scorching mid-day heat, to child detention centers for migrant youth that have been separated from their families. Via these vignettes, the film offers insight into the most volatile political issue of our time.","popularity":0.4769,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fields of Immokalee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4042501,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irene Braam","original_name":"Irene Braam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8926ba8b2ca00c4ad3306","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4042500,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Cook","original_name":"Jeff Cook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8927be0ca7f010de6fb5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3539305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel George","original_name":"Samuel George","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8924633a376013817f453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8QZKo1wGq00UlsCvCKkyAoKObXv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12423,"name":"undocumented immigrant"},{"id":154846,"name":"farmer"},{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":214744,"name":"worker's rights"},{"id":218161,"name":"working immigrants"},{"id":252731,"name":"undocumented worker"},{"id":309949,"name":"workers"},{"id":322542,"name":"farmers rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
