They risked their lives for king and empire, but their contribution has largely been forgotten.  Some of the last surviving Caribbean veterans tell their extraordinary wartime stories - from torpedo attacks by German U-boats and the RAF's blanket-bombing of Germany to the culture shock of Britain's freezing winters and war-torn landscapes. This brave sacrifice confronted the pioneers from the Caribbean with a lifelong challenge - to be treated as equals by the British government and the British people. With vivid first-hand testimony, observational documentary and rare archive footage, the programme gives a unique perspective on the Second World War and the history of 20th-century Britain.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":"/HHVKzAA9MdeygPmJT5TNiAqQMV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting for King and Empire: Britain's Caribbean Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1997095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Olusoga","original_name":"David Olusoga","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/bPyLm3drGDZ3ofdHmWWCtpo3tky.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64f7ab2c1b722c011dcd6daa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"sam martinez","original_name":"sam martinez","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d6c9102441820164aef107","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Brown","original_name":"Victor Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self(as Victor Emanuel Brown)","credit_id":"65d6c955b04605017b0a2fe1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Granlund","original_name":"Chris Granlund","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f7ab51a8b2ca00ac89a9a5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4255718,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Wadsworth","original_name":"Marc Wadsworth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f7ab71e0ca7f00ec89890b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4255720,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Hobson","original_name":"Deborah Hobson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f7ab88a8b2ca00fedd17b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Cottingham","original_name":"Matt Cottingham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f7aba1e0ca7f00ec898915","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Cottingham","original_name":"Matt Cottingham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f7abade0ca7f00ec89891e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Crichton","original_name":"Ben Crichton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d6c8d65ca704017c0ec757","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5115508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/HHVKzAA9MdeygPmJT5TNiAqQMV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
