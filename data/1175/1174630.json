Two powerful companies, headed by the billionaires Ringdal and Duk, compete for the right to own the machine. Ringdal wins. Kurtniz gets the billionaire’s daughter and a lot of money for the machine. The communist Jacob Miller calls workers fired by Ringdal to strike. Next to Jacob is the female worker Maika Kork.  Workers want to destroy Kurtniz’s machine. The struggle is exacerbated when the second machine appears. It is even more sophisticated and threatens to put thousands of people out for work.  This new machine is invented by the engineer Rebeck, a long-time competitor of Kurtniz both in the professional and personal life. This time, Rebeck receives a share of income and… Emilia, as Ringdal’s daughter abandons the looser Kurtniz. Workers declare a general strike which turns into an armed insurrection.","popularity":0.0675,"poster_path":"/9IYVcNwKFUcJ9JaidZayJgo4MsE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1926-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Struggle of the Giants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Машина двох світів","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Two Worlds Machine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Turin","original_name":"Victor Turin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/iu4F3DdxbSpOyC9RB33nYHMMkUd.jpg","credit_id":"64f82afbe0ca7f012eb5741a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1910418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Solomon Lazurin","original_name":"Solomon Lazurin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f8306f4ccc5018664b1451","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1910418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Solomon Lazurin","original_name":"Solomon Lazurin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f830865f2b8d00fef5afa4","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":11634,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Scharfenberg","original_name":"Robert Scharfenberg","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f830da4ccc5018664b148c","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342821,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Louis Forestier","original_name":"Louis Forestier","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702759b67c6fb09fff87a3e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21830910","wikidata_id":"Q109428715","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8po2815tq14P3ExacCKV5FEc5t.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1052,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/9IYVcNwKFUcJ9JaidZayJgo4MsE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":702},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1052,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/6D1bASyKfrBSQk2U4YU7PjS3WVz.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":702},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1201,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/fdO87a3uDCMX1ns1U7dfTdNUfei.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv","release_date":"1926-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" Moscow","release_date":"1927-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Боротьба велетнів (1926, реж  Віктор Турін, фрагмент)","key":"gtapgUS_eeU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-02T10:27:38.000Z","id":"64f9e172db4ed600ac3c2be1"}]}}}
