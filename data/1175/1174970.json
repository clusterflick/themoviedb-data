Many associations emerge as we hear the tale in relation to this image and its shifting background. . . including a bicycle being ridden by the filmmaker, spools and spokes, a feeling of a metal insect or iridescent whirring dragonfly picking up the passing colours. There is a still centre to the radial motion against linear road or landscape. A feeling of cyclical storytelling comes with the account of her own life and giving birth to a ‘computer literate and perfectly bilingual’ baby daughter. We are led to respond to her not being guaranteed to stay in control. Again multiple strands are knotted in this fortune wheel: gain on the swings, lose on roundabouts, with no ‘perfection’ in relations with other beings on the round of merry, or social, or just plain recurring intercourse. -Sandra Lahire","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/mNmZuXC97nTaeAdBINflaLxkttt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tale Part Told","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1302686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Turner","original_name":"Sarah Turner","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f904dd4ccc501865b25020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mNmZuXC97nTaeAdBINflaLxkttt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
