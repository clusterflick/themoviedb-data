The poem is an LGBTQ+ story involving two men, beginning in the 1970s, and it describes, through the use of vignettes, how their love has aged and grown. It captures the heart of their relationship at different ages and time periods. The way it felt, the things they did together, what the relationship truly meant to them.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/81zlXQF2p2q3O2fcCzeQvJChCFZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tender expression of what love looks like as it ages.","title":"This Is a Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Bolden","original_name":"Ken Bolden","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/aLfm6oVVcMZzvkquFi9SNRmygH8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6534b9248cfcc700e96a3e43","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James FitzGerald","original_name":"James FitzGerald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6534b962c8a5ac00c509fac3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Meyers","original_name":"Dylan Meyers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6534b982c8a5ac00fffa0038","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706283,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Connor McNelis","original_name":"Connor McNelis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6534b98ac8a5ac0139aabeb2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3994691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah J.
