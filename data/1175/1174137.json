The return to their communities proves as formidable a battle as the more literal firefights of previous months. Living among loved ones who don't yet understand them and how they have changed, contending with a media focused on the politics rather than the human experience of war, and suffering from a psychological disorder that is difficult to acknowledge, these young veterans grapple to find purpose and healing.","popularity":0.2389,"poster_path":"/kt8U9JoQsA4Ssen7oCHzDLEBwRx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207851,"logo_path":null,"name":"MirrorLake Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The hardest battles are fought at home.","title":"Reserved to Fight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Simmons","original_name":"Earl Simmons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f696f4e0ca7f00ec892ee6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Nibley","original_name":"Christopher Nibley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f6972ee0ca7f00cbe6dbc5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Jemmett","original_name":"Matthew Jemmett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f6974e5f2b8d00fef5182c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4254176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Patterson","original_name":"Mark Patterson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64f6976a5f2b8d00e12d0d8e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2109849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantelle Squires","original_name":"Chantelle Squires","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f69623ac4161012070677f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336235,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Genéa Gaudet","original_name":"Genéa Gaudet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f69b3212197e00c44979e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Cardon","original_name":"Sam Cardon","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/2mHqc0ynjDkms0uutrx1Rry6yH5.jpg","credit_id":"64f69b5b8e20c50cd7f345df","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463527,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tim Johnson","original_name":"Tim Johnson","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f69c8fac416100e132837a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0923873","wikidata_id":"Q7315293","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pQcfbfG7XGpwiCRTxPXwugrfuah.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kt8U9JoQsA4Ssen7oCHzDLEBwRx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New York City Short Film Festival","release_date":"2005-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SouthSide Film Festival","release_date":"2008-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Reserved To Fight PBS Trailer","key":"XLUg-B0nPzI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2008-10-11T21:01:33.000Z","id":"64f69664e0ca7f00ec892e85"}]}}}
