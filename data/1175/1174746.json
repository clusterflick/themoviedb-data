The secret to the seaman's success is \"location, location, location,\" and with this new collection, you'll travel with Popeye and crew into outer space, all around the globe and under the sea! Continuing the chronological theatrical releases, this set covers the years 1946 and 1947. Popeye not only rockets to Mars, he explores the ocean deep, becomes a cowboy out West, fights pirates on the high seas and tackles wild game in Africa. He and his lady love, Olive Oyl, also find romance (and usually a Bluto-like rival) while traveling back to medieval times or exploring the fictional Middle Easter city of Badgag, as well as climbing mountain peaks in the frozen Klondike. This is classic animation at its finest - featuring zany cartoon action from the pen of veteran Jim Tyer and powerfully dynamic direction from animation legend Bill Tytla.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/nKgRwKYD0tLB7DcyCgig7693DNS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Popeye The Sailor: The 1940s Volume 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKgRwKYD0tLB7DcyCgig7693DNS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1043}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
