The muleteers, fishermen and artisanal miners that make up the canyon culture refer to the Cauca River as Patron Mono (Blonde Boss), both for its yellow color and for the gold found in its waters and sands. For them, it is the best employer in the world because it does not set schedules and never refuses to pay, that is, it always provides them with fish and gold. The images that make up the triptych of projections are shots from gold artisanally from the Cauca River, as well as shots filmed in the same canyon.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patron Mono","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2697013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Caycedo","original_name":"Carolina Caycedo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6327602324f2ce008609a780","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Baltic Gallery exhibition","release_date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
