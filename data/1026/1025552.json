The amputated leg, a phantom limb that he can still move in his mind, is the pivotal point of this story. At the same time a trace of the war that made him lose most of his family members and forced him to flee his country, at the same time a brake on his exodus that made walking painful and more laborious than any of his fellow travelers, it is also the fulcrum for his integration into a new territory.","popularity":0.2094,"poster_path":"/59gefZBmXQ11ZaLyicYORQafozm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209079,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAJINE STUDIO","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zou","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925927,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yannig Willmann","original_name":"Yannig Willmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650acc7681c7be00adfef2db","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079705,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie Bottois","original_name":"Marie Bottois","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650acc2781c7be011d76e32d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359308,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yannick Delmaire","original_name":"Yannick Delmaire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650acc5faede59011be86394","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281031,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Blandine Briere","original_name":"Blandine Briere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650acca4d6c30000cce12ad7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556085,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonin Dalmasso","original_name":"Antonin Dalmasso","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650acc346c19ea00adec8e6c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2898232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon P.R.
