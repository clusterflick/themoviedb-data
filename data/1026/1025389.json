As they journey downstream, he begins seeing a mysterious boy, Alexander, who appears and disappears in the water. Dídac feels himself changing, drawn toward Alexander and away from his brother Biel. Their mother, Monika, who once took the same trip as a teenager, drifts into memories of a past summer love.
