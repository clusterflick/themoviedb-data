Trash cinema at its best, full of humor, terror and dandruff.  After discovering that the director of \"Devil Dead\" (the Indian copy of \"Infernal Possession\") abandoned the authentic Necronomicon in the town of Vic, Bastián, Hans and Juanillo (three unemployed farmhands) begin a journey to find the book cursed to achieve his long-awaited dream of being successful Youtubers. An adventure that will bring them face to face with unpleasant creatures from the underworld.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zpgUftlhkzjAZ6YlHEpszodkh7j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Terror, Comedy","title":"Devil Dead 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/zpgUftlhkzjAZ6YlHEpszodkh7j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
