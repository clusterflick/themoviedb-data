Dead As A Dodo lays bare the settler colonial mythology at the heart of the  popular narrative of the Dodo’s extinction, drawing on archival material and in conversation with a book of poems titled A Theory of Birds by the Palestinian-American  poet Zaina Alsous. Lines from this collection and a zoological study of the Dodo (1848) have  been collaged into a cento to narrate the fictions (of race, name, and value) that enshrine settler  colonial imaginaria over and above living in “co-dignity” with the land.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/r8BSATj0Nt8V3kEQUULpd7tAmxE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"2022-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead as a Dodo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3705215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leena Habiballa","original_name":"Leena Habiballa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6326a5cfcba36f00910e0404","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r8BSATj0Nt8V3kEQUULpd7tAmxE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
