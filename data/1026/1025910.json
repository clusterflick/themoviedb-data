After surviving the devastation of the Blitzkrieg, Karski swears allegiance to the Polish Underground and risks his life to carry the first eyewitness reports of war-torn Poland to the Western world, and ultimately, the Oval Office. Escaping a Gestapo prison, bearing witness to the despair of the Warsaw ghetto and confronted by the inhumanity of a death camp, Karski endures unspeakable mental anguish and physical torture to stand tall in the halls of power and speak the truth.","popularity":0.1521,"poster_path":"/piVQua4LqtVVtc1VCgzn1DCU62r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of a man who told of humanity's greatest crimes while there was still time to stop them.","title":"Remember This","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Strathairn","original_name":"David Strathairn","popularity":1.1335,"profile_path":"/fhkvTcrCDPTAclTnE7sqQS1NZKq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jan Karski","credit_id":"632749fa24f2ce00902c2559","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706017,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clark Young","original_name":"Clark Young","popularity":0.1177,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a4d20af77007bfca4f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706019,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Anisko","original_name":"Michael Anisko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a6e3bd26e007e7390f2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2891646,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Anisko","original_name":"Eva Anisko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a5aa14e10007bb2fafa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388462,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dan Logan","original_name":"Dan Logan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a7c43250f007b7e4233","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2524540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeff Hutchens","original_name":"Jeff Hutchens","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":"/iGIrFeh9emT3P36iioIgTYZ7mRS.jpg","credit_id":"63274a0ab18f320083df16b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2891646,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Anisko","original_name":"Eva Anisko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a61a14e10007e4bfcf2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Goldman","original_name":"Derek Goldman","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a41a67254007addddb1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Goldman","original_name":"Derek Goldman","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63274a2053866e008f052453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13614418","wikidata_id":"Q116189324","facebook_id":"RememberThisKarski","instagram_id":"rememberthiskarskifilm","twitter_id":"karskifilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQ2awLtXygXxXxndoSuMVbjaDVw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/piVQua4LqtVVtc1VCgzn1DCU62r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2022-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"l40gWdpJ_qE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-12-16T19:15:21.000Z","id":"63aebc458741c400e0390cbd"}]}}}
