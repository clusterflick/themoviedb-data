Nearly every musician interviewed talks about experiencing anti-Asian racism while growing up. Bald shows how defensive identification with England's black population led them to embrace reggae and hip-hop in addition to Indian sounds like Bollywood sound track music, bhangra, and Indian classical music. A passing moment of attention from the mainstream media and major record labels has embittered some of the performers but left others more focused and still hopeful.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mutiny: Asians Storm British Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivek Renjen Bald","original_name":"Vivek Renjen Bald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6327762d713ed40081ef5aae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3663520","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival","release_date":"2003-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
