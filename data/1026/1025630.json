Dane introduces Rail to his mother, Violet, a full blood hewise, who remembers the horrors of the Indian schools. Her ex-husband Bedford refuses to give his real name to a white man. Her daughter April broadcasts a tribal blog on indian affairs. Dane and Rail are stopped by local militia types.  Entrepreneurs propose a geothermal plant to ranchers and locals divided by political views.  Rail finds an old map in an abandoned ranch and Mitra, now recovered, rejoins him.
