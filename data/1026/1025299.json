These include agriculture, mining, fisheries, cattle raising, pearling and the like. The Territory is still a land of many challenging problems; its greatest limiting factor being the lack of water. In recent years transportation has been improved  and education approached with vision and imagination. Housing is also being developed. Two thirds of the Territoryâ€™s work force is in Government employ.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/oFioW0BPuPmqYS49TVoym31iNnB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Commonwealth Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living North","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703560,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Richard Mace","original_name":"Richard Mace","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253b227d41aa007dd03366","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703563,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Bowditch","original_name":"Jim Bowditch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253b6c244182007a0186c8","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703564,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alan Seymour","original_name":"Alan Seymour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253b77ae6f09007c16b937","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Howe","original_name":"Neil Howe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253bc2511d09007f4fb069","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Murray","original_name":"Donald Murray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253b995ca704007ecfd037","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703561,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Hughes","original_name":"Robert Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253b60fd4a960091858449","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3424241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Anderson","original_name":"Alan Anderson","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253b3084591c007fc65931","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2592588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Bagnall","original_name":"Frank Bagnall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63253bb2ae6f09007f283e7b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFioW0BPuPmqYS49TVoym31iNnB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Living North","key":"CQJemqqRGfg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-01-25T03:11:09.000Z","id":"63253c0a8c7b0f0079ba6e8f"}]}}}
