The request of a mysterious woman (Robin Reck) to view the videotaped confession of a madman (Angel Connell) sets off fierce gossip among three office clerks (Jeff Corveau, Robert Jodka, and Eric Scheiner) over the nature of the woman's relationship with said madman and the woman's deceased sister (Zenobia). When the woman abruptly leaves the office after listening to the taped confession, she accidentally leaves behind a photograph. When found by the clerks, said photograph hints at further complications suggested by their gossip - including intimations of incest, murder, and necrophilia.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The love that dare not whisper its name is now the talk of the town","title":"She's So Cold","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1701714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Connell","original_name":"Angel Connell","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b4dd1b722c0468998a66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Reck","original_name":"Robin Reck","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/kCmiAJCHoyQBXpI76iYebFVcS7A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b4ec383df200613e1418","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3600486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Jodka","original_name":"Bob Jodka","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b507df294505c8f8665d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3600487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Corveau","original_name":"Jeff Corveau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b51525b95500615f44d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Scheiner","original_name":"Eric Scheiner","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b5959ae61305856cfcca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3600491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zenobia","original_name":"Zenobia","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b5bce7c0970534677512","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3600492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Andreas","original_name":"Mark Andreas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b5d79ae61305856cfcf9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3543084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Connell","original_name":"Jim Connell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b5f9ae366803df75f955","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2981488,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthony DiMarco","original_name":"Anthony DiMarco","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b626a3491100517c3773","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3600494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Fisher","original_name":"Jon Fisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b64b25b95500615f458c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Castalia Jason","original_name":"Castalia Jason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62b5b661383df200613e1520","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1701714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Connell","original_name":"Angel Connell","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b5b4c225b955009216b6e3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1701714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Connell","original_name":"Angel Connell","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b5b4b1ae366803df75f8be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1446494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
