When he died in an accident, he left an irrevocable gap in her life. Twenty years later, young Patrick rescues Christina from a thunderstorm. From the beginning, he reminds her of Jacob, from his friendly and confident nature to his characteristic gestures. The two become lovers. Christina is happy with Patrick, in whom she sees more and more the Jacob she has found again. But the more the two men become one person for Christina, the more irritated Patrick becomes. When he begins to see more than coincidence in their encounter, Christina has disappeared.","popularity":0.3554,"poster_path":"/vFCLK0OwQbGT7VJV3Ragu8AI4qZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lailaps
