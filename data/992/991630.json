In 2000, he began exploring various film formats at l'Etna, an alternative workshop in Paris. He shifts between documentary and fiction formats, bringing to mind the wounds of Lebanese society, displaced beings, the fragmentation of identity. Pulsating scenes and jolting cuts demonstrate his desire to destroy cliches. The shock of the imagery in his feature-length films, made after 2010, bears witness to a penetrating critical eye on Lebanon's cultural shifts and the rupture of meaning.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/IWz4fY1bCkjRbbihO7ZVOLvKll.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinexpérimentaux #10: Christophe Karabache","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Karabache","original_name":"Christophe Karabache","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/y2D16ECVoCnXCS5XyN5Lw4XcEbx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62b59aba9ae613058f1d4146","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédérique Devaux","original_name":"Frédérique Devaux","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/AnE42MyouSJemHvSCu8cc9fCJmB.jpg","credit_id":"62b599dae33f83008b01fee4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Amarger","original_name":"Michel Amarger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b59aa125b95500516572c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/IWz4fY1bCkjRbbihO7ZVOLvKll.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Frédérique Devaux and Michel Armager - Cinexpérimentaux 10: CHRISTOPHE KARABACHE","key":"fHVu-wz5qbU","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-05T15:23:31.000Z","id":"62b59b66e7c09705346763fe"}]}}}
