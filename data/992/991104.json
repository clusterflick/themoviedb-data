Perhaps the last surviving artist of the original Surrealist artist movement, as well as the famously former lover of Max Ernst, Carrington's life and work is arguably not \"surreal\" at all, nor is it classifiable in any sense of the word.  Indebted to Surrealism, Carrington is nonetheless possessed of unique personal visions born from a fantastical interior life, one based in Celtic legend, alchemy, fairy tales, Tibetan Buddhism, Tarot, Kabbala, astrology, Mexican healing traditions and other mystical practices.  This portrait, the first such documentary of her life and work produced in the United States, covers Carrington's entire oeuvre, with footage from the 1940's through 2006, and includes a fanciful dramatization of her famous 1939 short story, \"The Debutante.\"","popularity":0.1489,"poster_path":"/b4efEoKWxlEOmPCsURHnQuwoWUU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flowering of the Crone: Leonora Carrington, Another Reality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonora Carrington","original_name":"Leonora Carrington","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/w5SLOlsxgHCwqgaXbj8pDW5MYq4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"62b3aa8f05f9cf00eee57d84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Chadwick","original_name":"Whitney Chadwick","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"62b3aaca99259c0061df5062","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2420477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ally Acker","original_name":"Ally Acker","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b3aa8299259c0061df504e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1828324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4efEoKWxlEOmPCsURHnQuwoWUU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":176485,"name":"female artist"},{"id":298855,"name":"leonora carrington"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
