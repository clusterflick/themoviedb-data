Textiles still form a powerful part of identity. But this identity is at risk. Indigenous people still face racism on a daily basis. And a globalized market economy that produces cheap, machine-made products destroys respect and interest in the hand-made. Infringement on the intellectual rights of native peoples only makes this worse.The Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco (CTTC) was established by Andean weavers and their supporters to aid in the survival of Cusqueñan textile traditions and to provide support to the indigenous people who create them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cMYcQQ4fdkDky2J7QJMt00EGIA6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Following the Thread","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3601278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Guerra","original_name":"Roberto Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b6920ae1faed0051e32457","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3601273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathy Brew","original_name":"Kathy Brew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b6919ba61de10092faebcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cMYcQQ4fdkDky2J7QJMt00EGIA6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
