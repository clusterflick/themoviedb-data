One night, while having dinner, Nicola lets slip the fact that in school other kids tease him, calling him \"rat\", as rats live in hiding. Carmelo understands this is a crucial moment in his child's growth, and chooses his words wisely. He starts telling Nicola a tale. The tale of the Rat's Angle. That same evening, late at night, Nicola and Carmelo are hiding under the bed, scared. Some men are trying to break into the house, screaming death threats. Carmelo looks at his son, he knows how to calm him down: he reminds him of the rat they talked about at dinner. The hitmen are now in the room. Carmelo closes his eyes, building up courage. He knows this is the last time he will have to. Then he jumps out of hiding.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/j22ENqZaPxt9BIrrfcFQCKMA9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cloverthree","origin_country":""},{"id":177592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prince
