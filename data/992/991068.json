They speak a language of advertising, corporate branding and self-help, while engaging in a battle to control traffic lights. The discovery that the entire social code is embedded in the access code that regulates traffic lights, begins a twisted ride of cultural espionage techniques. These techniques include surveillance cameras and costumes, as they attempt to untangle the social codes of characters caught in an endless rush hour.  The project is a 3D animation using motion capture applied to non-human characters that took five years to produce.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/2L1E8hr7t7GF9IEUrcOWjBFqlmd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Duesing","original_name":"James Duesing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b3884f0257640052767e95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2L1E8hr7t7GF9IEUrcOWjBFqlmd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
