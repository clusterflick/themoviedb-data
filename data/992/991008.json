Unable to convince his boss at his day job to give him time off for an audition, he heads to the casting office anyhow. On his way, a call from his agent informs him—microaggressions included—that the role has been taken and that he needs to present himself better to people. Insulted, he screams at his agent and begins to spiral. Clearly a paycheck away from becoming unhoused and devastated by the state of things, he allows his imagination to offer him a form of respite.","popularity":0.1006,"poster_path":"/hi8c65N5vPK44TTocfxXXUZuWE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regret to Inform You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1822447,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Greist","original_name":"Steve Greist","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62b370a91b7c59054afc8d26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yusuf Nasir","original_name":"Yusuf Nasir","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62b370ada24c50047bd7f7ed","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yusuf Nasir","original_name":"Yusuf Nasir","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b3707db5bc21008b09db97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benji Schwimmer","original_name":"Benji Schwimmer","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/hyqPaJtEZx70CtgsUVzQLDNGqn4.jpg","credit_id":"62b37088b5bc2100610d186d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20454134","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hi8c65N5vPK44TTocfxXXUZuWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
