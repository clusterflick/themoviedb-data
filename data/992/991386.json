Against the backdrop of the momentous collision of two aerobatic planes on \"Open Day\" at the American air base, this film tells the story of four families in fictionalized form - they are visitors to the air show who lost their loved ones in the horrific inferno, and an emergency doctor who cannot forget the sight of the dead and injured. They all suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Years after the disaster, they finally have the opportunity to share their experiences and come to terms with the trauma in a specially founded aftercare group. Meanwhile, a duo of investigators commissioned by the German Federal Ministry investigates the background to the air accident and uncovers massive failures in safety precautions and rescue measures. Beyond political responsibility on both the German and American sides, both come up against a wall of silence.","popularity":0.727,"poster_path":"/hLe4nsaSdz03xg5kS8FLZSlDqKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21931,"logo_path":"/t4LXePf1f6W81RODGtTAWK5DIRt.png","name":"FFP New
