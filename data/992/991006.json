The film’s second half, set during the 18th century’s feudal wars, centers on a folkloric love story between a Vietnamese medicinal healer and a Khmer woman that unfolds around the symbolic significance of a durian (or “thouren”) fruit, a major product of the Mekong Delta.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wQvIEH0t97Qz2Uy7KqdWcgC2qu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Han Nefkens Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2022-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Rain, Brise-Soleil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2064932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thảo Nguyên Phan","original_name":"Thảo Nguyên Phan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m4yuCnd49t2jgB1CtGDgT61yZmW.jpg","credit_id":"62b36e5bc2bcc60064d27d37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQvIEH0t97Qz2Uy7KqdWcgC2qu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tate St Ives","release_date":"2022-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Art Biennale ","release_date":"2022-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
