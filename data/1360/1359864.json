The entire production was done on the train, round trip, between Toronto and Vancouver. Directly inspired by the environment and the experience of travel, the film takes the audience into the cabin where it was made and where one's thoughts can only wander as they follow the winding railways through ever-changing landscapes. It is a contemplative, aesthetic and sensitive film.","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":"/zcEOqYEKYnVSx5CnDtP1VQLkHYj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dérailler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Dalpé","original_name":"Marielle Dalpé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef804992d39685383b49e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Dalpé","original_name":"Marielle Dalpé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef805a4a7f0b18b0263678","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Dalpé","original_name":"Marielle Dalpé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef807b4a7f0b18b0263682","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888980,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Noël","original_name":"Christine Noël","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef80a16c3b7a8d648d5889","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zcEOqYEKYnVSx5CnDtP1VQLkHYj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9pS9vL6Wtkh2XAyoASTOW6ZeygP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival du Nouveau Cinéma","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
