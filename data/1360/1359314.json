This poignant narrative exposes the cold reality many immigrants and refugees from non-white countries face in Europe, while also revealing how our protagonist finds solace in a new community. The unique soundtrack, crafted entirely from the sounds of his surroundings—such as cooking noises, waves, and city ambiance—adds an authentic layer to this compelling story. \"MY OWN\" offers a fresh and immersive take on the resilience of the human spirit.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2kf6qZqCuDSTUXMskXAjCkP3uWt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MY
