She has left her parents' home and is supposed to attend university, but she never goes. She has a few specific obsessions: the passing of time, cocaine, and Angelica. Since they started living together, everything seems to move faster, spiraling downwards. Even their friendship stumbles into addiction and becomes confused with love. Bianca keeps a notebook, jotting down notes for her books. Still, she wishes she could write everything in it: that youth is painful and already slipping away, that friendship breaks your heart, and that we constantly lose everything — and yet, maybe, in the end — between the night streets of Rome, the boys of Naples, and the tree that stands silently, visible through the window — nothing will be truly lost.","popularity":0.1832,"poster_path":"/mPYYqTZ3dxvPcS48ljyQQAM7HsX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6275,"logo_path":"/ynsdOyF03HZvEeZreVrDLc3OPEc.png","name":"BiBi Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'albero","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2865221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tecla Insolia","original_name":"Tecla Insolia","popularity":0.8207,"profile_path":"/jKZBvFvHjcR7ljdnSlkNJKKTRh5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66ed7e4682f5618d90adeb30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3014985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlotta Gamba","original_name":"Carlotta Gamba","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/lDPUcEdQMprkz2E3DjvcaiIAszz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66ed7e4d2dcb758bbfadcca7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1880581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Pellegrino","original_name":"Cristina Pellegrino","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/kkO4IUMiibEa4BtkCTQaEfP3WuP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66ed7e5582f5618d90adeb3c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4953323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Petraglia","original_name":"Sara Petraglia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ed7e7e2dcb758bbfadccc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4953323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Petraglia","original_name":"Sara Petraglia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef387ba82b00570326170e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3963050,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sabrina Varani","original_name":"Sabrina Varani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef388fc237258e4c26094f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755319,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Desideria Rayner","original_name":"Desideria Rayner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef389c0ea80d1fe38d4389","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Merlino","original_name":"Martina Merlino","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef38ac0ea80d1fe38d4396","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Angelo Barbagallo","original_name":"Angelo Barbagallo","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/gabEAlNXvupXuZicSv7yBtaI2pH.jpg","credit_id":"66ef38e16fd7cc7d423b2f4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matilde Barbagallo","original_name":"Matilde Barbagallo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef38eba82b005703261735","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31421328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o9O70CGl9e4Z2rYdK72d69QtB2R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/mPYYqTZ3dxvPcS48ljyQQAM7HsX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/aN2dlNZFbj5oyITi7bdnbaxp3WO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festa del Cinema di Roma","release_date":"2024-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
