Featuring a cast which includes Jennifer Beals, Jean Stapleton and Matthew Broderick it shines with intelligence and romance.  It even subtly improves on the Disney classic by giving the prince a proper name; that of Henry. Jennifer Beals does admirable work as the title heroine, humanizing(as much as she can)one of the archetypal figures in mythical storytelling. Matthew Broderick infuses Prince Henry with undeniable charm while still maintaining a palpable shyness which perceptively suits the character as he finds true love. Jean Stapleton's boisterous Fairy Godmother befits the character's role as an agent for dynamic change in the story.","popularity":2.6695,"poster_path":"/9pEcamPkXkOdznQR8vXX3jemwR5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaylord
