One night, Souad falls into a coma and is taken to the hospital.  Saïd and Soumia, left to their own devices, try to keep their mother's absence a secret for as long as possible to escape the shelter.  Brams, 22, a neighborhood thug, quickly understands what he can do with the two children's weakness. Little by little, the apartment turns into a place of dealing. Saïd is captivated by his new friends.  Soumia, put in danger by her brother's attitude, goes to live in a shelter. She triggers, much against her will, the institutions' investigation.  Will Saïd, now alone with Brams, escape the shelter?","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/dghDktPyxe6qCOS0XkFtce7vnSU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nexus
