Miraculously, all 12 passengers and crew survive the accident, but their safety is anything but assured. The aircraft has flown miles off course, and its position is unknown. Food supplies are low, the temperature is dropping, and their radio battery is running out of juice. Time is quickly running out. The fate of the survivors will depend on one man, one plane, and one inspired idea.","popularity":0.0498,"poster_path":"/dc9hpac8NKiZLf4yxLIITIeRwBF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6298,"logo_path":"/2pBvKkc9QlFaopszammMmffGWTT.png","name":"Spiegel TV","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":137140,"logo_path":"/24Gu0QzuDp6umZ3qgnwAru6KiiC.png","name":"The Smithsonian Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stranded: Alpine Air Crash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beng Spies","original_name":"Beng Spies","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66ef10f1b348bea4eb3b25c6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christina Karrer","original_name":"Christina Karrer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef11094a7f0b18b026147d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christina Karrer","original_name":"Christina Karrer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef111192d39685383b25a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1973395,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patricia Wagner","original_name":"Patricia Wagner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef11234a7f0b18b0261497","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1973395,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patricia Wagner","original_name":"Patricia Wagner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef112d5ee61fbb738d475f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dc9hpac8NKiZLf4yxLIITIeRwBF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eZJwrjPpJpf1enZ6VSOkxLgPDLK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
