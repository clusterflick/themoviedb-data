In touch with the pain as well as the pleasure of over-collecting, she calls Ron “Disaster Master” Alford for help. Ron, a de-cluttering expert who believes that “clutter begins in the head, and ends up on the floor,” determines that Michele is a hoarder with a rating of 8 (out of ten) on his “clutter index.” Ron also visits a retired Marine with 7,800 Beanie Babies and a home shopping addict whose purchases are literally burying him. Never Enough is a meditation on materialism, consumerism, mental illness and the social fabric of our lives.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do You Own Your Stuff or Does It Own You?","title":"Never Enough","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2042159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Anderson","original_name":"Kelly Anderson","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/kPK1B2aCTLUBaTvLQ7HBcvz2KoK.jpg","credit_id":"66eec30f7300a5ba213b092a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
