It was filmed at a clinic in Chester, Pa., a small city which at that time had a 30% unemployment rate. The clinic was chosen because it was representative of abortion clinics in the United States. The clinic also offered individual counseling in which the reasons behind the decision are explored.  During their five months at the clinic, the film's producers met with hundreds of women. The two whose abortions are shown in this film are single, white and young -- as are the majority of women who have had abortions in the United States over the past 30 years.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143561,"logo_path":"/fDz3pETHIkgrr6usIiUr8c7BXU1.png","name":"FRONTLINE","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abortion Clinic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Obenhaus","original_name":"Mark Obenhaus","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eee9505ee61fbb738d39b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
