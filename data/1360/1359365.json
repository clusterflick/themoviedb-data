In an effort to stimulate her mind, Arthur tells tall-tales about the mysterious scar on his chest, which appeared the same day Mercy lost her memory. His wild tales take Mercy, and the audience, to a sword fight with a samurai warrior; a gunfight in the Old West; an escape from pirates on the Mediterranean Sea. The setting is always different, but hints of the truth are woven within, hoping to remain hidden within these fantasy worlds.","popularity":0.114,"poster_path":"/bxHLwEhQ53gOKpLEd0ZLhWksbgy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3784308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xan Churchwell","original_name":"Xan Churchwell","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/iZbwv55p1k5HjDwOazekF256Hwl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mercy","credit_id":"66edeefe4a7f0b18b025cd37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4318737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Copeland Jr.","original_name":"Thomas Copeland Jr.","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/lCOL30NcHKzTjVCpAhLclYE5Man.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Arthur","credit_id":"66edef0e6fd7cc7d423ade94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4455568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Dee","original_name":"Alex Dee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Villain","credit_id":"66edef290ea80d1fe38cf81c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Sable","original_name":"Jeff Sable","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Larkin","credit_id":"66edef396fd7cc7d423adead","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Simon","original_name":"George Simon","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66edeebbb348bea4eb3adfeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934108,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew Koltuniuk","original_name":"Andrew Koltuniuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ec0959ff681d9e0a484e4","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934113,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Michael Uyehata","original_name":"Michael Uyehata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67212c5647fe097c193f74fc","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5026782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kory Kast","original_name":"Kory Kast","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67216976974a676c6df33273","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5030044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Cuccinelli","original_name":"Marielle Cuccinelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6723f6a9cb548b716a823301","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Rose","original_name":"Melinda Rose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729100b2282fe0e5b8ba4f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Rose","original_name":"Melinda Rose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672910152282fe0e5b8ba50f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4521740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Simon","original_name":"George Simon","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672fda7859036d2bcf08fc4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11306318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/24HXVb5SJlDgOR4UTSMCWzVk17.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxHLwEhQ53gOKpLEd0ZLhWksbgy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Scar  |  Promo","key":"124tm7qT62c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-02T23:01:24.000Z","id":"672fdb9d5a65bb8190dd3298"}]}}}
