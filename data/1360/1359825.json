Faced with losing their cultural heritage they become spies and they go undercover in ISIS territory. They dodge bombs and militia to create a system to monitor theft and destruction of Syrian antiquities. During this process, they discover more than they anticipated, discovering thousands of trafficked items and that the crimes committed are being enabled by terrorists and multinational corporations. The tragedy continues because the sale of illegal goods are uncovered in the most unsuspecting place.","popularity":0.359,"poster_path":"/iHZBSYZF6JYM1AMKzV6QpnxpaDW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artifact War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4955764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amr Al-Azm","original_name":"Amr Al-Azm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ef53a17300a5ba213b319d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4955767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Paul","original_name":"Katie Paul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ef53c4d4a8ac49678d4f7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4955781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adnan Almohamad","original_name":"Adnan Almohamad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ef58386fd7cc7d423b3900","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4385371,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evan Michael Carpenter","original_name":"Evan Michael Carpenter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef53e3a82b005703261fc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4955772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Schwarz","original_name":"Jacob Schwarz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef5408a82b00570326201c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4955772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Schwarz","original_name":"Jacob Schwarz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef542f6fd7cc7d423b35e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4385371,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evan Michael Carpenter","original_name":"Evan Michael Carpenter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef543f6fd7cc7d423b35ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130762,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brenden Bytheway","original_name":"Brenden Bytheway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef545e0ea80d1fe38d4969","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Doug May","original_name":"Doug May","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef5469a82b00570326208a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willem Kampenhout","original_name":"Willem Kampenhout","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef5590a82b005703262349","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4955775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carissa Klitgaard","original_name":"Carissa Klitgaard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef55a3d4a8ac49678d5198","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4385372,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathryn Crapo Schwarz","original_name":"Kathryn Crapo Schwarz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef55bd6fd7cc7d423b3763","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Siemers","original_name":"Matthew Siemers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef55db4a7f0b18b0262d2e","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33255538","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iHZBSYZF6JYM1AMKzV6QpnxpaDW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":191111,"name":"syria"},{"id":220991,"name":"isis (daesh)"},{"id":250043,"name":"art heist"},{"id":256693,"name":"syrian civil war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Austin Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
