The Egyptian billionaire businessman, who died last year aged 94, is accused of multiple counts of rape and attempted rape by the women who worked for him. At the time of many of the alleged attacks, Al Fayed was the owner of London’s luxury department store Harrods, the iconic Ritz Paris hotel and English football club Fulham FC.  The BBC has heard testimony from over 20 survivors, with 13 featured in the film. With horrifying accounts of abuse that spanned Al Fayed’s 25-year reign at Harrods, for the first time the scale and seriousness of these allegations are exposed, as well as the system that helped cover it up. A web of corruption and fear that extended from the shop floors to the highest levels of the organization is revealed. Brave survivors now break their silence.","popularity":0.206,"poster_path":"/8sAFePLKKQAx54nWazViW96vxr5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4068412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Al-Fayed","original_name":"Mohamed Al-Fayed","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive)","credit_id":"66ed372f2dcb758bbfadb623","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Stevenson","original_name":"Vanessa Stevenson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"66f008d2b348bea4eb3b5f7a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2393313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erica Gornall","original_name":"Erica Gornall","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef1094c237258e4c25f970","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4528151,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Russell","original_name":"Simon Russell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f0091b4a7f0b18b026560e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520071,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike Radford","original_name":"Mike Radford","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/muH3PwEKwiLZ4qzpIEGMChOsqFa.jpg","credit_id":"66f00947b348bea4eb3b5fc1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2393313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erica Gornall","original_name":"Erica Gornall","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f00962b348bea4eb3b5ffd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3229651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cassie Cornish-Trestrail","original_name":"Cassie Cornish-Trestrail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f009924a7f0b18b02656ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33423099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/69ubiJyxgGDZ1Ju01UyEife8zbQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8sAFePLKKQAx54nWazViW96vxr5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lfrYwapW7gXfMbWOVroHbU4ABZ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":570,"name":"rape"},{"id":739,"name":"sexual abuse"},{"id":338764,"name":"mohamed al fayed"},{"id":338765,"name":"harrods"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC Two/iPlayer","release_date":"2024-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
