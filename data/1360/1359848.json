Beginning in the late winter, just before leaves appear on the trees, the film records the changes in weather, foliage, color, and light throughout a year.  The images provide visual cues from which viewers can imagine their own sound tracks — a music of the sounds of wind and water.\r Yet, weather is not the only painter of this picture.  A choice of black–and–white film for a passage of patterns on the ice evokes Chinese ink painting, and distorted reflections of architectural details and views through purposely out–of–focus trees inspire, in the imagination, paintings of what is not shown, but might be.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bE8EomFnHt6co4GQx2OZDryMiYT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watercolors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2971376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Deborah Levy","original_name":"Ann Deborah Levy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ef7127d4a8ac49678d5910","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5h1G4nJdF9y581MYOuBTOvoPJk1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bE8EomFnHt6co4GQx2OZDryMiYT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
