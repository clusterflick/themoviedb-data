Through victories that rewrote the history of Italian sports, such as the conquest of five World Cups and numerous medals across the Olympics and World Championships, the documentary celebrates internal rivalries, contrasting personalities, and the sacrifices that made this team invincible. The previously unseen testimonies of the protagonists, intertwined with the narration of Giovanni Veronesi, who, in this context, reveals his past as an aspiring champion, bring to life the unique saga of a sporting cyclone, from its glorious beginnings to its inevitable decline.","popularity":0.1476,"poster_path":"/gOcfNDL0PJF9T4gukhc2eb15wTM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2441,"logo_path":"/7Vutdea75apwXkRyfQ4Ne6j0KcN.png","name":"Fandango","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto
