With precise gestures, learned since childhood, Ouardia raises the water, crouches down to splash his face with cool water. Soon her baby will be born. Hadjila, the traditional midwife, prepares herself internally to help the mother complete the transition from separation. This film talks about the knowledge surrounding birth that Kabyle women have passed down for centuries; knowledge that European women seek to rediscover in order to reclaim this founding passage of our lives.","popularity":0.2418,"poster_path":"/wC4Ewn2c8DGV78OSdkrESriSUrq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pour Que Ses Jours Fleurissent","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4953988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Ferry","original_name":"Nicole Ferry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ede497b348bea4eb3adde2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4953988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Ferry","original_name":"Nicole Ferry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ede49eb348bea4eb3adde7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4953988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Ferry","original_name":"Nicole Ferry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ede4b4a82b00570325c740","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ooVfeBMlFjmoeJuVETvBvwEzSzi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wC4Ewn2c8DGV78OSdkrESriSUrq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":941,"name":"tradition"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":247646,"name":"babies"},{"id":271448,"name":"ethnology"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":293660,"name":"kabylie, algeria"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"},{"id":337587,"name":"amazigh culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
