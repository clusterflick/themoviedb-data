After Clara leaves, the woman follows Jack around the store even eventually onto the roof of the building and they are locked in by the night watchman and must remain on the roof all night. Jack realizes his wife will never believe this story, so he invents a yarn about visiting his friend John Brown (White) in a distant town. Clara suspects that story and contacts Brown, while Jack convinces a friend to impersonate Brown and come to his house, but the real Brown shows up too and things become complicated with the arrival of Mrs. Brown (Schaefer), the pretty young woman who caused all the trouble, but, after she introduces herself as one of Clara's cousins, all ends happily.","popularity":0.3796,"poster_path":"/8XI6QuR897YfUxZSHb0PCjIn09X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Temple's Telegram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryant Washburn","original_name":"Bryant Washburn","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":"/5UlSMWoAnoXIoa5cTv7yf1yECRn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jack Temple","credit_id":"5e699017459ad6001360012b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Hawley","original_name":"Wanda Hawley","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/hDLCnGfPRTwp6egZxHn7EIRsdaB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Clara Temple","credit_id":"5e69901d459ad60013600141","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1373043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Phillips","original_name":"Carmen Phillips","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/lAJYqVzmDwM0nqvVMuXrAwFXvoP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Pauline","credit_id":"5e699028151c5c0017064d94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Hiers","original_name":"Walter Hiers","popularity":0.1245,"profile_path":"/u0OR95aRdkx4BdT91k3bF6itiGl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Frank Fuller","credit_id":"5e69902d459ad600185efdae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Ashton","original_name":"Sylvia Ashton","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/s18TRWa31RZYb5CUkFAQRhlt0TR.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Fuller","credit_id":"5e69903555c9260017653489","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo White","original_name":"Leo White","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/pKJDApReiE0EVmmkTYbHNW7d1Yu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"John Brown","credit_id":"66df9de14f99b7f05c6cb684","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Brown","credit_id":"66df9df4a0057447dc0d89a7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Jobson","original_name":"Edward Jobson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nrrIQoD10D5dHbsVkcXeigAOWB.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Wigson","credit_id":"66df9e100000000000e8c3fc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588555,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry Kotani","original_name":"Henry Kotani","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/qGT9lttP0cH9ZvUsH4l4BJChFzF.jpg","credit_id":"5e69900e55c9260017653441","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563348,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Morris","original_name":"William Morris","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e698ffd55c9260019652ecd","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Wyatt","original_name":"Frank Wyatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e69900655c9260017653434","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","credit_id":"5e698f5f2f3b1700193f65f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234677,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elmer Harris","original_name":"Elmer Harris","popularity":0.139,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e698fdccabfe400150eefa5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adolph Zukor","original_name":"Adolph Zukor","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/h4gkeIGlb8fybIxrPokalu23oFX.jpg","credit_id":"66df9e32ba0f7afc314f684c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004059,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jesse L.
