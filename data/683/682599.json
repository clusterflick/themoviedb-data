A psychedelic experimenter, cyberspace pioneer, and environmentalist, he is now urging humanity to use our god-like powers to reframe our relationship with time and life itself. Today, Stewart is using biotech to resurrect extinct species. He and a team of scientists travel to Siberia to collect ancient DNA in an effort to make a hybrid Woolly Mammoth. Former allies in the environmental movement vow to stand in his way, but Stewart forges ahead in his life-long mission to conserve the whole earth.","popularity":0.7182,"poster_path":"/65C5nw6Rd9eWbSpFGA7BWMZRfap.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140625,"logo_path":"/5bfT1xXojwMO6puPG1N0L9pSL5P.png","name":"Stripe Press","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about Stewart Brand.","title":"We Are As Gods","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Brand","original_name":"Stewart Brand","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/2S3WjssRiEWP48wRWi6LhkMFrfz.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"652670d5cedac400c53f2121","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37317,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Eno","original_name":"Brian Eno","popularity":0.3595,"profile_path":"/lLdYPTiwg5uvFFSY70TI3CCJYE4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6b777c0443c9003aeb050f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1805509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Kelly","original_name":"Kevin Kelly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lmm3a2RKQMrKkeGqf759i0kiVyJ.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67dcccbc5f977836ab7a5969","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Church","original_name":"George Church","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67dccce31cda1dbb467a5a63","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37317,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Eno","original_name":"Brian Eno","popularity":0.3595,"profile_path":"/lLdYPTiwg5uvFFSY70TI3CCJYE4.jpg","credit_id":"60694be55507e9003ff3b05a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1800392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Alvarado","original_name":"David Alvarado","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694bfb699fb7002a369f4d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1851242,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annukka Lilja","original_name":"Annukka Lilja","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694c02d55c3d005751c4c2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637951,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ben Sozanski","original_name":"Ben Sozanski","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694c08699fb7002a369f55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1800392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Alvarado","original_name":"David Alvarado","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694c115507e9003ff3b0ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Sussberg","original_name":"Jason Sussberg","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694c1a12c6040040c330b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1292126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate McLean","original_name":"Kate McLean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694c22d55c3d0077cd59d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1032100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Meltzer","original_name":"Jamie Meltzer","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60694c2a44ea540059316a05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":381120,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry S.
