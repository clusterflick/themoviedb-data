It is a four-year journey in Svalbard. Rising temperatures are responsible for dramatic changes in Frost's ecosystem as the ice is melting at record speed. From complete darkness to the absolute light of the midnight sun, Svalbard transforms from a cold and inhospitable place to the most joyous and lively scene for ice algae, fish, birds and animals. But alongside these seasonal transformations, the disappearing sea ice forces life to new limits. Fjords that were once full of ice and seals, get abandoned pushing Frost further away. Asgeir is determined to find her and document all that is being lost, but his task is far from easy. This film explores the question \"this planet is home to all of us, can we afford to ignore it?\"","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":"/7QghGW1mW6dCuXCgQZssiLXedQW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SJ","name":"Svalbard & Jan Mayen Islands"}],"release_date":"2018-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen Without Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Auf Wiedersehen Eisb√§r!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2200772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asgeir Helgestad","original_name":"Asgeir Helgestad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e68321b151c5c001303ffb5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2200772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asgeir Helgestad","original_name":"Asgeir Helgestad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e683229151c5c0017044e01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8587280","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7QghGW1mW6dCuXCgQZssiLXedQW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Wildlife Film Festiva","release_date":"2018-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
