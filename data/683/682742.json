They discover, in their own way, something that transcends all that divides us in a world lost in the speed and noise of the digital age.","popularity":0.3898,"poster_path":"/8QLCRfxR4RLpgLLa9xEwmYtAxKq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes of the Invisible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Elkins","original_name":"Steve Elkins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6ab789357c0000193ff2c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11916296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8QLCRfxR4RLpgLLa9xEwmYtAxKq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3593,"name":"wilderness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
