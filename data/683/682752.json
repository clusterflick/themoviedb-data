Yes, the strength of what is eternally equal, a burden on our very lives. An empty discourse in favour of an order that grants nothing, but conformity. A thinking and acting dedicated to arrogance, to the sublimation of what he does not want to change, because he is too stable. The same inertia that, every day, takes a life; and returns a death. No, here there is no passion, no crime, there is nothing, but a method to try not to perceive subtle changes... There are no more poets or philosophers, nor even people; this whole vast world is made up of masked faces, in silence, before the very drama that, in their dreams, they would like to realize.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3KT7u3zhQ9oOp8HDLgRO4d9XXIn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2013-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The unbearable mundanity of being","title":"The unbearable mundanity of being","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2564407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","original_name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wreeP5hAW7Yw2Cvv9teuFyaA0q4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e6abe0955c926001566e329","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Goncalves","original_name":"Carlos Goncalves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e6abe15459ad60018604c5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Solano","original_name":"Ricardo Solano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e6abe2055c926001566e3ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Sáez","original_name":"Stephanie Sáez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e6abe2ccabfe4001110a9d5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2564407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","original_name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wreeP5hAW7Yw2Cvv9teuFyaA0q4.jpg","credit_id":"5e6abe57cabfe4001110aa8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2564407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","original_name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wreeP5hAW7Yw2Cvv9teuFyaA0q4.jpg","credit_id":"5e6abe79cedac40015482ea3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2564407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","original_name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wreeP5hAW7Yw2Cvv9teuFyaA0q4.jpg","credit_id":"5e6abe6c2f3b17001140a584","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2564407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","original_name":"Joan Sebastián Araujo Arena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wreeP5hAW7Yw2Cvv9teuFyaA0q4.jpg","credit_id":"5e6abe62cedac40017482e7d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11957126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/3KT7u3zhQ9oOp8HDLgRO4d9XXIn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"«La insoportable cotidianidad del ser» (I) [Obra propia]","key":"E-NXst7qrZE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-04-30T22:12:38.000Z","id":"5e6abecc459ad60011600329"}]}}}
