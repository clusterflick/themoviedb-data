Driven by the philosophy and theory of Jacques Derrida, the architects of Deconstructivism are rooted in a movement that urges us to examine the space we move through. Deconstructivist Architects documents explosive and seemingly chaotic structures from Vienna to L.A., and interviews those who pursue its aesthetic issues. Filmed on location with the architects and at the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition Deconstructivist Architecture, which was curated by Philip Johnson.","popularity":0.2022,"poster_path":"/dt6YxZaQDiFtE01hX2kX6Vf1mYZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deconstructivist
