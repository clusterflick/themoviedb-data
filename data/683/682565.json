The 10 minute abstract film uses raw material of video feedback and some nuclear bomb footage to represent “the cruel chaotic dysfunctional nature of the human condition with all its potential for self destruction”. Allday wanted a soundtrack that complemented the film thematically and approached Mallinder to see if he’d be interested in creating the audio.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recoil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Allday","original_name":"Nick Allday","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e699e952973380011c95578","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Allday","original_name":"Nick Allday","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e699ebb151c5c001506037b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Mallinder","original_name":"Stephen Mallinder","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e699ec8cedac4001746ad36","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
