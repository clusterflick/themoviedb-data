The ship also has aboard an elderly couple, Heinrich and Anna Thomas, who are on their anniversary cruise. Midway across the Atlantic Ocean, the \"Atlantic\" strikes an iceberg and is damaged to the point where it is sinking into the Atlantic. The German version was filmed at the same time as the British version, with each scene first being filmed in English for the British version, then the same scene being filmed in German by a German cast, using the same sets.","popularity":0.4221,"poster_path":"/1tYNneWNzhBO1qkl5PhqwdsBSwW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1929-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atlantic","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Kortner","original_name":"Fritz Kortner","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/9Yj5OwxoFVP8fkBo4Ey89KfCZrL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Heinrich Thomas","credit_id":"5e6ab413459ad60018603a73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Wagner","original_name":"Elsa Wagner","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/f8ELn1caKeFZjxaGS3VAK2M4pA1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Anna, Heinrich's wife","credit_id":"5e6ab426cedac40015481601","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Schroth","original_name":"Heinrich Schroth","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/2BWGbhunDt0RMQVNKI8N51AuPTV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6ab42d2f3b170017406be9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Serda","original_name":"Julia Serda","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/yge6rsRwy7KfxQqfznLUn5vsXa9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6ab43355c9260019668a3a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elfriede Borodin","original_name":"Elfriede Borodin","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e6ab43a459ad60013619c03","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willi Forst","original_name":"Willi Forst","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/4F3ih8zuogR2d7GrL5Uye10UFH4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Poldi","credit_id":"66e62101050f14e4fccf40d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Mannheim","original_name":"Lucie Mannheim","popularity":0.1728,"profile_path":"/iGg7YJjYFZ8cIAaayceXy1uS5Vj.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Monica","credit_id":"66e6211fe8211ecd22b04b8c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Lederer","original_name":"Francis Lederer","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/jf2hWEynH4PbygMSp0hbXqAGJ8l.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"66e62134e8211ecd22b04b9a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodor Loos","original_name":"Theodor Loos","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/9PbtusE5TJYfyQrWb6brBXuXTLX.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Pastor Wagner","credit_id":"66e6215ae8211ecd22b04bc5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Vallentin","original_name":"Hermann Vallentin","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/sQMuiwy5Ifx0RzvNYVvzXV1nOFe.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Dr. Holtz","credit_id":"66e621803768a73f8d911acb","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"E.A.
