Just over 300 patrons were dancing and laughing as last call rolled around 2AM. Moments later a terrorist attack shattered the seemingly “safe space” of one of Orlando’s beloved gay bars. When the madness subsided, 49 beautiful souls were lost, dozens more injured, and a community of thousands was left broken. But what has happened since that night to the survivors—the ones who lost friends and lovers, who are bonded together by an unthinkable act of violence? This powerful and amazingly hopeful testament gathers together many of the people who hunkered down in bathroom stalls and behind the bar and allows them a space to share the details of that night and the ongoing effects of living through a “national tragedy” from an incredibly intimate perspective.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/hjUKhvnw2RLpGw4GBB64Ag7eT2P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surviving Pulse: Life After a Mass Shooting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Forgotten Survivors, a Pulse Documentary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexa Sheehan","original_name":"Alexa Sheehan","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/5whspQj4zm55q2wbp2hWmqwMcfa.jpg","credit_id":"6247387ec4ad59009f7ad332","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7004908","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFbEuIDWBw6X2iiScke0rnGi3Yn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hjUKhvnw2RLpGw4GBB64Ag7eT2P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
