When \"A\" meets Ferdinand, the whole balance he lives in will crumble. First an \"aesthetic\" attraction which will turn into desire will reveal to him his true image. He will then switch into what he called \"madness\", unreason. Ferdinand's world is, on the contrary, unimaginable, because outside of all morality, of all Manichaeism. It is a \"revealed\" world because his homosexuality has transformed his view of things. Will the relationship established between Ferdinand and \"A\" be viable? Will there be a necessity of death, or a possibility of life?","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/4xp3czapRLxlpMVobHhmsyfmNlx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem à l'aube","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Desbordes","original_name":"Olivier Desbordes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6248889310dad600637b2ed0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0294871","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4xp3czapRLxlpMVobHhmsyfmNlx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
