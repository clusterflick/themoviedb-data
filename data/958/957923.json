Coinciding with the 25th Anniversary of the band’s formation, this live concert is an evocative testament to one of the greatest exponents of British progressive rock.  Opening with an extended and haunting rendition of Mockingbird, the guitars of John Lees and Colin Browne blend magnificently on Medicine Man and Play to the World, with Les Holroyd rendering a dramatic vocal performance on the latter. BJH’s more ponderous progressive rock set pieces are pierced by the rousing upbeat guitar-based Life Is for the Living and the crowd pleasing Stand Up.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hv5D5CAwt7t4De1Fkpx2333AOSt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barclay James Harvest - Live at the Town and Country Club","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3491212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lees","original_name":"John Lees","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oskjgj4MpEcF2BKDFtHdKfnlC31.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"guitar, vocals","credit_id":"624989c45ff34e004ea9e870","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Holroyd","original_name":"Les Holroyd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"bass guitar, vocals","credit_id":"624989ec8eda87004ea9ae9f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Pritchard","original_name":"Mel Pritchard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"drums, percussion","credit_id":"62498a0184591c004f06d4b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin McAlea","original_name":"Kevin McAlea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"keyboards, saxophone","credit_id":"62498a1a5ff34e00a3b27050","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3491220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Browne","original_name":"Colin Browne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"guitar, percussion, backing vocals","credit_id":"62498a3bcb71b80063ea0f10","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2114,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hv5D5CAwt7t4De1Fkpx2333AOSt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
