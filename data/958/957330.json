By visually adapting Deleuze’s analysis of Quad (The Exhausted, 1995), the film explores the idea of \"The exhaustion of possibilities” through stop-motion animation. The puppets and the printed images slowly disintegrate, and the residue envisions new possibilities.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9iKpuCtdBWLeMGyVjrqqamgEHDd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exhausted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2696650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heehyun Choi","original_name":"Heehyun Choi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/DUIbjxM8yfjZhig7KRgzm1Wphn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65c6fc67ce6c4c017cb8a96c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Jinsoo Kim","original_name":"Justin Jinsoo Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6247470362e86f004f7dc8d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Jinsoo Kim","original_name":"Justin Jinsoo Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c6fcd1aad9c2017db63084","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9iKpuCtdBWLeMGyVjrqqamgEHDd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
