Set to classical music and featuring “hippies,” a dancing model, and national political figures, Paik’s five-minute contribution is a form of what he called “participation television.” Here, he instructs you — his audience — to open or close your eyes while the hallucinatory images swirl and twist into frame. The original premiere marked Paik’s first foray into television broadcast and remains an early and ironic example of his ambition to turn inherently passive viewers into active and integral participants.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/zEDuvtl7JMEMlswhQpOjYNhiHd7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nam June Paik","title":"Electronic Opera no. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Electronic Opera #1","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"6248316a17c44300a25ac279","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11905134","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zEDuvtl7JMEMlswhQpOjYNhiHd7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
