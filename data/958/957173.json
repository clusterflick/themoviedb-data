The film portrays the belvédère of the Boekentoren, Ghent’s university library, built by Flemish modernist Henry Van De Velde. In a continuous panoramic shot, taken from the centre of the interior, the camera scans both the modernist wooden pillars as the stark windows framing the city skyline and Ghent’s historic towers.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/osY9oR00E8UiOzu71DwO8vACU1k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boekentoren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robbrecht Desmet","original_name":"Robbrecht Desmet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246c310a3e4ba009f71b4f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2968,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/osY9oR00E8UiOzu71DwO8vACU1k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1979}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
