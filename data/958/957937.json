It is winter, the house is in a clearing. The grass is high and the garden is abandoned. Inside the house there are several boxes scattered around the room, old things in the corners. In the kitchen the fire burns gently on the iron stove. Near the house runs a river, where Marcelo takes refuge from the confusion of memories that accompanies him. The encounter with the past is the necessary fuse to move forward.","popularity":0.0745,"poster_path":"/r6tXqFs9jhc6VeYqdyvmm1v8ug9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Orvalho e o Rio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3602957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcilênio Arruda","original_name":"Marcilênio Arruda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62b87f58229ae20b5aa200e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luiz Carlos Conti","original_name":"Luiz Carlos Conti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62b87f647ef381043537d057","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3602960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viviane Dutra","original_name":"Viviane Dutra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62b87f6f7304b5037549b7eb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2690641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonardo Pinheiro","original_name":"Leonardo Pinheiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62498a9fcb71b80063ea0f63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22783850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u2YLQFAm2XoCLJFbH5noM2x2FqU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/r6tXqFs9jhc6VeYqdyvmm1v8ug9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
