She is over 2600 years old. This is the self-portrait of the oldest city in France. A city whose landscapes bear the scars of a destiny that has spared it no trials. Gateway to the Orient, crossroads of trade and immigration, Marseille is a mosaic with 111 districts and 200 nationalities. Rebellious, chaotic, in turn desired, torn apart, transformed, it is reborn each time from its ashes. Marseille tells us more about the history of France and sheds light on what France is today.","popularity":0.1151,"poster_path":"/yrqqvOf6jSfNuMxVOXoEBIyylLO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":91242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nilaya Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il était une fois Marseille","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2334522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Luciani","original_name":"Clara Luciani","popularity":0.3308,"profile_path":"/GD2Ng21vxEX4i4TbGCpJeT81hu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6247f957713ea600a1e2c8ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akhenaton","original_name":"Akhenaton","popularity":0.1867,"profile_path":"/6D6BdDmnsSVFTOFAaEDovsOnDGz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63fad1e4344a8e00aa1b82a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariane Ascaride","original_name":"Ariane Ascaride","popularity":0.2305,"profile_path":"/tBwt69J3EeSHUNYYtxbI0r40KoT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63fad1ea57176f007cfd24b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Guédiguian","original_name":"Robert Guédiguian","popularity":0.2491,"profile_path":"/io8Hw0SgxV5LVsgtfORJSltBx5v.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63fad202344a8e00867ce4bf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugues Nancy","original_name":"Hugues Nancy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6247f9824bfa540095a4a27b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19720262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7fty3KWLhDEXCXl6Z8j4PiZu1VO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rBQmEaXh0NKZ6zgrNjtXUOIB1aW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yrqqvOf6jSfNuMxVOXoEBIyylLO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Diffusion sur France 3","release_date":"2022-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
