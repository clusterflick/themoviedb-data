Painted in the Renaissance styles of Albrecht Dürer and Albrecht Altdorfer, the painting—measuring 14 meters high and 123 meters wide—is in the Panorama Museum in Bad Frankenhausen, Thuringia, the site of the last battle of the German Peasants’ War. The museum was specifically built for the painting, one of the most figurative in recent art history.Interspersed with interviews with the artist, the documentary follows the complicated and elaborate creation of the monumental work, from signing the contract in 1976 to the last brush stroke on September 11, 1987. In 2011, the Panorama Museum was awarded the European Seal of Cultural Heritage.","popularity":0.1059,"poster_path":"/fC3nr8CyKENODuIuC31ZQu2SVZh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1988-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle on Canvas: The Creation of a Monumental Painting by Werner Tübke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Tübke","original_name":"Werner Tübke","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6246a6992e2b2c004e09ac25","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287621,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evelyn Kuhnert","original_name":"Evelyn Kuhnert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246a6d25c5cc8004e4f8077","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2069404,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Detlef Tetzke","original_name":"Detlef Tetzke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246a6aa66f2d20063963605","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2733027,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jürgen Partzsch","original_name":"Jürgen Partzsch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246a6fd66f2d2006396367b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2069404,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Detlef Tetzke","original_name":"Detlef Tetzke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246a6bb62e86f0063776892","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl-Ernst Sasse","original_name":"Karl-Ernst Sasse","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246a71162e86f004f7c7285","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fC3nr8CyKENODuIuC31ZQu2SVZh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1988-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
