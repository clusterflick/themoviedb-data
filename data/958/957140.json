Accompanied by curator Norman Rosenthal, who first exhibited paintings by Baselitz in the early 1970's, the artist discusses painting, sculpture and the trajectory of his work. The exhibit emphasizes Baselitz ability to create imagery that deals unflinchingly with his position as a post-war artist. In responding to contemporary experience and exploring his own painterly instincts, Baselitz creates symbols which reflect deep-rooted human dilemmas and concerns.","popularity":0.1006,"poster_path":"/vioLFv0fwNtKPXKv4Hpi2FxEdSZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Georg Baselitz: Making Art after Auschwitz and Dresden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Baselitz","original_name":"Georg Baselitz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6246a3e3dd47160095bf69a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Rosenthal","original_name":"Norman Rosenthal","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6246a3ef8ee49c00a1267b01","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"6246a40665e0a2004e93bd4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joëlle Schon","original_name":"Joëlle Schon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246a4363396b9004ef59c77","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1833699","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vioLFv0fwNtKPXKv4Hpi2FxEdSZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Georg Baselitz: Making Art after Auschwitz and Dresden [trailer]","key":"rx-7ycUHNtg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-12T17:33:03.000Z","id":"6246a34f3344c6004ff5a1cf"}]}}}
