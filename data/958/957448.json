They are sent back to the Wild West (19th century), Prehistoric times (50,000 BC), Medieval Times (12th century), the Caribbean Pirates era (17th century), WW2 Prisoner of War Camps (1940s); and sent forward in time to a Parallel Universe, where all the inhabitants are colored (blue, red, green, yellow, pink and purple faced). But there's a twist - each theater actor must complete three individual quests, before sunset. Those who fail will be marooned in that time and place forever.","popularity":0.0521,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Present!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Souriau-Levine","original_name":"Justin Souriau-Levine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624779cf8ee49c006483241a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Souriau-Levine","original_name":"Justin Souriau-Levine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624779d8a0be280051a01d5b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18183896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
