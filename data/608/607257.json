Legends say they are man-eaters, that even crocodiles fear them. Locals call them \"demon fish\" but angling legend Andy Coetzee calls them something else: an obsession. He dives into the predator-infested Okavango Delta and the treacherous Congo River on a mission to finally land what is considered to be the hardest fish in the world to catch.","popularity":0.1018,"poster_path":"/4J0fMrWkYmF6A9NLz3uI4NtfdH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Earth Touch","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa's Piranha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3480897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Coetzee","original_name":"Andy Coetzee","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"642b1bcdac8e6b00b4d693dc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Ainsworth","original_name":"Brian Ainsworth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040b1197ecd28005761c636","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861480,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brennan Nurthen","original_name":"Brennan Nurthen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040b107db70580077724e15","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kira Ivanoff","original_name":"Kira Ivanoff","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/tehsFdJXWA8FtnR2tocOKwcZNKC.jpg","credit_id":"6040b0a979b3d40025d3e7b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1908950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kira Ivanoff","original_name":"Kira Ivanoff","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/tehsFdJXWA8FtnR2tocOKwcZNKC.jpg","credit_id":"6040b0995690b50045d49f98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280490,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grant Brokensha","original_name":"Grant Brokensha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a6e2af6bc9716e8726d51","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604212,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Boon","original_name":"James Boon","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a6e374bf0f0e3b4749536","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997992,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Riaan Laubscher","original_name":"Riaan Laubscher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a6e444bf0f0e3b4749543","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160040,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thor Janke","original_name":"Thor Janke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a727b816b2810d166e385","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4J0fMrWkYmF6A9NLz3uI4NtfdH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/60XY4VGrYj9zTzDMYoExhySLaNA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
