The exhibition will display more than 50 paintings, prints and drawings in which this modern master of British art turned his unflinching eye firmly on himself. One of the most celebrated painters of our time, Lucian Freud is also one of very few 20th-century artists who portrayed themselves with such consistency.  Spanning nearly seven decades his self-portraits give a fascinating insight into both his psyche and his development as a painter, from his earliest portrait painted in 1939 to the final one executed 64 years later. When seen together, his portraits represent an engrossing study into the dynamic of ageing and the process of self-representation. This intensely compelling exhibition creates a unique opportunity for EXHIBITION ON SCREEN to reveal the life’s work of a master in one show.","popularity":0.383,"poster_path":"/57DiyorqS8whmjoVhQpiXrzQ6IK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A modern british master revealed.","title":"Lucian Freud: A Self Portrait","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: Lucian Freud - A Self Portrait","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"EOS: Lucian Freud - A Self Portrait","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucian Freud","original_name":"Lucian Freud","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5eacfc1c27d9cc0022cf250f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bickerstaff","original_name":"David Bickerstaff","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5def7e9b025764001656e1f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5def7eb0f6fd180015edbd3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11654024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"exhibitiononscreen","instagram_id":"exhibitiononscreen","twitter_id":"artonscreen"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nlmSx9GVRiWZILydgpcy4DSot9A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iF34vpQrRIBgUd5UZIxrs3l8AwH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1384,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/57DiyorqS8whmjoVhQpiXrzQ6IK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":940},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/Tf8RnTgSF0c5Qg71PyPzieSdU2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":265473,"name":"exhibition on screen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL TRAILER | Lucian Freud: A Self Portrait (2020)","key":"jWwpVmgvFog","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-09-23T13:24:26.000Z","id":"5def7e31688cd0001421f6a9"}]}}}
