Set in a New York Meat Market restaurant after hours, Butchers' Vogue features a voguing waiter and waitress, two prostitutes on the run, and a cop. In The Draglinquents, the performances of two drag queens are superimposed over cliched images and intercut with 1950's muscle-boy movies. Disco 2000 mixes footage of a crowded dance floor, homemade optical effects, and a dancing chicken.  Butcher's Vogue – Choreography: Richard Move. Music: Madonna. Featuring: Connie Fleming, Gina Vetro, Rebecca Weinberg, Keoki, Joseph Lennon.  The Draglinquents – Featuring: Chucky, Shuck E. Music: \"Maybe\" by The Three Degrees, \"Travelin' Man\" by Dolly Parton.","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/huxc98GgtlJz13QVCJm0jJhCY3K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What I Did Last Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connie Fleming","original_name":"Connie Fleming","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfa696a0e0a267040c9f0d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Vetro","original_name":"Gina Vetro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfa697cc3a36806ee2621a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keoki","original_name":"Keoki","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfa69950e0a2650bdd03280","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Lennon","original_name":"Joseph Lennon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfa699e9251413534bd2e91","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Atlas","original_name":"Charles Atlas","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/dlYNDRuv0iInZxbFxvVTC7UUsbv.jpg","credit_id":"5cfa691f0e0a263073ca2823","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Move","original_name":"Richard Move","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfa69420e0a26706ed0245a","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/huxc98GgtlJz13QVCJm0jJhCY3K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1025}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
