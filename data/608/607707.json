It is perhaps the most significant historical event of all time, as recounted by the gospels but, equally, as depicted by the greatest artists in history.  From the triumphant to the savage, the ethereal to the tactile, some of western civilization’s greatest artworks focus on this pivotal moment. This beautifully crafted film explores the Easter story as depicted in art, from the time of the early Christians to the present day.  Shot on location in Jerusalem, United States and throughout Europe, the film explores the different ways artists have depicted the Easter story through the ages and thus depicts the history of us all.","popularity":0.5675,"poster_path":"/87GKvw40zbkUvXPNBjjWNFpooxh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art
