It is a diary of our work as we head for the Pacific Ocean in a suicidal plunge for theatrical infamy. The film traces the construction of two craven images made in the likeness of myself by Grooms and Gross. Then it switches to the sandhills of Nebraska where fat cattle walk around. There the film explores Grooms' biggest construction, \"The Chicago Installation.\" The film rolls relentlessly onward to the West Coast showing, for the first time on any screen, a theatrical production we three put in the University of California. It marks my directorial debut on the stage and Red Grooms' comeback after ten years of exile from live theatre.\" - George Kuchar","popularity":0.1096,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encyclopedia of the Blessed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bocko","original_name":"Bocko","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/7Vue6H3P6xDGLUmu8lDTUlScS9S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Dog","credit_id":"5cfbdd0c0e0a267113cb2914","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":120939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Floraine Connors","original_name":"Floraine Connors","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/cj0yenmLf256pPXhYlPZAgICOEx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd16c3a36819331f64e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Cowan","original_name":"Bob Cowan","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/lg3pPec11GZpXOKLiKcNfmlQ6vt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd220e0a261b12cb1dab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Red Grooms","original_name":"Red Grooms","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd2c9251411a82b9afea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Gross","original_name":"Mimi Gross","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd359251411a82b9b09c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Kerness","original_name":"Donna Kerness","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/pCVIeMUjsOOrhj3r9UgrpVgHeW5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd3fc3a36836621f06e6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd4c0e0a26168ecb1160","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Leibowitz","original_name":"Frances Leibowitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd5f0e0a265ef8cbba3d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1744619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Leibowitz","original_name":"Larry Leibowitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd6bc3a368057f200c03","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hope Morris","original_name":"Hope Morris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbdd739251416f8eba959a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"5cfbdcec9251414ce3b98b7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206717","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
