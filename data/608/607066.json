A woman with long red hair (G.B. Jones) sits on a window sill and looks down with her binoculars at the street below. Meanwhile, Mary Tyler Moore escapes from an aggressive man and runs to the park. Boy/Girl is a documentation of a period of time when filmmaker LaBruce lived in a crummy, squat-like building at Queen and Parliament Streets in Toronto with the all-girl punk band, Fifth Column.","popularity":0.1186,"poster_path":"/aR7sqsBjLhTSfe6Xx5cbLpiG6vr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy / Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gravelle","original_name":"David Gravelle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf84d3a0e0a265933cbfca1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.B.
