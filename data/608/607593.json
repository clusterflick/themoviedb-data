Fritz Bauer, a previously unknown prosecutor, is on a mission. Against the policy of silence and denial, Bauer wants not only to examine these Nazis but to make the whole of Germany face up to its past.

German society would never be the same.","popularity":0.1473,"poster_path":"/idjuyVk17A92yLelCVaAgadhrXg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":55216,"logo_path":"/pyDDOSzQdVQU5F69qBOgtCn8q9J.png","name":"Kuiv Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fritz Bauer, un procureur contre le nazisme","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Fritz Bauer - Generalstaatsanwalt.
