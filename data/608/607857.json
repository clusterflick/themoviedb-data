The music used in this work is the German folk song Ach, wie ist’s möglich dann. In Taiwan folk culture the song was often performed at funerals, an interesting and absurd contrast to the song’s original use in the 1935 German literary film as the soundtrack for a love story. So Zhang choreographs a dance performed to this German folk song about death.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/akTAglb7qeCoyoR1IZsmf6qSfrZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Si So Mi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhan Zhang-Xu","original_name":"Zhan Zhang-Xu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/63TvaGyLzyLOleeUzQ9PyazJ606.jpg","credit_id":"5cfe222a9251410c95b8b88b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/akTAglb7qeCoyoR1IZsmf6qSfrZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taipei Film Festival","release_date":"2018-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
