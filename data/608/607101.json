We are in a remote mountain village in Georgia. The light from the projector breaks the darkness: the children's first cinematic experience is about to begin. Among the kids are Iman and Eva, two Muslim girls, for whom the experience becomes a turning point and inspires them to pick up a camera and start filming their daily lives. The girls are growing up in a valley infested by radicalism, where most people live in constant fear that their relatives will sacrifice their lives in the name of God.","popularity":0.2638,"poster_path":"/xJCHWcaY0wskqmVKWZWIozjScqL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119297,"logo_path":null,"name":"LuFilms","origin_country":""},{"id":94045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmpunkt","origin_country":""},{"id":119298,"logo_path":"/3geMVLtHyvNXa51Iwq54wJiE8NX.png","name":"Nushi Film","origin_country":"GE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before Father Gets Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"Sanam Mama Dabrundeba","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mari Gulbiani","original_name":"Mari Gulbiani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf88e36c3a36806ee20f56e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330728,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleksandre Shervashidze","original_name":"Aleksandre Shervashidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf88ea4c3a3680b4e20cb54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tekla Machavariani","original_name":"Tekla Machavariani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf88e7dc3a3686bb320e8e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073646,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Graafland","original_name":"Nina Graafland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf88e680e0a2650bdcb7352","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8780240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGD52qy20auBMPkq2fmLT5c0Lfp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vOwde26PN8eMBtXU1FxTqghC7y5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrSTzd49JhmWpvCjChI0eOxHdRm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xJCHWcaY0wskqmVKWZWIozjScqL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dhr9ntLsQfiyc7Blpsy2lowSAW4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.579,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yV4AG2Q1RwN3quXegR5agtdJoMd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1738}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":204134,"name":"human interest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sarajewo Film Festival","release_date":"2018-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"„Before Father Gets Back” Official Trailer","key":"Azq1INVe_s0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-28T19:18:20.000Z","id":"5cf8ea459251416737bdc6d1"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Before Father Gets Back - Trailer","key":"278507176","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-07-05T14:51:15.000Z","id":"5cf8e8710e0a267617cc21fb"}]}}}
