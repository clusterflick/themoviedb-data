Addressing the inherent violence of the real and the simulated, as well as the dubious pleasure of witnessing, narratives of safety, risk and use-value are tested via 3D-rendered, plastic surrogates. Choreographed motion-studies and textual, Brechtian vignettes produce alternative translations and behaviors, both acceptable and indecent. Brunt Drama manipulates the slipperiness of affect-inducing data visualizations intended to ameliorate fear into consumption â€” presenting a simulation of the unrepresentable, visible from both sides of the screen.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brunt Drama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Lax","original_name":"Matthew Lax","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfd534b9251417a5bbc54c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Los Angeles Contemporary Archive ","release_date":"2018-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
