It is a documentation of George Segal creating the basic elements for one of his statues preceded by rare glimpses into his own private museum. Donna Kerness serves as his live model. Walter Gutman sits on a chair and walks around a bit, being that he produced the film. Helen Segal, personifying the ageless saying, \"behind every man there stands a woman,\" stands behind her man and also stands in front of him occasionally. The film is a unique invitation to view the hidden rituals of a famous artist and his infamous model, half naked, snowbound together on a lonely farm, with a silent wife and a notorious guest.","popularity":0.0939,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of the White People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Gutman","original_name":"Walter Gutman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbd92dc3a36856101f5f66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Kerness","original_name":"Donna Kerness","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/pCVIeMUjsOOrhj3r9UgrpVgHeW5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbd933c3a36856101f5f77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Segal","original_name":"George Segal","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbd9409251414ce3b97f33","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Segal","original_name":"Helen Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfbd94a9251411470b97378","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"5cfbd90dc3a36856101f5efe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0252515","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
