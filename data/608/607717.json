But the commander of the army has other ideas, and then the emperor returns, very much alive.  The inspired vision of director Walter Sutcliffe and designer Jon Bausor brings to life the humour and egomania of one of opera’s most outrageous leading women. The youthful Handel packed Agrippina with the full range of his astonishing imagination, setting a libretto at once hilarious, moving and clever. Handel’s music is bursting with originality and fun, as well as carefully considered moments of eye-watering beauty.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/1n9SSd5keJRbVyR4NsZsG7LjJuk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agrippina - The Grange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Riches","original_name":"Ashley Riches","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfd08f90e0a265ef8ce0c14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Bonitatibus","original_name":"Anna Bonitatibus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfd0900c3a3687f18216816","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raffaele Pe","original_name":"Raffaele Pe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfd09089251417a5bbbd1bd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefanie True","original_name":"Stefanie True","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfd090ec3a3684e0821d067","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Ainslie","original_name":"Christopher Ainslie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfd0913c3a368057f2268ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Otterburn","original_name":"Alex Otterburn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cfd091ac3a368057f2268b7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Sutcliffe","original_name":"Walter Sutcliffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfd09370e0a267617d5cd9c","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333272,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Howarth","original_name":"Robert Howarth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfd092a9251416f8ebcdde7","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1n9SSd5keJRbVyR4NsZsG7LjJuk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
