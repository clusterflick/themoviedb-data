It is seen under various light effects which create different colour and texture impressions. The timelessness of the monolith is suggested by negative colour, the result of using fine-grain Eastmancolour print stock in the camera, a slow speed material which required the intense Central Australian light for adequate exposure. A half-speed recording of the local bird call and insects contributes to the sense of cross eras. Human perception of time, colour and sound is questioned. As Einstein said: 'The distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion, even if a stubborn one.'","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/13ZlJqeu8nO6mO0AQbYNse02VTj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1977-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Uluru","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Cantrill","original_name":"Arthur Cantrill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf96d11c3a36806ee231b6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinne Cantrill","original_name":"Corinne Cantrill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf96d1cc3a3682c3e217ca1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0167774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vtgGvdDo2KFQetXTyYNqqVGnmVo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/13ZlJqeu8nO6mO0AQbYNse02VTj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/siQzQRI7bNitNNuBucB5obEq35k.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1372,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7TgCHnrIonQTk4YTO3aUyf5ZFTx.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":915}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Canberra School of Art","release_date":"1978-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
