Groucho played an \"old movie\" villain, who \"sported a long moustache and was clad in black\", while Chico was probably his \"chuckling [Italian] henchman\". Zeppo portrayed a playboy who was the owner of a nightclub in which most of the action took place, including \"a cabaret, [which allowed] the inclusion of a dance number\". The final shot showed Groucho \"in ball and chain, trudging slowly off into the gloaming\". Harpo, in a rare moment of romantic glory, gets the girl in the end.
