With exclusive access to the European parliamentâ€™s Brexit Steering Group, this revelatory fly on the wall documentary captures the internal workings of European negotiators as they deal with an increasingly beleaguered Britain. As Europe contends with a decidedly un-United Kingdom, the austere corridors and dim-lit offices of Brussels become the stage for a human drama of epic proportions; a fractured tale that is by turns exasperating, tragic and hilarious.","popularity":0.0681,"poster_path":"/t62bg6OI1gkVTH5ctuoZYA0sXO9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journeyman Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brexit: Behind Closed Doors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Brexit Behind Closed Doors","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lode Desmet","original_name":"Lode Desmet","popularity":0.2423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfa7aa39251411882cb2965","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew McKerlie","original_name":"Andrew McKerlie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfa7abbc3a36806ee264b97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10579944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t62bg6OI1gkVTH5ctuoZYA0sXO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
