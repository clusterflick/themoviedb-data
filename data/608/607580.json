Alix Olson is an internationally touring folk poet and progressive queer artist-activist. One part peace vigil, one part protest rally, and one part joyful raucous concert, Alix ignites audiences everywhere as she performs. A self-defined global patriot, Alix emboldens audiences with her quick wit and powerful humanitarian voice. This documentary highlights spoken-word performances from around the country and a plethora of behind the scenes glimpses at the search for independent thought, grassroots defiance, passionate connection, organic food and clean laundry.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/pUdIDlYwtdL8Jp9sbvGTublCpVM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Lane: On the Road with Folk Poet Alix Olson","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samantha Farinella","original_name":"Samantha Farinella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfc003d925141749ab9d350","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0933068","wikidata_id":"Q116978397","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pUdIDlYwtdL8Jp9sbvGTublCpVM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
