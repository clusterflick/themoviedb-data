The film argues that the act of purchasing is the strongest aphrodisiac in a capitalist society, leaving open the possibility that a solution to toppling capitalism is to shift our sexual desires from consumerism to personal freedom from the state.\r The film was created during a residency at Signal Culture using a modified Paik-Abe Raster Manipulation Unit. A running VHS tape was manipulated using a voltage-controlled eurorack modular synthesizer, allowing the object of desire to be distorted, picked apart, and reveal its true form of capitalist allure.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ldKM4KpiE00IJ8OdyD8o7gOtjGU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burning Desire in a Dollar Bill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Maturo","original_name":"Nick Maturo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f5fda8e72fe8005e39f1af","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Feulner","original_name":"Rob Feulner","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mm6iKUFnQMvbyVpczhFlX2prcAI.jpg","credit_id":"5cf96a0f92514153b7bd019c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldKM4KpiE00IJ8OdyD8o7gOtjGU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
