When the beautiful chanteuse Hung (Law Yim-hing) is forced to marry Commander Lau (Lau Hark-suen), her brother (Cheng Wai-sum) interferes but is brutally beaten to death. Hung also falls to her death when she tries to escape. The siblings are only hastily buried in a coffin home, which is haunted soon afterwards. Hung's lover Wong (Wong Chiu-mo) later sneaks into the haunted house hoping to see her for one last time; Lau, meanwhile, insists on inspecting the coffin home and the corpses to prove that ghosts do not exist…The film creates an eerie and uncanny atmosphere with its well-designed camera angles, sound and editing. The haunting looks of the two ghost characters are a nod to Hong Kong's typically told horror stories.","popularity":0.4692,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":180073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changxing Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1955-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stealing the Beauty's Corpse at Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"夜盜艷屍","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Ye dao mei ren shi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Law Yim-Hing","original_name":"Law Yim-Hing","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/fcMqjVfsK5pQMiabjf1y8RUro2t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lee Siu-Hung","credit_id":"62ee97a011c066007c50d615","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Chiu-Miu","original_name":"Wong Chiu-Miu","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hung's lover/ Wong","credit_id":"62ee97bb7d5504007e4b1060","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1699270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Siu-Kam","original_name":"Leung Siu-Kam","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lau Chui-Kam","credit_id":"62ee97cc7d550400831f2a94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lau Hak-Suen","original_name":"Lau Hak-Suen","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/oF9aJ8cA0FUKnZ6d8tSZ9Lj5scS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Commander Lau","credit_id":"62ee97db7d5504007bb6a6a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheng Wai-Sum","original_name":"Cheng Wai-Sum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lee Ta-Hung","credit_id":"62ee97ea11c066009307b58f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ko Lo-Chuen","original_name":"Ko Lo-Chuen","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":"/wzkaGQ9BFH3YILSeR9k7ygSR4Xe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62ee97f4176a940081bc4265","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chow Gat","original_name":"Chow Gat","popularity":0.1024,"profile_path":"/xcZ3u7PI9DdrEvviQLZGOeGffyZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kam Bo","credit_id":"62ee9804176a94007eec2a81","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1716206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chang Yang","original_name":"Chang Yang","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee98507d5504007bb6a6bf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3652873,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chiu Shu-Pui","original_name":"Chiu Shu-Pui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee98679369a20091843007","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1789328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hsieh Hung","original_name":"Hsieh Hung","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee98359369a2007dc2419b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10224,"name":"haunting"},{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":204242,"name":"forced marriage"},{"id":240485,"name":"brother sister relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1955-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
