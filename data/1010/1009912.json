July 1988: to pay tribute to the memory of his friend Gaston, now deceased, Maurice Baquet once again climbed this wall suspended between heaven and earth with the man who, 50 years his junior, is considered one of his best contemporary mountaineers: Christophe Profit.","popularity":0.3986,"poster_path":"/vt6vfWVEgdHjFFQym5VvWxp91r8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baquet's Comeback","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Baquet","original_name":"Maurice Baquet","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/6IiqVtD7j0yiURxOnNTzo2hOZQG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f0f3feaf959000826b070d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3382549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Profit","original_name":"Christophe Profit","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/kqSVWO5FP135lmu7QEHOQYnZB9E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f0f409813cb6007b3409e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"62f0f417a1074b00920f91f2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Philibert","original_name":"Nicolas Philibert","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/q7ASsK57FAHKyIWi58Iyb0h7Znp.jpg","credit_id":"62f0f3e61f748b007cc8e124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11845926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qL1XxRZxKOnw24My5JLUJM82VFv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/afeBpOE3IIRPPeQEUnFRXHuvmsW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9gTLsIhJUw1cOq4vhiLLaGsjoW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwHAeDXwCrktdlm1KXNZ1t8Pmbh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wUUHTfB0uLibEnva7AeiNf33hf6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/onip2DkXYvtvhzqRzZAoQBykuRF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bk1zEzGab3JYPNHndj6Zumfcpme.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qxlOld9Xo3rt3tIlj5vnB7NeW09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5xGp4d48RTsRnMVKRhzlnfDXOQT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vVuQdQvMYWbDMKndVwH3gWmxJyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qk7tHrLixU0oR8sumqiWxN1diqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vt6vfWVEgdHjFFQym5VvWxp91r8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxM2AfsJ4jR6xfaY3NgI1s3fJxY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":209282,"name":"french alps"},{"id":266669,"name":"alpes"},{"id":307663,"name":"mountain pioneer"},{"id":320901,"name":"maurice baquet"},{"id":320902,"name":"violoncelle"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
