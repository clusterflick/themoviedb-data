The program charts his rise from bar-room crooner to the extraordinary performer, songwriter and vocalist he had become by the early part of the 1980s. Showing also how he developed as a scintillating raconteur, how he was more than willing to draw on a vast range of unorthodox influences, and how his records progressed in sophistication exponentially during the course of a decade, this film is the most detailed, enlightening and downright entertaining film ever to have emerged on this legendary artist.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/20j6dpcYJve1iKvXPkje4koGrMv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Waits Under Review 1971-1982","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Johnstone","original_name":"Rob Johnstone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f0caf1df857c0082467813","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ed \"Cooter\" Haynes","original_name":"Ed \"Cooter\" Haynes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f0caccdf857c007fb06086","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Cleland","original_name":"Andy Cleland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f0cae41f748b008487583f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6019938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1133,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/20j6dpcYJve1iKvXPkje4koGrMv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
