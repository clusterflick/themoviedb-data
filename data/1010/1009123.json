An amusement park is set up in an alana in the fall, the plot is deserted in the winter, and in the spring it serves as a stadium where the school's gymnastics demonstrations take place, which during the Junta become another tool of disorientation from the regime. A composition of moments of life as it flows in one of the then less glittering corners of the capital, where a space acquires its own essence. The passage of time sculpts the character of a piece of land, leaving its marks on it, just as it would on a person. Moments of joy and vitality give way to a rainy melancholy, like mood swings at the change of seasons. Until interest, an external force, dissolves everything during the construction of a building. The end is inexorable and inevitable.","popularity":0.0905,"poster_path":"/oIIPVzZtxPDB0EwKZjyMaKP8Bbu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1971-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thodoros Maragos","original_name":"Θόδωρος Μαραγκός","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/obSwvn19Qxgm34rUpzc0tkcpzXq.jpg","credit_id":"62ee6bce7d5504007e4b05f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thodoros Maragos","original_name":"Θόδωρος Μαραγκός","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/obSwvn19Qxgm34rUpzc0tkcpzXq.jpg","credit_id":"62ee6c0b46aed4007fc8f2b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thodoros Maragos","original_name":"Θόδωρος Μαραγκός","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/obSwvn19Qxgm34rUpzc0tkcpzXq.jpg","credit_id":"62ee6beb11c066009307aa82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thodoros Maragos","original_name":"Θόδωρος Μαραγκός","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/obSwvn19Qxgm34rUpzc0tkcpzXq.jpg","credit_id":"62ee6bfbc4ad590082c65f36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/orZyYblkafjMvNFF7NxtE26wwn0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oIIPVzZtxPDB0EwKZjyMaKP8Bbu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"https://www.filmfestival.gr/el/movie-tdf/movie/14339","release_date":"1971-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
