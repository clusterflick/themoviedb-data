It is a wonderfully consistent mapping of the Acropolis space, in the objects, the spaces, the iconography, the connection with history and tradition. From the opening moments and the presentation of the complexity and specificity of the location of the Acropolis, and through the presentation of every impressive detail, but also of a wider artistic context, the film takes us on a journey through time connecting the centuries of glory of Athenian history with today, with the monument framed not only as the shining relic of an old civilization, but also in its current location, above a large, modern city.","popularity":0.044,"poster_path":"/7bm8PFwbT09IfeFIYopUh7vwEWp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1960-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acropolis of Athens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roviros Manthoulis","original_name":"Ροβήρος Μανθούλης","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee6da6813cb600806ce109","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560784,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fotis Mestheneos","original_name":"Fotis Mestheneos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee6def46aed4007aa3e3c8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iraklis Papadakis","original_name":"Ηρακλής Παπαδάκης","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee6e27140bad007a31b6a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roviros Manthoulis","original_name":"Ροβήρος Μανθούλης","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee6dca176a94007eec1fbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560784,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fotis Mestheneos","original_name":"Fotis Mestheneos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee6dff9369a20091842603","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roviros Manthoulis","original_name":"Ροβήρος Μανθούλης","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ee6dbb11c0660081144b06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ptf2RoNnGDGAXlvyc2vMVxGNco.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7bm8PFwbT09IfeFIYopUh7vwEWp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"https://www.filmfestival.gr/el/movie-tdf/movie/14342","release_date":"1960-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
