The pair seem unsure of what exactly they want from each other: due to former, unexplored traumas, Caroline wants commitment, but also feels repulsed by getting close to anyone; while Henriette is “crazy” about her other half, but struggles to connect in ways that don’t involve small-talk about kids’ movies. And at the same time, Henriette’s ex-partner Elle remains part of her life, causing her current significant-other to start asking questions.","popularity":0.079,"poster_path":"/5O4ThVbmbqO9mTdkgWdYHC6UgaX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let
