As a collection of stories – all verbatim – from waiting rooms, gynaecology chairs, abortion clinics, and bedrooms, the documentary bears witness to everyday acts of patriarchy and systemic violence. Adopting a poetic visual language, MATKA / POLKA breaks the taboo around the experiences, emotions and identity of Polish women who have faced the country's strict reproductive policy and social prejudices to make decisions about their own life and body.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3Qc40dUuPNdoxFzlrvTv70mXJN1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MATKA / POLKA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyna Dyląg","original_name":"Martyna Dyląg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62eed6ae813cb6009239f3d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justyna Taborska","original_name":"Justyna Taborska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62eed6b5d207f3007a0a30f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ania Ryń","original_name":"Ania Ryń","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62eed6be77e1f6007fccf13e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kornelia Płaszczymąka","original_name":"Kornelia Płaszczymąka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62eed6c577e1f6007fccf14d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Suchomska","original_name":"Joanna Suchomska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62eed687cee2f6007d345142","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Suchomska","original_name":"Joanna Suchomska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62eed69dc4ad59007a14ffe5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Qc40dUuPNdoxFzlrvTv70mXJN1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
