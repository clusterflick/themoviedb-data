From the trials, tribulations, and trauma of being ‘different’ to her peers, to the unconditional allyship shown by those close to her, this is an emotional story about self-discovery, acceptance, courage, and first love.","popularity":0.0941,"poster_path":"/yBIHDnDsBDo7nNTpFveEdhpibp7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hey
