He's not impressed with his tutor Henry, who seems to have the values and attitudes of a 1930's aviator. The duo soon find themselves in all kinds of trouble though when Henry's famed past lands them as unwilling contestants on a sadistic game show. They escape through cunning and skill, which ends in a climactic and spectacular space battle. Upon watching Henry really fly his ship, Taylor begins to have a new founded respect for him.","popularity":0.4983,"poster_path":"/t9iaOL482D7Aj724RGkE4su61wS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Frightened of flying?
