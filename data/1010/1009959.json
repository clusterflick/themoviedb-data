A stream of abstract, deep and dense images and sounds evolves from a realistic image. The images are transparent, high in resolution and fine in detail. A process of multiple metamorphoses in several parallel spaces and time-layers constantly transforms their consistency, viscosity and transparency. The permeation, stacking and re-visualisation of such layers is almost symphonic, but does not separate areas of certain characteristics into chapters or movements.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DRIFT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulf Langheinrich","original_name":"Ulf Langheinrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f10eb81f748b007cc8ee6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
