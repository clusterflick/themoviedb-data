While Howe first made his name with classical depictions of life in the American West, after he came out as a gay man, he began a series of paintings which focused on images of the male form. Howe returned to his home town to show \"Stations: A Gay Passion,\" a collection of paintings that blended biblical images with depictions of homosexual eroticism, at a local museum. As might have been expected, the exhibit was the subject of protests from the Christian Evangelical community, and The Truth or Consequences of Delmas Howe is a documentary which explores Howe's life, his work, and the controversy it has generated.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/zv7Y8CqhKYBaAGJjwj6NCycMtO8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Truth or Consequences of Delmas Howe","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delmas Howe","original_name":"Delmas Howe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62ef0c6011c066007c50f0e1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3653400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Sneddon","original_name":"Matt Sneddon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ef0c4251a64e00805f2941","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0418257","wikidata_id":"Q3989711","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zv7Y8CqhKYBaAGJjwj6NCycMtO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
