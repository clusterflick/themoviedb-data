She has everything going for her: she's popular at school, she's got a great job at the local diner, she's got college to look forward to in a few months. What more could a girl ask for? Love? She has that too, the two people Emma loves the most: her step-brother, Chad, and her best friend, Brittany, also love her. She lives the ideal life in a suburban neighbourhood, surrounded by love and acceptance, but she has one problem that keeps her from being seen as \"normal,\" she suffers from insomnia that distorts reality from dreams.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/keK5IL7SXnrJvWy4MqcrR35ewSv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111525,"logo_path":"/q1inwlfDFAMCBcJ3MAWiYBCvYzR.png","name":"MissaX","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insomniac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1864757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Hix","original_name":"Emma Hix","popularity":17.461,"profile_path":"/b6cmbK5ibn1GtxZw46A7pFEzWmG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62ee6bed514c4a007ab4fca8","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2030353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Britney Light","original_name":"Britney Light","popularity":4.526,"profile_path":"/iHIe4rNt7JeyGbkkz3ZN9ZnSMTf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62ee6bfe514c4a007ab4fcae","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1328870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad White","original_name":"Chad White","popularity":3.245,"profile_path":"/aEOZfgfTPvfsEW7JETl7wTAYYea.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62ee6c13176a9400864494dd","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1102224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Pax","original_name":"Penny Pax","popularity":14.319,"profile_path":"/nSbrOhVWcOhd6QYHAbxi9V9wX9T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Psychiatrist","credit_id":"62ee6c247d550400831f1ee4","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15577038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/keK5IL7SXnrJvWy4MqcrR35ewSv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4142,"name":"insomnia"},{"id":196691,"name":"stepsister"},{"id":295880,"name":"family roleplay"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
