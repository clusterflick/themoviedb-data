Among various indigenous peoples, difference is far from being perceived as a handicap and is rather seen as a strength from which the whole community can benefit. In the era of reconciliation, Indigenous peoples are reclaiming their traditional knowledge and philosophies. Through intimate encounters with several people from the communities of Pessamit (Innu) and Manawan (Atikamekw), the film reveals how neurodiversity is perceived and experienced there, and how we can rethink the accompaniment of these young people by reconnecting with traditional philosophies of First Nations.","popularity":0.1254,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104613,"logo_path":"/oQFsGgUZK1C5Lk5FXtQevYKHqSu.png","name":"Terre Innue","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Pîtoteyihtam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1979715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","original_name":"Kim O'Bomsawin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1XpngtObJiZv0rM08bBU3HkiSOx.jpg","credit_id":"62f0028ed207f3007fcfec7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2437427,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florence Migneault","original_name":"Florence Migneault","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f002ab813cb6007b33bd06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3654358,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Widia Larivière","original_name":"Widia Larivière","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f0029df1b57100820d3751","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
