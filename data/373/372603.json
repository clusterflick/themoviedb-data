Matters are complicated by the fact that, several years later, one of the sons wants to turn the paper from its position as a hard-fighting champion of the working-class into an upscale society paper catering to the rich and powerful. Matters are complicated even further by rumors that their father was in fact NOT killed in France during the war but took another man's identity and is still living there.","popularity":0.8298,"poster_path":"/otEpm4e0GPHw4BIxxUqJfLORlOP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chesterfield Motion Pictures Corporation (I)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quitter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Grapewin","original_name":"Charley Grapewin","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/xROPwMkTUgweYQFhbTsvklIMhlw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ed Tilford","credit_id":"566f0d6b92514169e2010105","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Dunn","original_name":"Emma Dunn","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":"/gg8SC7cBPYWzGqjYSJ3qWcpy0vI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cordelia Tilford","credit_id":"566f0d7e92514169e2010108","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bakewell","original_name":"William Bakewell","popularity":0.2379,"profile_path":"/aQaCjcPXFBsoFRlZ0esLW7TxcZn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Russell Tilford","credit_id":"566f0d8e92514173ff013ec3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Weeks","original_name":"Barbara Weeks","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/cWs02tYEB96TKeQSlTWQl7NZILf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Diana Winthrop","credit_id":"566f0d9bc3a3682e9800f856","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hale Hamilton","original_name":"Hale Hamilton","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/fQbwcHY7KLdylzv5ThMG1qKuKGK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maj.
