It was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award.  It is about a small private collection of the British radio DJ John Peel who died in 2004 at the age of 65. Peel's main archive contained more than 100,000 vinyl records and CDs. This smaller private collection, however, contains 143 singles - some of them doublettes - stored in a private wooden box representing some of his personal favourites. According to the documentary, there are no singles by Peel's favorite group, The Fall, because he kept them in a separate box.  The film features interviews with John's wife Sheila Ravenscroft, radio DJs and artists like Mary Anne Hobbs, Sir Elton John, Ronnie Wood, Roger Daltrey, Fergal Sharkey, Jack White, Michael Palin and Miki Berenyi.","popularity":1.5331,"poster_path":"/mJb3JGjT5VUzE7Vzk2fgXDU1mMT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Peel's Record Box","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Peel","original_name":"John Peel","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/o1piv4P3TNObX7Hr34jbxANr62I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5fb8f20cbe6d88003f30d03c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elton John","original_name":"Elton John","popularity":0.9181,"profile_path":"/9G3k29OWPyZtScEDZEAsFJpqiM7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f213519bbb003cef4295","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gambaccini","original_name":"Paul Gambaccini","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/28KmXueehUDy8CdXB6q9zYugd2G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f2265aadc4003dfc580f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Parfitt","original_name":"Rick Parfitt","popularity":0.1743,"profile_path":"/hy4TdvDhbOApddG0Z16qj1zTZBy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f3aee10f46004009a809","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":220875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Rossi","original_name":"Francis Rossi","popularity":0.204,"profile_path":"/9BCWTwUYE9XX1L5i7BzfdrQefFx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f3b3519bbb003eef06f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feargal Sharkey","original_name":"Feargal Sharkey","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/lmksrM6NtlPszBwWeLiouy0GZ3k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f3e1d9f4a60042031f6c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Anne Hobbs","original_name":"Mary Anne Hobbs","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/uanDVbz3tJ5UBQNBTBKhblTlH1g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f3ec87ae7b003c50e411","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034587,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Ravenscroft","original_name":"Alan Ravenscroft","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f3ffbe6d88003f30d267","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack White","original_name":"Jack White","popularity":0.5088,"profile_path":"/cqn3AKfLGtzKBsXHqHM3W5HNVeI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f40c7d55040041e5362d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Morley","original_name":"Paul Morley","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/6KntxTaezEffK2QATUghbCSZlW6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f418a24c5000402f298c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Palin","original_name":"Michael Palin","popularity":1.0055,"profile_path":"/7qCp6M2NxMWpUmO2t6IqHGNlBjz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f45288c65900400985e0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Wood","original_name":"Ronnie Wood","popularity":0.3169,"profile_path":"/x9cPzzqEOLIuvwsqfqoDTdXeeny.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f48b3c887d003ea768be","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Daltrey","original_name":"Roger Daltrey","popularity":0.7913,"profile_path":"/wQUIoUytxAoqaMpq2jW51v4CLhJ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f4957d5504003fe5817c","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Anderson","original_name":"Laurie Anderson","popularity":0.2461,"profile_path":"/qzYxlXRWKJSa8Qbwt4bcaaUVtle.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fb8f5057d5504003fe581b4","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark E.
