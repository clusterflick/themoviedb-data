We'll voyage back in time to investigate the violent events that profoundly shaped the planets, including earth itself. We'll witness stunning revelations about what transformed Mars into a barren, hostile desert; the disaster that changed Venus from temperate to hellish; the impact that blew Mercury's mantle, turning it into a planetary core; a colossal disturbance that rearranged the orbits of the gas giants; titanic impacts on Jupiter, and how a lost moon may finally explain Saturn's rings.  Dynamically illustrated by spectacular NASA footage and cutting-edge CGI, THE UNIVERSE IN 3D tells the singular story of how our world came to be.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Universe in 3D Catastrophes That Changed the Planets","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2117079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Thompson","original_name":"Eric Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5b85875092514159dd058036","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Filippenko","original_name":"Alex Filippenko","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b90e3e3c3a3682230009cf7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Denley","original_name":"Laura Denley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b90e3f3c3a368222200a962","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
