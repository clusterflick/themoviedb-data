Rehab chronicles their experiences in the center and follows them out into the less-supervised, far more dangerous, \"real\" world, riding the emotional tidal waves that accompany incremental progress and devastating relapses. The film offers a rare insider's look at the ups and downs of each addict's journey to stay clean.","popularity":0.1949,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rehab","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Okazaki","original_name":"Steven Okazaki","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/mMwfAicGthVZMS8i7qeeF4DjSMS.jpg","credit_id":"566f79c6c3a3682e9801088d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0455998","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
