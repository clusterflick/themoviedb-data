We'll voyage back in time to investigate the violent events that profoundly shaped the planets, including earth itself. We'll witness stunning revelations about what transformed Mars into a barren, hostile desert; the disaster that changed Venus from temperate to hellish; the impact that blew Mercury's mantle, turning it into a planetary core; a colossal disturbance that rearranged the orbits of the gas giants; titanic impacts on Jupiter, and how a lost moon may finally explain Saturn's rings.  Dynamically illustrated by spectacular NASA footage and cutting-edge CGI, THE UNIVERSE IN 3D tells the singular story of how our world came to be.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Universe 3D: Catastrophes That Changed the Planets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
