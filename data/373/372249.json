The party’s great success is generally regarded as a result of its leader’s demonic charisma. But this film doesn’t focus on Jörg Haider. Instead it gives a face to the people who make Haider’s election victories possible, taking a clear stance, yet refraining from commentary or judgement. It is up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions.","popularity":0.1828,"poster_path":"/oYfS14tdgNLVdU5Dw5RjWG6HItM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegro
