The day of the big stationary threshing machine is almost over, as the machine is pushed into obscurity by the combine harvester. But there are still parts of Canada where crops are gathered in the old-fashioned way as the men work out in the fields and the women manage the kitchen. This film offers a rare and charming glimpse into mid-20th-century rural and family life in Canada.","popularity":0.0703,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Country Threshing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Jour de battage","type":"Canada (French title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolf Koenig","original_name":"Wolf Koenig","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/lwUJrNgPIMytPg8FZzjDdHOwzNH.jpg","credit_id":"566a1a3e92514173fc0071d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":356422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roman Kroitor","original_name":"Roman Kroitor","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/UXB1hDtpvCaGUrf1PJ01IfZ7N7.jpg","credit_id":"566a1a55c3a3682e98002106","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolf Koenig","original_name":"Wolf Koenig","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/lwUJrNgPIMytPg8FZzjDdHOwzNH.jpg","credit_id":"566a19dc92514169e2002913","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547448,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Beveridge","original_name":"James Beveridge","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5Jf6HkeCd2aiLaQr22oT4k19Feb.jpg","credit_id":"566a1b5b92514169e2002971","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547447,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Roy","original_name":"Jean Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5fa455e375c000161c0cc5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020799,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Dufaux","original_name":"Georges Dufaux","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5fa44669d2804142006716","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","original_name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/dnGX2sB5M7pifl3JYT8qfKyE2MF.jpg","credit_id":"5d5fa463a894d644b59a8f56","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
