While the queen is hunting, her chick is killed by a knight who takes the jewel from the chick's heart and makes it into a necklace which he gives to his princess. The princess is turned into a dragon and forced to flee from the knight, meeting a young wizard and his familiar on the way. The wizard decides that the dragon princess needs to go to the mountain at the heart of the dragon kingdom, and they begin a long journey across the continent. The knight, who has trailed the princess to the mountain, severely injures her. In the process, the dragon necklace is severed, and the princess turns human again.
