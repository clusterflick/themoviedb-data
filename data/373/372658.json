A fable-musical-philosophical-chanchada\", Mautner says. He also affirms that the work focuses a lot on the longing for Brazil, on the will that the exiled had to return to their homeland. The idea came from conversations between the musician and his old father, \"always talking about the pre-Socratics\", he recalls. Glauber Rocha states that \"The Demiurge\" is the best film \"of\" and \"about\" exile.","popularity":0.1655,"poster_path":"/z60C9E3WV5QFO7XQJSyJsW04PXU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaos Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Demiurge","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Mautner","original_name":"Jorge Mautner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/tbofGnQIjko6xPq41PMrlweJO5W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Satã","credit_id":"566f81dec3a36834c1010cb4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3620,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Caetano Veloso","original_name":"Caetano Veloso","popularity":0.1753,"profile_path":"/pxKnrQ6fYE46xWt3lCdCKClUIiI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Demiurgo","credit_id":"566f81e7c3a368535a0126a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilberto Gil","original_name":"Gilberto Gil","popularity":0.6782,"profile_path":"/g7bsGKO5lBUzaqJEuOI51CKNtYW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pã","credit_id":"566f81f8c3a36836b40137ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1257306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gal Costa","original_name":"Gal Costa","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":"/qiWkOUsmh2HzcMdxztD4mEYr69c.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"566f823dc3a3682e98010a88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jards Macalé","original_name":"Jards Macalé","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/l17Q47N8dCE3BboQSTGXvG1ONJY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56701ae2c3a36833b6011b6e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Bengell","original_name":"Norma Bengell","popularity":0.2113,"profile_path":"/bZfE2pQ5y2bxHVR8rnV6KOSNGpM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57833494c3a36862ae006541","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656330,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gilberto Macedo","original_name":"Gilberto Macedo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61775d51a579f9002715cce8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Mautner","original_name":"Jorge Mautner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/tbofGnQIjko6xPq41PMrlweJO5W.jpg","credit_id":"566f81d59251415ec5010f0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Mautner","original_name":"Jorge Mautner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/tbofGnQIjko6xPq41PMrlweJO5W.jpg","credit_id":"566f81c9c3a368535a012699","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0325235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z60C9E3WV5QFO7XQJSyJsW04PXU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
