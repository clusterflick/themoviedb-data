We know virtually nothing about these lives, their innermost thoughts, their daily routine and their struggle to survive. Stigmatized by misleading and unfair descriptions, they are the dark and silent face of our society that we are gradually coming to accept. However, within them, they carry the desire for rebellion, their dreams, the lust for life and the words to express all that. Alone at their side, volunteers from charity organizations, a genuine shadow army, work selflessly for an idea of justice and the common good. Their united energies fuel the desire to go on living together and mark out a pathway of hope for all. Cinema's fragile gift is to place us at the heart of these fragments of existence, both offered to our gaze and yet so modest.","popularity":0.6467,"poster_path":"/dxsBIIv29xvQSNbpaGWyUejo9RJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Se battre","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4378561,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Courntin","original_name":"Bruno Courntin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6554fa51ac41610100712731","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":409525,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Duret","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Duret","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566d24619251412dbc0058c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Santana","original_name":"Andrea Santana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566d246bc3a36836b400dd83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3012592","wikidata_id":"Q16675894","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2394,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dxsBIIv29xvQSNbpaGWyUejo9RJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":292947,"name":"financial hardship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
