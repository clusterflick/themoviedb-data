When he impacts the strangerâ€™s world, he also impacts the heart and mind of someone else close by. With Gerard O'Dwyer in the leading role, Tracie Sammut as camera assistant, Georgia Cranko as unit manager and Gordon Crane as gaffer, the filmmaking experience of Be My Brother presented an opportunity for creative people with disabilities to experience working on a film set in the capacity of either crew member or performer.  Genevieve met Gerard while filming a documentary for Down Syndrome NSW, as part of the Up, Up and Away Project, and was instantly inspired by his vivacious personality and a photographic memory for dialogue. She decided to write a script for him to act as the lead, in order to create a platform to showcase his talent and ability as an actor.","popularity":0.2081,"poster_path":"/8yt5Ssy3007RD9RWEpC2tfimcH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be
