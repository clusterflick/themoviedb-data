Her parents attend to that for her. However, pretty little O Yama Sum had a will of her own, and casting tradition to the winds, insisted upon making her own choice. The Grand Daimio has long loved the pretty O Yama and presents himself before her mother in quest of her hand. His offer is scorned by O Yama, for she loves another, a low-born but worthy warrior.","popularity":0.4086,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart of O Yama","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Lawrence","original_name":"Florence Lawrence","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/gpjntjA0Kbit4MUcPMM4KBLicpw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"O'Yama","credit_id":"5670725392514169e2013d25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gebhardt","original_name":"George Gebhardt","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/yUsuLBxrWP6wO152fkS8ssHTmIg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"O'Yama's Lover","credit_id":"5670725bc3a368535a01546e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
