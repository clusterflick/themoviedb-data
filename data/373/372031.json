For more than 60 years Tibetans have been fighting Chinese oppression. But their non-violent struggle appears to be in vain. Now, as a new form of peaceful protest, Tibetans are setting themselves on fire. Loten Namling - an exiled Tibetan and musician living in Switzerland - is deeply disturbed by such self-destructive action. So he sets off from Europe to India, on a one-man mission to meet top politicians, experts and young radicals. He himself becomes increasingly radical and is on the verge of violent protest. Finally he ends up at The Office of the Dalai Lama in India to seek the advice of the exiled Tibetan leader.","popularity":0.724,"poster_path":"/zoqLAd0HPNpnzN0mcWLMV7W1X3q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97382,"logo_path":null,"name":"DokLab GMBH","origin_country":""},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tibetan Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loten Namling","original_name":"Loten Namling","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566a234092514173fc007469","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenzin Gyatso","original_name":"Tenzin Gyatso","popularity":0.162,"profile_path":"/dAtWYY56kQURZFKmdgrCTkakXTw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a0bf5ea9251414dd30091ca","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter von Siebenthal","original_name":"Peter von Siebenthal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633fecaaddd52d007c96d7a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2428275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Treichler","original_name":"Franz Treichler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633fecbe35a61e00792b724c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dodo Hunziker","original_name":"Dodo Hunziker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a23599251417383002861","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dodo Hunziker","original_name":"Dodo Hunziker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a2363c3a36834c1003170","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dodo Hunziker","original_name":"Dodo Hunziker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a2373c3a368535a002315","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Urs Augstburger","original_name":"Urs Augstburger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a238bc3a36833b6002f9c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547463,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marius Born","original_name":"Marius Born","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a239bc3a368535a002322","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Urs Schnell","original_name":"Urs Schnell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a23aa9251415ec5002d39","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547464,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pierre Reischer","original_name":"Pierre Reischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a23bfc3a3682e980023e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547465,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justin Cook","original_name":"Justin Cook","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/hD8SevZN9HLf4lapkdx9CHj16hi.jpg","credit_id":"566a23ed9251417383002885","department":"Production","job":"Publicist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4285612","wikidata_id":"Q90159433","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tcObM14Et7nV2BFI80YKACi28bk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zoqLAd0HPNpnzN0mcWLMV7W1X3q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4558,"name":"tibet"},{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn, 50.
