Normally, each individual frame of film depicts the entire space but only a moment in time (1/24 second). With tx-transformed films, it is just the opposite: each frame shows the entire time but only a tiny portion of space (the left side of the picture is \"before\", the right side is \"after\"). —Virgil Widrich","popularity":0.1229,"poster_path":"/rtzVsOZvPvvE30831bW1TmSdG1V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgil Widrich Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1998-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"tx-transform","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Jakob","original_name":"Enrico Jakob","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"567150f4c3a3680e7301160e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Kröncke","original_name":"Heinrich Kröncke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"567150fdc3a3683f56015656","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Ladstätter","original_name":"Florian Ladstätter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56715105c3a3682647015b3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Mayer","original_name":"Horst Mayer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5671510d92514143ad00628d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Reisinger","original_name":"Hans Reisinger","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56715119925141500100fae9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Reisinger","original_name":"Thomas Reisinger","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56715122c3a3683f5601565c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Reinhart","original_name":"Martin Reinhart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5671513392514169e2015e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virgil Widrich","original_name":"Virgil Widrich","popularity":0.2702,"profile_path":"/v9191SgfSi9yCIYmLLquBrWlfQm.jpg","credit_id":"5671513f92514143ad006293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133249","wikidata_id":"Q3542620","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rtzVsOZvPvvE30831bW1TmSdG1V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
