To her son Charles, a wild but kind young fellow, she leaves a small amount, feeling that he will soon run through it. The good-hearted boy is perfectly satisfied, believing in the wisdom of his mother's actions. He assumes she will find a home with one of his siblings, who are married and settled. The old woman moves in with her married son, but is driven out by his wife over an argument about her young granddaughter. She is forced to move into a squalid apartment in a cheap tenement house, but is evicted for failing to pay her rent. Mack Sennett appears as a bartender in this film.","popularity":0.2568,"poster_path":"/4gQdQ1gjB6hH03Ut3J858BES5Uu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over the Hills to the Poor House","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Over the Hill to the Poorhouse","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Auer","original_name":"Florence Auer","popularity":0.1698,"profile_path":"/82nUuX7cDdfFxfZ2bIC063Hmt2Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Old Woman","credit_id":"5670454892514169e20130c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dillon","original_name":"Edward Dillon","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/lRWa2M2guVQUo4GCMPComWsds79.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Son","credit_id":"5670452a925141664f012b65","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wallace McCutcheon Jr.","original_name":"Wallace McCutcheon Jr.","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61edf937cd2046001b6750a8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony O'Sullivan","original_name":"Anthony O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bailiff","credit_id":"5670453fc3a36834c10127c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"56704534c3a36834c10127bc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert G.
