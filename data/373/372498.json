Enjoy many of the great moments in Houston's baseball history including Ken Johnson's no-hitter, which he lost, Don Wilson's spectacular performances on the mound, and Nolan Ryan's triumph in overtaking Walter Johnson's strikeout record, just to name a few.  Relive the story of the Astros as told by the stars who experienced it: like Rusty Staub, Joe Morgan and Mike Scott. From an expansion team in 1962 to today's National League Western Division Champions, \"A Silver Odyssey\" captures a quarter-century of history, humor and excitement.","popularity":0.8124,"poster_path":"/d0UXS7DHQy5QKe4jVXbKbDMkzji.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69930,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Phoenix Communications Group","origin_country":""},{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A look at a quarter-century of Houston baseball, from the Colt .45s to the 1986 Western Division Champions","title":"A Silver Odyssey: 25 Years of Houston Astros Baseball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.D.
