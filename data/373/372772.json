Yet, despite the fact that the author's publisher was Bobbs Merrill, a major literary brand, the book never reached the public domain. Little did the professor know there were powerful forces working behind the scenes to prevent its release. He would later discover that through its ties to ITT, a major shareholder in Bobbs Merrill, the Central Intelligence Agency was able to suppress the book.","popularity":0.3152,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guerrilla News Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guerrilla News Network: The War Conspiracy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Dale Scott","original_name":"Peter Dale Scott","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iFihPdwibgQ2AmfomLHQH0UD4sn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"567090ca92514143ad00489b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":272812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Marshall","original_name":"Stephen Marshall","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5670907692514143ad004888","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0303343","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":591,"name":"central intelligence agency (cia)"},{"id":4934,"name":"theory"},{"id":10410,"name":"conspiracy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
