She, however, ignores him - at least until she sees him carrying a baby. Suddenly, the single woman, otherwise so cool, gets interested in Leo who, in turn, scents that this is his big chance. He is rather sure that he will be able to win her over to his side with the help of the baby and his pioneering plan against traffic jams which he wants to introduce to her in a presentation. But there is a small problem: Little Felix is not his son.","popularity":0.2929,"poster_path":"/6oMxDsBGpBA2zZOxFLXctbZVlhu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Baby zum Verlieben","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anica Dobra","original_name":"Anica Dobra","popularity":0.3218,"profile_path":"/lji5oIp65xoMblT0XnlKI1O35Es.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Antonia Sandmann","credit_id":"56849342c3a36836280013a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernhard Schir","original_name":"Bernhard Schir","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/2HftDJxOoEWnxUgjWlhxtdHbHCf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leo Fink","credit_id":"568493579251417e630013b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Landuris","original_name":"Dieter Landuris","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/5bEiLjBk73T03NqsYJI8ZoSASYM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stefan Grenz","credit_id":"56849377c3a36828f500f8e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Müller-Elmau","original_name":"Katharina Müller-Elmau","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/nKTkN16VXp1wHo6Z7eL61PheW02.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Vera Becker","credit_id":"56849387c3a3686075018a51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Gertsch","original_name":"Max Gertsch","popularity":0.1567,"profile_path":"/aOxx0b2wSMklvDlRit0SP4aJtyo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Georg Kriewitz jr.","credit_id":"5684939cc3a3684be9018ef9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maren Kroymann","original_name":"Maren Kroymann","popularity":0.3503,"profile_path":"/5E6tcI9S597TzyQY8nwLLhyb55V.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hilda","credit_id":"568493a99251411334010dc8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hartmut Griesmayr","original_name":"Hartmut Griesmayr","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5684932ec3a36860e9019740","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0426944","wikidata_id":"Q16681770","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6oMxDsBGpBA2zZOxFLXctbZVlhu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
