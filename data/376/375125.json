His problem is the eyeballs – not the normal pair, but the additional pair that pops up from his nose whenever he gets nervous. Needless to say, girls usually run away screaming.Tashiro is a fanboy director whose films are full of references (e.g. Kotaro gets self-confidence by watching The Toxic Avenger on VHS) and insider jokes. There’s also an amazing cameo at the end of the film.","popularity":0.5351,"poster_path":"/4dHi3bv237f6cTFLGs07cKdbAzv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2015-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Use the Eyeballs!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"鼻目玉幸太郎の恋！","type":"Original"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akihisa Shiono","original_name":"塩野瑛久","popularity":0.8702,"profile_path":"/5nHFqXFEoxRAezNeg3PWEeEkel.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5684badac3a36828f501016b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":556076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rina Akiyama","original_name":"秋山莉奈","popularity":0.9986,"profile_path":"/z56gOiQPgsDPQba3xszmmVCmaCy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5684baf6c3a3684bcc01b8c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eihi Shiina","original_name":"椎名英姫","popularity":0.717,"profile_path":"/lvYA0osYgmCwluaURsnk0TE8vfs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5684bb08c3a36860e9019fee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asami","original_name":"亜紗美","popularity":0.8748,"profile_path":"/qHWRewySoNrswmTYzrrPtTkZJVZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5684bb17c3a3684bcc01b8cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kentarō Shimazu","original_name":"島津健太郎","popularity":0.3727,"profile_path":"/4CIlI7IFNZlv9AapJrguXU6yriu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5684bb2d9251412e52018b6c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoya Tashiro","original_name":"Naoya Tashiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5684b9bbc3a3683628001c40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76177,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yasutaka Nagano","original_name":"長野泰隆","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645d3100156cc7013ff3bafa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4dHi3bv237f6cTFLGs07cKdbAzv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
