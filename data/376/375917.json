She deeply misses the loving environment of the reserve she once called home, and her isolation is sharpened by her father’s serious illness. When Wato’s teacher reads from a history book describing First Nations peoples as ignorant and cruel, it aggravates her classmates’ prejudice. Shy and vulnerable Wato becomes the target of their bullying and abuse. Alone in her suffering, she finds solace and strength in the protective world of her magical dreams.","popularity":0.159,"poster_path":"/bFIE8EQ4vQox4ZkaEWmxmNPOVmx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When All the Leaves Are Gone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Quand toutes les feuilles seront tombées","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosalie Dumas","original_name":"Rosalie Dumas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Wato","credit_id":"568abc73c3a3680e010053d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1875589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Josée Corneau","original_name":"Marie-Josée Corneau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sq9Pr1vbrVwvFASEWPArcmcKaZ8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"599e5877c3a3685a5800589d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justine Rolland","original_name":"Justine Rolland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Student","credit_id":"5d05d64c92514104c4bac244","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphnée Vincent","original_name":"Daphnée Vincent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Student","credit_id":"5d05d66092514110b7b89702","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margie Hoff","original_name":"Margie Hoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Old Aunt","credit_id":"5d05d669c3a368445b2c3661","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"568abc859251414ecb01cf10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"568abc7e9251417c06003cbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"568abc57c3a36860e902bb65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497432,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alison Burns","original_name":"Alison Burns","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d05d6c892514163d1becbe4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8281898","wikidata_id":"Q59617078","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gWp0fSZzVUXwUXeHBbqFegS1CQd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bFIE8EQ4vQox4ZkaEWmxmNPOVmx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/prbF8XwghlgVvCvEuI0WYmvmIKt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
