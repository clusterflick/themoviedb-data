Though also acclaimed in Taiwan and mainland China for seminal works like the essay Shops, her writings are firmly rooted in the spirit of Hong Kong. Leave it to Fruit Chan, another staunchly grassroots auteur, to make a documentary on Xi Xi's career. Chan sought out renowned critics and writers to discuss Xi Xi's works, starting with 1979's My City. He also juxtaposes photos of a changing Hong Kong with readings of her writings, and even playfully inserts characters from her stories into the film.","popularity":0.1141,"poster_path":"/tryTy4N456mVV0OLKvsM04AGrde.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2015-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inspired Island: My City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fruit Chan","original_name":"陳果","popularity":0.4401,"profile_path":"/j1Xktbs6M6kNIwaLUps9swSEdVs.jpg","credit_id":"5687e88692514132db02165f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4569938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.646,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tryTy4N456mVV0OLKvsM04AGrde.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":646}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2132,"name":"literature"},{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
