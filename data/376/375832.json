The solo exhibition features a spatial narrative installation that delves, through movement, texture, sound, and gesture, into the psychology of a recurring figure in Bass' previous films; while also introducing two new characters, blending the past into the present. Bass has designed the installation by altering the gallery, leading the viewer through a evocative memory of place, embedding us in a timeless society of lost souls in a haunted landscape.  -Allison Peters Quinn, Exhibition Director, Hyde Park Art Center","popularity":0.3293,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Latest Sun Is Sinking Fast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Stambaugh","original_name":"Sarah Stambaugh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5689c52dc3a3683628010e9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Saner","original_name":"Bryan Saner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5689c53692514132db026953","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Goulish","original_name":"Matthew Goulish","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5689c55c9251414ecb019f5d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1557784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melika Bass","original_name":"Melika Bass","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/t6tgck943gpkptV9VdRaHT7hZ4G.jpg","credit_id":"5689c599c3a3684bcc02a6f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1557784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melika Bass","original_name":"Melika Bass","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/t6tgck943gpkptV9VdRaHT7hZ4G.jpg","credit_id":"5689c5159251412e52026fb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158697,"name":"installation"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
