A new clue to its location is discovered, sending two different teams on illegal digs. Terra Green assembles a professional team of specialists while a separate team led by sisters Riley and Bibi Cross use their father's 40 years of research to hunt after his untimely death. On different sides of the island, both teams believe they have found the point where X marks the spot on the map, but their illegal digs have put them all in danger from a variety of enemies, all whom covet the treasure.","popularity":0.4521,"poster_path":"/xkJyJ3Zwlubg6Y06gcD1oFyGGlL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magic Elevator","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treasure Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Santander","original_name":"Martin Santander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Senator Mendoza","credit_id":"568800b0925141133401a55c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1526179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irit Hoffenberg","original_name":"Irit Hoffenberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kerri-Ann Kors","credit_id":"568800c5c3a3685f8900e3d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Hansen","original_name":"Omar Hansen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aston Smith","credit_id":"568800d99251417e6300b4e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1557066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Sturman","original_name":"Alex Sturman","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/6lOUzD0WvCgdYmSEcIG0p2wUjx6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bibi Cross","credit_id":"568800eec3a368227b018cbf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1526177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Marie Curran","original_name":"Anita Marie Curran","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Riley Cross","credit_id":"5688010792514131df0209d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frezno Iam","original_name":"Frezno Iam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Thomas Steel","credit_id":"56880137c3a3684bcc025505","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobbi D.
