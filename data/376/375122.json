In contrast to the bloodsucking practices found in the current fashion industry and its status quo, Orgdot’s goal was to establish a win-win platform for both the producer and the consumer. is about the dream of those who chose to bring such a challenging endeavor into their lives and the inevitable anxiety and conflict they faced because of it. However, the film is not about Millennials, the so-called anxiety generation, and its general fears, but about this one small group’s anxiety surrounding a chosen goal, one that lacks the security found in the accepted norm. The film is the second part of director Min Hwan-ki’s exploration of a generation’s place and latent power. sets out to chase down and analyze the struggle that follows the anxiety and, of course, express support for those choices.","popularity":0.1295,"poster_path":"/t8K1835aqluQosLzakaugSvzPDM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45370,"logo_path":"/9Ao9TsBhdKwE2cmaCFF69ACvEAz.png","name":"Indiestory","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":201610,"logo_path":null,"name":"1014
