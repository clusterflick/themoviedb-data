Based on Offenbach's meatier second version (1874) of the Orpheus legend, it features nicely judged performances across the board and some stunning special effects, notably the explosive locomotive crash signalling the breach of the divide between Heaven and Hell. Satire reigns, not least in the reactionary figure of Public Opinion, a pinny-clad bossy boots with a hint of Dame Edna Everage about her. Olympus is a moribund salon full of bored Gods, sick of the Ambrosian diet.","popularity":0.274,"poster_path":"/x9TYpfca3ADRBUplTFI4zjaqnUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72086,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie","origin_country":""},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1997-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orphée aux Enfers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Orphée aux Enfers (1997) Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandru Badea","original_name":"Alexandru Badea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Orphée","credit_id":"568700b592514132db01ea04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1556912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Vidal","original_name":"Elizabeth Vidal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/o28x1uGOD4nw79djb6iiIwTAvf0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eurydice","credit_id":"5687a2ffc3a368362800a987","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Duesing","original_name":"Dale Duesing","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/zM4E5HDkbplKe3XduKcKObKpcS2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jupiter","credit_id":"5687a30fc3a3684bcc0244f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinaldo Macias","original_name":"Reinaldo Macias","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/o5OvoTBnJCVxK3guD2bWH6dsesa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Astrée-Pluton","credit_id":"56977bee92514154db001c7c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Noëlle de Callataÿ","original_name":"Marie-Noëlle de Callataÿ","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qSRzNUhdMNPpVz9mz9o5JiPN1G8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cupidon","credit_id":"56977c1e92514154cf001eee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Jung","original_name":"André Jung","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/cdpmnYjpRZ8mecM24K5CVDo7c1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"John Styx","credit_id":"56977c3592514154d2001da1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desirée Meiser","original_name":"Desirée Meiser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5VNnAZ70DxMNTRA68ki3DfvuJbm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"L'Opinion Publique","credit_id":"56977c5292514154d5001f3d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Misonne","original_name":"Laurence Misonne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Minerve","credit_id":"56977c6592514154d8001ea7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Patzakis","original_name":"Michele Patzakis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oUdTeL2UKH1HYM8uhLfNs3rJbRp.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Vénus","credit_id":"56977c7c92514154d5001f4c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonja Theodoridou","original_name":"Sonja Theodoridou","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/eHvX3roSi8jqCOMb8yaY1bO06RL.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"56977c8d92514154d5001f54","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline van Quaille","original_name":"Jacqueline van Quaille","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iKoycuGXJcWSbhO9gxoma85STK9.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Junon","credit_id":"56977ca292514154cf001f06","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franck Cassard","original_name":"Franck Cassard","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/f4fzI02HgEydYR9OypxGk1uYgxW.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mercure","credit_id":"56977cd192514154cf001f10","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Offenbach","original_name":"Jacques Offenbach","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/iVnjK1OhWwrkptwNCgPfZTDTyyi.jpg","credit_id":"5687006292514131df01dad0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Barbier","original_name":"Jules Barbier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zhVqhaYv2vyzWFHZCuno5iDZPHz.jpg","credit_id":"56977f3292514154db001cf1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139865,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"E.
