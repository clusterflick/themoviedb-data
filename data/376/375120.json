She accepted this marriage because the man she loved, Augustin, left. Jean-Luc knows this but he hopes that the birth of a child will allow them to live together possible. Unfortunately, daily life between work in the fields and Sunday mass destroys their understanding. After Augustin's return, Christine becomes his mistress and Jean-Luc discovers it. He chases Christine away and remains alone with their child but the latter drowns shortly after in a pond. Refusing to believe in the death of his son, Jean-Luc descends into madness.
