Papageno the bird-catcher arrives and claims he killed the serpent, but the outraged Ladies padlock Papageno's mouth for his lie. They also show Tamino a portrait of Princess Pamina, the Queen's kidnapped daughter, and he immediately falls in love. Protected by a golden flute, he sets off with the bird-catcher Papageno to rescue Pamina from the clutches of the sorcerer Sarastro and a madcap adventure involving magicians, wild animals and very Masonic-like trials. Triumphing over all adversity, the lovers unite, as the forces of light banish the darkness and Papageno even finds a true love of his own.","popularity":0.1266,"poster_path":"/yEkGMv8t1mlQJqR7m6MrRZWpxIV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":163,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Zauberflöte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1562710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felicity Lott","original_name":"Felicity Lott","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":"/pOhLFyNbzewts44FBEVQXHBeZd9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pamina","credit_id":"56958cef9251413af0000dd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Goeke","original_name":"Leo Goeke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tamino","credit_id":"5687ae309251414ecb0141f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Thomaschke","original_name":"Thomas Thomaschke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarastro","credit_id":"5687ae429251417e1500a525","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"5687ae059251412e52021373","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yEkGMv8t1mlQJqR7m6MrRZWpxIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
