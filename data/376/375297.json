But deep down she'd love to have her own family. Then she meets Fritz Mertens: a newly-divorced dentist open to new relationships--but with no strings attached, please. He has enough of those already in the shape of his 12-year-old son Vincent, who lives part-time with him and part-time with his mother in Munich. Sophie and Fritz fall in love, but can there be a future for a \"second-hand\" man and a woman with her own hopes for happiness?","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/iXnUsjGohLrEOBD2uWyLg4kY3YI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mein
