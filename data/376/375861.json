Originally released by Mattel, the Power Glove was the first mass-marketed gesture-based video game controller.  It was designed by an eclectic team of hard-working and bright-eyed dreamers, and its marketing hype was immense.  Immediately after its release, however, gamers were disappointed by the Power Glove, and critics panned it as a worthless gimmick.  Yet unlike many gimmicks and critical failures of the past, the Power Glove has not been simply swept under the rug.  Nearly three decades after its release, the Power Glove continues to resonate with video gaming and technology fans, becoming the focus of art pieces, songs, videos, hacking projects, and other forms of cultural repurposing.  “The Power of Glove” tells the story of how and why the Power Glove lives on.","popularity":0.5874,"poster_path":"/1ahPDJNAABjmkJx68fVYi4CmDLQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Command International Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Power Glove Documentary","title":"The Power of Glove","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Garton","original_name":"Brad Garton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a22f97d92514103240b8f61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tracy Hall","original_name":"Tracy Hall","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a22f99792514103390b9f5a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaiah TriForce Johnson","original_name":"Isaiah TriForce Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a22f9c1c3a3680b8f0ba6e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan McMillian","original_name":"Dan McMillian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a22f9ca92514103360bc194","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Novak","original_name":"William Novak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a22f9d192514103330b8444","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1557997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Ward","original_name":"Adam Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6iml74EhMIPd3RUkNtmMuVmCguY.jpg","credit_id":"568a34b6c3a3680e01003fff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Austin","original_name":"Andrew Austin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6SPl8ISqoNgR84qPPMEBShhwLMo.jpg","credit_id":"5a22f0f40e0a264cc40b57d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1558000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Kosowski","original_name":"Paula Kosowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a22f46492514103330b7eb9","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1557997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Ward","original_name":"Adam Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6iml74EhMIPd3RUkNtmMuVmCguY.jpg","credit_id":"5a22f44bc3a3680b9d0b1bb9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Austin","original_name":"Andrew Austin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6SPl8ISqoNgR84qPPMEBShhwLMo.jpg","credit_id":"5a22f43dc3a3680b8d0b9ef4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam F.
