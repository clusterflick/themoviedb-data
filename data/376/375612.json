Nonetheless, when the youngest offspring moves out, a new chapter in life begins: They finally have plenty of time for each other and common dreams. At least that's the beautiful theory. Sabine and Bernd have to face the truth: unnoticed by the hustle and bustle of the family, they have drifted apart. Where the offspring once provided common ground, there is suddenly a yawning emptiness. The fact that other couples feel the same way after their children have moved out gives little consolation. And while Bernd continues to bury his head in the sand and hopes for the success of the \"sit out\" principle, Sabine gets serious. She gives Bernd an ultimatum. Because one thing is clear to them: just continuing like this is out of the question.","popularity":0.4588,"poster_path":"/4ZmonNvxF0ixtq7BvkmrbZS8tTn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eltern
