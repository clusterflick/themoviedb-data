When she confesses her desire for a child, Maxime panics. As a cartoonist by trade he is far from financially stable, so he outright rejects the idea of parenthood. What follows is a roller-coaster romance full of recriminations and reconciliations, until Maxime must ultimately decide whether his fear of becoming a parent is a reason to leave.","popularity":1.0144,"poster_path":"/a9xIIuRcrX0x8aeM94QH8hSBNAg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18108,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.P.F.I.","origin_country":""},{"id":51385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les
