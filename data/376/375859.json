It was 10 years ahead of its time, and ready to take on Microsoft, IBM and Apple for control of the PC market. The Amiga computer revolutionized video, multimedia and digital art, with Andy Warhol being a big advocate. It was also known for being a fantastic video games machine. Despite the computer's manufacturer going bankrupt in early 1990's, the Amiga has a huge cult following worldwide to this day. This film documents the rise and fall of the Amiga in the marketplace, and gives an inside look at the passionate and eccentric community that surrounds it.","popularity":0.5079,"poster_path":"/fQIbpzLSKXiZLtbN1OHCCeNEX04.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viva Amiga","video":false,"vote_average":5.875,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Dickinson","original_name":"Trevor Dickinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58763a47c3a3682b2b008f93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1736966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert J.
