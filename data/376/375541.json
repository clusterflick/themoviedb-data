A city that rejects entropy, Tijuana constructs its own rules. Its denizens negotiate the chaos with fierce independence, ingenuity and a gift for improvisation. Frontier Life is a feature-length documentary that explores beyond Tijuana's Sin City heritage, beyond the aura of menace cultivated by the mainstream media, and searches for the heart and identity of a city that is much more than a cantina-strewn throwback to the Old West. This film does not set out to valorize or condemn what it finds. It approaches Tijuana on its own terms, looking at the city not so much in relationship to the U.S., the border, or even other regions in Mexico, but rather from the inside, within its own context.","popularity":0.1121,"poster_path":"/8kQmKIoAswZE1JOXbOg9YLMoPnB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3004,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZU33","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontier Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Amezcua","original_name":"Ramón Amezcua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5687ee9fc3a36860e90236ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Gabriel Beas","original_name":"Pedro Gabriel Beas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5687eeafc3a3686075023022","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raul Cardenas Osuna","original_name":"Raul Cardenas Osuna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5687eec0c3a3684bcc025236","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto A.
