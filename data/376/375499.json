A portrait of Grenada-born Myrtle Wardally (b.1936), a leader of the Cleaners’ Action Group Strike in 1972, it features her discussing the partial success of that campaign and also her childhood in the Caribbean. It’s also an experiment – as probing as it is rapturous – in the politics of film form, and a fascinating deconstruction of the idea of Myrtle as a “symbol of struggle, the nightcleaners, working women, immigrants, mothers, blacks”.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rSxdC1kAVXQH8n9mJR6R4kZvcFr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"36 to 77","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9598722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rSxdC1kAVXQH8n9mJR6R4kZvcFr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
