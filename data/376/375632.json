Her wedding with Robert is actually perfectly organized - the icing on the cake would be the presence of her father, Valentin. For such romantic fits her big sister Bernadette has no understanding. Her producer left early and never looked after his daughters again. Instead, he was thundering through the world as a musician. If it were up to Bernadette, then her father could stay where the pepper grows. As the charming Chaot emerges surprisingly, he brings the wedding and some present quite confused.","popularity":0.256,"poster_path":"/i66gRCUPU8NK0fPUbm9E9SxSfSR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die
