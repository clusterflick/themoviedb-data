And you thought Molly Dodd was a schlemiel. Fred, the most self-obsessed creature since Garfield the Cat, produces, directs, writes, edits and stars in this offbeat, low-budget work. Fred's four children, Fred's tiresome wife Polly, Fred's business partners, psychiatrist, internist, teachers, neighbors, creditors, sommelier and so forth comment on the 42-year-old ne'er-do-well.","popularity":0.329,"poster_path":"/roXftB9C6tPPh3AGgA7Ved4eKRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adirondack Alliance","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Daddy says if people don't come to see this movie, we'll starve.\"","title":"The Beer Drinker's Guide to Fitness and Filmmaking","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sullivan's Pavilion","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1057062,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fred G.
