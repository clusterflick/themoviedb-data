Directed by Adrian Noble, (Amadeus, The King’s Speech, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) Wilde’s superb satire on Victorian manners is one of the funniest plays in the English language.  Two bachelor friends, the adorable dandy Algernon Moncrieff (Philip Cumbus – regular player at Shakespeare’s Globe) and the utterly reliable John Worthing J.P., (Downton Abbey’s Michael Benz) lead double lives to court the attentions of the exquisitely desirable Gwendolyn Fairfax (Emily Barber) and Cecily Cardew (Imogen Doel). The gallants must then grapple with the riotous consequences of their deceptions, and with the formidable Lady Bracknell.","popularity":0.6989,"poster_path":"/eXiMTcBSlQbbcoml2OQ2ALl3kjp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Importance of Being Earnest on Stage","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Suchet","original_name":"David Suchet","popularity":0.8518,"profile_path":"/4X4TT8Uf8mAmRIYgYh4EeR4mWva.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lady Bracknell","credit_id":"56856d8f9251412e5201aaad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Benz","original_name":"Michael Benz","popularity":0.186,"profile_path":"/qb3oEBOpc11maO2CeM7SgbfWQEq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John (Jack) Worthing","credit_id":"56856db89251417e15003ba5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Cumbus","original_name":"Philip Cumbus","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":"/cSPyWF3ReuUPAX9lE0X0TNmWMbZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Algernon Moncrieff","credit_id":"56856dd8925141133401344a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1556259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imogen Doel","original_name":"Imogen Doel","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/rbMvKaZ5Pi8FOqIFFas81oc0M6x.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cecily Cardew","credit_id":"56856df792514131df019582","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Dotrice","original_name":"Michele Dotrice","popularity":0.6969,"profile_path":"/rtBoI6uwH3GCNb7EF3YUHm9HwJ7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Prism","credit_id":"56856e1092514169d0007c84","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1556260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Hooper","original_name":"Brendan Hooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Merriman","credit_id":"56856e2792514169d0007c89","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1556261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Killick","original_name":"David Killick","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lane","credit_id":"56856e3b9251414ecb00d9e3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard O'Callaghan","original_name":"Richard O'Callaghan","popularity":0.2341,"profile_path":"/fDkTty9NSEEh7JPkoTRdTX8IFtx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Reverend Canon Chasuble","credit_id":"56856e5b9251412e5201aac3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1634686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Barber","original_name":"Emily Barber","popularity":0.2547,"profile_path":"/foyYJRBb00SsrEbNRD1JxEZXYGb.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Gwendolen Fairfax","credit_id":"575dc8ed9251414e8f000343","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Noble","original_name":"Adrian Noble","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56856eb092514131df019596","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5280954","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXiMTcBSlQbbcoml2OQ2ALl3kjp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
