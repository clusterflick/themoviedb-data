The video layers haunting imagery and humorous iconoclasm, referencing everything from television episodes of I Love Lucy to Charcot’s 19th Century photos of female hysterics. Delirium contends that female mental illness must be understood within the political/social arena, and that in many instances women’s reactions of violence, anger, and depression are indeed sane reactions to abhorrent situations.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delirium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2089157,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mindy Faber","original_name":"Mindy Faber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce4a169c24fc002a262749","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
