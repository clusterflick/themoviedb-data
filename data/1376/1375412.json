The narrative begins with a timelapse of a spathiphyllum plant, named WILLIAMBABE, purchased on the day of his death, symbolizing the quiet persistence of life and memory. The film transitions into a space shaped by two of Pope.L’s works, Cliff (2012) and Better (2013), evoking a haunting yet reflective atmosphere.  Central to the film is the use of hand-drawn lettering, meticulously created in a darkroom. This process, a ritual of sorts, involves inscribing Pope.L’s words directly onto unexposed film strips, which are then used in the Bolex camera for shooting. This act of embedding his words within the very medium of the film transforms the project into a vessel for his essence. The film invites viewers to reflect on how an artist’s spirit lingers in the spaces and lives they’ve touched, creating a lasting imprint.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WILLIAMBABE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tianjiao Wang","original_name":"Tianjiao Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f713427c5c19f0257d37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Light Matter Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
