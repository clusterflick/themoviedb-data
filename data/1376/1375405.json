Images educate the eye to see the world. The invention of perspective led to the invention of landscape painting and the contemplation of the distant. An animist's vision (which considers that non-human things have a spirit and a social life) operates on different scales. A close-up view reveals relationships between things.  This film questions perception. The optical tracking shot, whose focus varies incessantly, modulates the viewer's gaze. The eye's path is deregulated, and the transition from macro to micro breaks the illusionist view and eliminates all perspective. No special effects are applied to the image : the plastic approach stems from the alteration of the video playback codec. The deteriorated video file fails - just like the deregulated eye - to render an illusionistic view. The explosion of color and the organic movements of pixels reveal a new possibility of looking.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/hHogmgKX9iTBXaxn6ZsDSlyxeYB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infravision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Guibert","original_name":"Joris Guibert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f5675be9e8759da6959d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHogmgKX9iTBXaxn6ZsDSlyxeYB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Light Matter","release_date":"2024-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
