Taking as a motto a fiction about a couple who finds an idea of home in their car trips, the video explores a place of duration within the non-representable space beyond the resolution of a happy ending (a convention that marks the end of the dramatic interest of a story). Through repetition and loop, it plays with the archetype of the tunnel (space of passage and transformation), remaining in an intermediate state, between escapism and ecstasy, light and darkness, speed and continuity. Unforeseen elements such as reflections and optical effects, radio sounds and interferences, laughter and breathing, become symbols of being on a journey, where directions are influenced by improvisation and attention is tuned, permeable to the elastic time of a shared experience.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/313auZI7k4NMwy8g38Ht7uckItB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Ending","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Madaleno","original_name":"Tiago Madaleno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717fc82a4ac8a432c5bb8f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Patrão","original_name":"Joana Patrão","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717fc99c7802cc5035988e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/313auZI7k4NMwy8g38Ht7uckItB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Light Matter Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
