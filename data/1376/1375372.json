Sara was reminded of many similar situations in her life where she faced rejection and was not allowed to do certain things, so we decided to summarize some examples and combine documentary and animation to represent what so many BIPOC people experience (BIPOC = Black People, Indigenous People, and People of Color).  Finding your place in life is a challenge in itself. However, being rejected based on external traits is devastating. By transforming these very traits into superpowers, you can reclaim your life and self-worth, stand up for yourself, and become part of a society.","popularity":0.1843,"poster_path":"/nH7gh0aqwTb0QF7aqpgk0PIBCTN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in Helsinki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1200347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Fazilat","original_name":"Sara Fazilat","popularity":0.1634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717e33039a2066f22f9b721","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426576,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Antonia Lange","original_name":"Antonia Lange","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717e34c867234c2e316f636","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426576,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Antonia Lange","original_name":"Antonia Lange","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717e3fe94065a7fa4b9791c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4832948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lorenz Fischer","original_name":"Lorenz Fischer","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/l2tkWloz4xY08AajLeeOTNjHa10.jpg","credit_id":"6717e42739a2066f22f9b7e4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263035,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Henderson","original_name":"Guy Henderson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717e43b39a2066f22f9b7ee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nH7gh0aqwTb0QF7aqpgk0PIBCTN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
