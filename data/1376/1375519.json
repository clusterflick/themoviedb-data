The film, Kora, provides a similar journey - an exodus of the senses and the mind. A hypnotic, non-narrative film, in the vein of such classics as Koyaanisqatsi or Baraka, Kora combines images from Chinese and Tibetan culture, along with other sights and landscapes from those environs, with electronic music. The focus of the feature is not on easily-identifiable landmarks, for such would reduce it to a travelogue. Rather, the film focuses on the people and culture itself as a means of piquing curiosity within the viewer and leaving him/her with a general sense of awe after the film closes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
