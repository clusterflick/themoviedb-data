On the ocean voyage, Richard meets Betty Winthrop, the ward of the wealthy Van Allen family. Introducing himself he mistakenly gives her the card of John Smithers, a conman who cheated him at cards in London. He follows Betty to the Van Allen estate, where he hears her declare that she would rather marry an American criminal than a weakling English aristocrat. Determined to win her over, he pretends to be Smithers, but things don't turn out exactly the way he planned.","popularity":0.1682,"poster_path":"/yUvSqCOmzMNGqY6HfcORyfQV0Qu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World
