Strangers to me, but maybe not to each other. Found in a Berlin flea market in the 1990's, these slides originated in the DDR (East Germany):an embossed DDR decorates the top of many of the vivid plastic slide frames.  The slides' photographic images were made of ephemeral materials. As objects, they have a certain graphic power, especially when illuminated on a light table.  Scattered among the boxed-up slides were also a few educational slides highlighting working sites. Additionally, there seem to be a few commercially produced images of soldiers, the border---these were in cardboard slide frames and may have been produced by West German companies.  Time and place are suggested---sometime before 1989, when the wall came down. Working with the slides, I came to feel that I knew some of the people. Many emerged across multiple slides. But I can only know their traces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5XlzM8zKzdAL8QNd5NOEUSn0qLy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slideshow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janie Geiser","original_name":"Janie Geiser","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/1rgqjWeJNfuOqCTWax9hg2VMQXD.jpg","credit_id":"6717ff1c5be9e8759da696ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5XlzM8zKzdAL8QNd5NOEUSn0qLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Light Matter Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
