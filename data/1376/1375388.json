For over 100 years, people have come to this place in the hope of being cured. So do Nina and Henri, both in mid-life, burnt out, and from different backgrounds. Their paths cross between the dining room and therapy, at a time when they are struggling to find their inner peace. Then the place is snowed in and everything becomes slow and quiet. The ghosts and stories from the long corridors become their companions. While the two read each other the riot act and try to forget their loneliness, a historian digs through the house archives for documents from the early days of the sanatorium. She researches the sanatorium as a focal point of the modern history of exhaustion and traces a narrative from neurasthenia to the inner restlessness of the present for her dissertation. The house becomes a setting for an archaeology of exhaustion.","popularity":0.1045,"poster_path":"/4zdsuHO6YaXxfqIFeMOVKCbD3j6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101509,"logo_path":"/al4qRaI9Vet4CXbeqI0DE0KnIdl.png","name":"CORSO Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Formen moderner Erschöpfung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2843170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Unterweger","original_name":"Birgit Unterweger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nina Dahlhoff","credit_id":"6717eb26867234c2e316f899","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Stachowiak","original_name":"Rafael Stachowiak","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/ib6ui3FIKUngxTrK6UbFJNNNzDz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Henri Kahn","credit_id":"6717eb4de03a43c369ac7741","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf List","original_name":"Wolf List","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Robert Wilms","credit_id":"6717f211d8c88a6557e19d0c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5025320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Bernhardt","original_name":"Sarah Bernhardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Historikerin","credit_id":"671e2b08769107d77b480f36","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Sitnik","original_name":"Marcel Sitnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Knabensopran","credit_id":"67295f4c433c82ea267e5061","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sascha Hilpert","original_name":"Sascha Hilpert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717eafd94065a7fa4b97a41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sascha Hilpert","original_name":"Sascha Hilpert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f25594065a7fa4b97c4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326853,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Rosefeldt","original_name":"Martin Rosefeldt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f263bd1980963cc08de2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uHeUr0WnoZc28sRNjPpyLsqA0ag.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1801,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/4zdsuHO6YaXxfqIFeMOVKCbD3j6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1286}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
