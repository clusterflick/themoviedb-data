And if itâ€™s not a question of if, but when?  Braided Sand engages the geologic materiality of imaging and communication technologies. There is no lens without sand, which itself is the result of millions of years of geologic activity. Filmed at a sand mine, a glass factory, and a nanotech laboratory, the film moves between observation and abstraction, juxtaposing human and geologic timescales, plunging the viewer into churning industrial environments to lay bare the weighty earthly bases of seemingly invisible and immaterial infrastructures.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Braided Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracy Szatan","original_name":"Tracy Szatan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f765c7802cc5035987fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Light Matter Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
