ABC's 9-1-1 is a magical combination of Ryan Murphy camp, broadcast TV-budget visual effects, and (possibly) unintentional homoeroticism the likes of which audiences haven't seen since... Supernatural? Maybe? Today I'll take you on an aggressively long-winded tour of all the show has to offer. The best and worst characters and storylines, the copaganda, the gay shipping, that Bobby Brown dance sequence from Step Up: All In, and so much more. This is a deep dive of Homeric proportions.
