A giant wild fig tree stands at the centre of a remote flood plain in northwestern Zambia. Without warning or explanation, the pride male has vanished, leaving five females and their cubs to cope alone. Sooner or later, other lions will challenge them for this prime territory with its abundant food and water. Tragedy and drama envelop the lives of the fig tree pride as they fight for survival. Against a backdrop of spectacular African scenery, the alpha female must guide her sisters and the cubs through treacherous times as two very different competing males attempt to take over the pride","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":"/66DMz0vuJGkyCuhIIduLpS43laF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camera Africa Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZW","name":"Zimbabwe"}],"release_date":"2010-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lion Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Stutchbury","original_name":"Ralph Stutchbury","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f307bd1980963cc08e47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Stutchbury","original_name":"Ralph Stutchbury","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f3143d3df80f09cb4bba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6399468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":1445,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42lN3E9LTOAnNh8UK70XIo8fhFd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2565}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/66DMz0vuJGkyCuhIIduLpS43laF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":251493,"name":"big cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Off the Fence BV","release_date":"2010-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
