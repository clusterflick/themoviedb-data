During his rotations and vacations, Oleksandr played in the theater, gave concerts, studied to become a military psychologist, and tried to communicate with his young son as often as possible. Over time, he began to feel a certain duality in his life: the world of war and the world of art, to which he equally belonged, could not coexist in one person; an empty house and short moments with his son only reminded him of the happy times when his family was close; uncertainty about the future of his career, family, country and the inability to influence anything made Oleksandr think about the question “what is the purpose of life for me now?”","popularity":0.1342,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91783,"logo_path":"/iVG8XTM5XVmsXJHxdt0CyucWuVH.png","name":"Sota Cinema Group","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":242558,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Arte Cinema Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Sign «Artist»","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1689032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleksandr Pecherytsia","original_name":"Олександр Печериця","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/8Ja4s3KPVsW0TilKbaCDNlGqpkg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6717f820e833d92ef05f9971","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maksym Tuzov","original_name":"Maksym Tuzov","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f78fe833d92ef05f9949","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maksym Tuzov","original_name":"Maksym Tuzov","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f79d4542e371fe0a0781","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maksym Tuzov","original_name":"Maksym Tuzov","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f7a76e4210780f7874c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741289,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lev Kostenko","original_name":"Lev Kostenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f7b64542e371fe0a0792","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oleh Kokhan","original_name":"Oleh Kokhan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f7e96e4210780f7874c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015945,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oleksandr Kokhanovskyi","original_name":"Oleksandr Kokhanovskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717f802c7802cc50359884e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
