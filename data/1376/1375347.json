This film is an epic journey for real people facing serious danger – if they don’t lose weight they will die. It’s not fun, it’s dangerous.  Diets fail, sometimes surgery isn’t possible, so what happens to these people? This is the real story of five people who wanted to lose 100 to 200 lbs in a year. They were teamed with professionals willing to help them for free. There was a doctor, fitness coaches, therapist, life coach and nutritionist all there to assist.  We hope this film will help start a global movement towards a healthy life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/criqswf75QXASeIVgBmbfibV8Ph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"DONUT GET CAUGHT UP IN ANOTHER FAILED DIET","title":"It's Huge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5809696","wikidata_id":"Q27042503","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":2234,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/criqswf75QXASeIVgBmbfibV8Ph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
