Politically, because the film is about the liberation war. Socio-psychologically, because the war divided the families: close relatives live on different sides of the border and know nothing about each other. We interviewed those who lead the Resistance, ordinary partisans, and volunteers. The interviews are rarely shown on screen, but we hear them: these conversations comment on what viewers see in the frame. Together with the cameraman, I spent a long time in the liberated areas, we brought a lot of film, and the film, in essence, was born at the editing table. The world did not know about the heroic struggle of the people of Angola, full of hardships. That is why we made this film, so that the world would know the truth about Angola.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberdade e Terra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZR","title":"Freedom and Land","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5016722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matondo Kamanka","original_name":"Matondo Kamanka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67187e804542e371fe0a1471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
