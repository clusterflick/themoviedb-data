The film delves into the concept of a \"blank slate\" (the meaning of tabula rasa) and explores how individuals are shaped by their experiences, choices, and memories.  A poignant exploration of a family grappling with financial instability, '\"Tabula Rasa' is a social commentary on how dreams could be sold in the age of the internet, in the film's case a television set. The artificial illusions thereby created have real-life repercussions without a reset button.  Ishan Pehal's direction brings a layered, introspective depth to the film, with an emphasis on atmosphere, emotion, and subtle character development. The film's meditative pace and abstract narrative invite audiences to reflect on the nature of self-discovery, the fluidity of identity, and the influence of external forces on our sense of self.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/AhgK057qBL6mDSVGhd9xbI1wlsJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Blank Slate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"A Blank Slate","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pawan Sharma","original_name":"Pawan Sharma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6717916b2b9f34249aea08e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akanksha Shandil","original_name":"Akanksha Shandil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6717918155ecf7a940f79bbd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ajay Thakur","original_name":"Ajay Thakur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6717918d55ecf7a940f79bc8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devasya Sharma","original_name":"Devasya Sharma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6717919d9f61ec6bcf1513f6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajesh Kumar","original_name":"Rajesh Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671791d365418f2b86bec7ea","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015274,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pranav Pathania","original_name":"Pranav Pathania","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671791fa9f61ec6bcf151424","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015275,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Deekshant Pandey","original_name":"Deekshant Pandey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671792212b9f34249aea090e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015281,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anukash Pandey","original_name":"Anukash Pandey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717925e55ecf7a940f79bfc","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dhruv Bakshi","original_name":"Dhruv Bakshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717927a55ecf7a940f79c12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anmol Sidhu","original_name":"Anmol Sidhu","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6717929145cd676223589929","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ishan Pehal","original_name":"Ishan Pehal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718d3879ff681d9e0a392f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1636,"iso_639_1":"hi","file_path":"/AhgK057qBL6mDSVGhd9xbI1wlsJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
