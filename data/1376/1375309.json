Soon, he becomes addicted to drugs, neglects his wife and child, and his business is on the verge of ruin. By chance he meets his double, western mining engineer Martin Stanley. Demarest, half mad due to his drug addiction, conceives the fantastic idea of having Stanley take his place in the world enabling him to indulge in his degraded desires. Stanely, penniless and alone in the world accepts the proposition despite his reservations. Demarest drops into oblivion and Stanley picks up the scattered threads of his life, both in business and at home. The \"at home\" part is what causes complications.","popularity":0.1113,"poster_path":"/llo5El9fzguFhD4qyC1VP0v7dzO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wonderful Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Farnum","original_name":"William Farnum","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/a2N7jJoXYLHaUFBDMGMuIgqja60.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Martin Stanley","credit_id":"6717c1022b9f34249aea10c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1568218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Green","original_name":"Dorothy Green","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/mlZBD1JTlVQxiwxt302pvJVe5Sa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mazora","credit_id":"6717c10c9f61ec6bcf15175b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1488486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Martin","original_name":"Mary Martin","popularity":0.0567,"profile_path":"/7ageYIPVqSOkGcES3xyYgCg4oKx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eleanor Demarest","credit_id":"6717c11f10190d24af9afbad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Davidson","original_name":"John Davidson","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/bfM1Hzm6nPoTY8cm4mafA8ycpkf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"M.
