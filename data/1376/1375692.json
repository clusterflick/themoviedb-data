The work applies the poetic and conceptual strategies of the crease and the fold to move through the fugitive geography of a sleep cycle.  Walking through stages one to four of sleep, the film is inhabited by (and inhabits) an ​‘impossible protagonist’. Amidst the land-mind-body disintegration of the dream as a site and realm of exile, this impossible protagonist forms a vehicle and question in the work, escaping language to think out of time with the image.’","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"in the house of names","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4782118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sulaïman Majali","original_name":"Sulaïman Majali","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718b4ab5d0de89042d8a802","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":340486,"name":"margaret tait"},{"id":340487,"name":"lux"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
