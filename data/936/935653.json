Around 800 B.C.E., King Xuan of the Zhou dynasty engaged in battle with Ma Lan, leader of Wen, and invaded the smaller state. Yali came under Zhou rule, but in the Valley of Xuanyao, a sacred place associated with the Wen's deity, Liu Liliu, a few resistance fighters covertly continued the struggle against their would-be conquerors. It is now spring. A young man who has been dispatched from Haojing, the Zhou capital, steps foot into Yali. His mission is to find the Valley of Xuanyao, where forces hostile still against King Xuan remain in hiding, and to bring them under the yoke of Zhou.","popularity":0.2117,"poster_path":"/3bu7ciXILKiZiK8q5rAiHS6OXTY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valley of Xuanyao","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3387879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makoto Rei","original_name":"礼真琴","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/kOmmFgO3vhL5idan2XBvWT7XdbX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dan Lizhen (Tan Reishin)","credit_id":"61fffeb3e27260006b7d81fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3415468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maisora Hitomi","original_name":"舞空瞳","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/vxGgDQy0cYbzXh72j5s4vJorNv1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tong Hua (Touka)","credit_id":"61fffecc00508a001b866009","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xeDfl2jmptZNltSMIVb4vm4Plue.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3bu7ciXILKiZiK8q5rAiHS6OXTY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":291486,"name":"star troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"【公式】＜サンプルムービー＞眩耀の谷～舞い降りた新星～（'20年星組・東京・千秋楽）","key":"oOVQx__RBhY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-02T10:00:32.000Z","id":"61ffff9247c9fb0043f04c7b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"星組公演『眩耀（げんよう）の谷　～舞い降りた新星～』『Ｒａｙ　-星の光線-』初日舞台映像（ロング）","key":"9_Thuhfz0WE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-14T05:03:23.000Z","id":"61ffff9ae9da6900e290e2f6"}]}}}
