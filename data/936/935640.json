In duality we see one as the opposite of the other. Yet darkness is the absence of light. And an absence is not a measurable thing. It simply does not exist.  Light protects us from our fundamental fear of the dark. But where there is light, there must be shadow. We live in a technological era where our dependence on energy is greater than ever before. It became an irreplaceable commodity.  The film takes us on a journey of how fragile our modern reality is.","popularity":0.0632,"poster_path":"/jxqT3ouNinDwrUkmowrvURNhxYU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93139,"logo_path":"/jnKNXs1t9svg8VhAar2f8hadXWX.png","name":"Fachhochschule Dortmund","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do you do, if the sun pulls the plug on you?","title":"Absence of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415475,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bal-Aton Bori","original_name":"Bal-Aton Bori","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200005be54d5d006bbf5570","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3415473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Aliné","original_name":"Beatrice Aliné","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200001d47c9fb008eb44e59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Woo","original_name":"Johann Woo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62000040109230004342a3a4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3415473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Aliné","original_name":"Beatrice Aliné","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200002b8f26bc0043d6f4ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958311,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joris Bölt","original_name":"Joris Bölt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200007d47c9fb0043f04dd5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415475,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bal-Aton Bori","original_name":"Bal-Aton Bori","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620000b35a5ed000d168a223","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415476,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Pauli","original_name":"Tim Pauli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6200006ba24232001b0149ae","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Woo","original_name":"Johann Woo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620000915a5ed000992e389f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxqT3ouNinDwrUkmowrvURNhxYU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nXIw8pkbHPIr4bs8R0IQoMcGAD2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
