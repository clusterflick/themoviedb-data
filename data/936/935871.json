When Jules left from his home near Port Arthur (Thunder Bay), Ontario, his father, a famous Finnish poet, wrote a lasting lament: “To My Son In Spain”.  In 1936-37, 1700 Canadians volunteered to fight with the Spanish people against a fascist coup d’etat led by elements of the Spanish Army. Backed by Musselini and Hitler, the fascists were bent on overthrowing Spain’s democratically elected socialist government and replacing it with military and church rule. It could be argued this conflict marked the true beginning of what would become World War II.","popularity":0.2503,"poster_path":"/nTJtdwZr9f8T4bZYh3a12Upm3mh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24725,"logo_path":"/1HhNIJjQO2enpg76YNryXBWribp.png","name":"Ontario Arts
