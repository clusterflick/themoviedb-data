Marina Chapman does not know her real name or her biological family. She claims that when she was a child in Colombia she was kidnapped and abandoned in the jungle and that she survived with monkeys for five years. Now, fifty years later, Marina returns to Colombia with her daughter to try to discover the truth. Scientists will analyze her bones, test her subconscious responses, examine the inner workings of her mind, and a primatologist will try to find flaws in his knowledge of monkeys and her behavior. Who was her real family? Why was she kidnapped? Could a five-year-old girl really survive in the jungle in the company of monkeys? is it all a fantasy story?
