Over 70 tempera paintings are beautifully brought to life and put together by FUKADA Koji for this Ga-nime that tells us the story of a mother and child in the 19th century, coated in a music that punctuates the whole experience. FUKAZAWA and FUKADA thus succeed in reproducing the ambiance of this mansion so dear to BALZAC, as the artistic pictures call to the imagination and the emotions of the viewer that only be so aroused by a Ga-nime.","popularity":0.1895,"poster_path":"/t4uAJCFCARPOCl3jIxWXjVCDi53.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Grenadière","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ざくろ屋敷　バルザック「人間喜劇」より","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Grenadière","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"La Grenadière","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Zakuro Yashiki","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koji Fukada","original_name":"深田晃司","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/mOcKGo3JUsUF7AXpj5D2LJxkVDG.jpg","credit_id":"61ffffa4109230008bf22d8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415486,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nooki Ueo","original_name":"Nooki Ueo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62000415e54d5d00d296ee85","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koji Fukada","original_name":"深田晃司","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/mOcKGo3JUsUF7AXpj5D2LJxkVDG.jpg","credit_id":"6200034f5a5ed00042e73f17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3415487,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ken Fukazawa","original_name":"Ken Fukazawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62000442a402c10067414b89","department":"Art","job":"Painter"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Honoré de Balzac","original_name":"Honoré de Balzac","popularity":0.267,"profile_path":"/40WbN9E3AnfBSjiN8Ip85eb6L0I.jpg","credit_id":"6200035f1e9225631544477e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22095020","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t4uAJCFCARPOCl3jIxWXjVCDi53.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
