Bobby is a cute little youngster of six, and Sam is of age and spends his father's money with recklessness. Richard Freely, an arch-enemy of Harms', is continually trying to dissolve the corporation, and not until Newton, a half-brother to Freely, has forged some checks on a good friend of Harms', does the financier secure a wedge with which to ruin Freely. Harms threatens to expose his enemy for defending Newton, and Freely is saved from bodily injury by Bobby, who has come to ask his father for candy. Meantime Sam has forged his father's name to a check and handed it to Newton in payment of gambling debts. Harms is about to sacrifice his son to down Freely, when the little \"Buffer' again bursts in and drags Sam away to play horse.","popularity":0.1761,"poster_path":"/r9fgZ41zBfNXebhQFJARMN6OlaU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Buffer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Travers","original_name":"Richard Travers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ibXu8PEoEZXQEAt6NjRbMYH1V6m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Richard Freely - District Attorney","credit_id":"61fda504180dea00691761b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rapley Holmes","original_name":"Rapley Holmes","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John Harms","credit_id":"61fda52b51c01f00419f688b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cossar","original_name":"John Cossar","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/eSNYJl4CY2nJkRO3VXY5V5hlQ3e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Newton - the Forger","credit_id":"61fda53a91b53000b6e5a553","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3413093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Leonard","original_name":"Cyril Leonard","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sam Harms","credit_id":"61fda54a21621b00946255fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3413094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Master Rockwell","original_name":"Master Rockwell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bobbie Harms","credit_id":"61fda559f03174006794ec3e","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1269531","wikidata_id":"Q15043936","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r9fgZ41zBfNXebhQFJARMN6OlaU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
