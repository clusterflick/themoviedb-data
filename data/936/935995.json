The convict saves the warden's little daughter from drowning and is pardoned for his brave deed. Meanwhile his released cellmate forces the convict's wife again and again to give him money, and calling at her home one night, attempts to kiss her, but she repels him with a revolver. The pardoned convict arrives just in time to hear what passes and almost chokes his former cellmate to death.","popularity":0.1307,"poster_path":"/7Jz1TVeObp5xDU7gvp8NjTuDsnY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Convict's Threat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
