His daughter goes to the agent's office to ask for more time and the agent, smitten with her beauty, forces his attentions on her. She rejects him and he threatens to evict father and daughter. The owner advises the agent to foreclose if the settler refuses to pay, but to give him plenty of time if he is unable to. The agent, however, wires that the settler refuses to pay and proceeds to evict the pair. Meanwhile, the owner is advised by his physician to go to the country for his health.","popularity":0.212,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Unexpected Romance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
