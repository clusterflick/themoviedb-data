Three Hong Kong media outlets popular with the opposition have folded in just six months, following the introduction of a controversial national security law in Hong Kong on June 30, 2020, raising fears about the future of press freedom in the city. The 29-year-old is starting a new life in Britain’s northern city of Manchester and plans to eventually resume his journalism career in Europe.","popularity":0.5779,"poster_path":"/emvgJ9BOBuufkZP4CK3Rh6iPhq1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169369,"logo_path":null,"name":"SCMP Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Hong Kong journalist’s difficult decision to leave the city","title":"Because I Choose Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3414614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Leung Ming-hong","original_name":"Matthew Leung Ming-hong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61feebf93acd200042010387","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3414617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Li","original_name":"Lea Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61feec3c0ce1bc00e537c025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fRmMbqfn38mHMQIobg969WteuYo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1581}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/emvgJ9BOBuufkZP4CK3Rh6iPhq1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":917,"name":"journalism"},{"id":7272,"name":"press freedom"},{"id":270719,"name":"hong kong protests"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Hong Kong journalist’s difficult decision to leave the city","key":"wGMF0UnYOVg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-05T00:00:24.000Z","id":"61feeb828a84d200ba0595a1"}]}}}
