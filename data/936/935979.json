He is met at the door by a pretty girl, and it is a case of love at first sight. The girl's father, leader of the lumber thieves, returns to find her before a small mirror arranging her hair, and upbraids her for her vanity. The ranger hears and, as the father is about to strike the girl, rushes out and hurls the man from her. When the ranger departs, the leader of the thieves follows with a rifle, and catching the ranger unawares, forces him to go to the thieves' rendezvous. The girl, who has seen, rushes to call the sheriff. Meanwhile the thieves draw lots to see who shall kill the ranger. It falls to the chief, who is about to shoot the ranger when the sheriff and his aides rush up and arrest the thieves.","popularity":0.2818,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broncho Billy and the Lumber King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
