And the proud Maasai warriors have hunted them ruthlessly in return so that now only about 2,000 remain in the country. If their numbers drop any lower, their populations will not be sustainable. Now the Maasai elders and chiefs are recognizing that the threat to their lions is also a threat to their way of life, and have forbidden the warriors from hunting them. Wildlife filmmaker Kire Godal, with the support of executive producers Dereck and Beverly Joubert, captures firsthand the struggle of these modern-day warriors who are reinventing their traditions to help save the lions they once prided themselves on killing.","popularity":0.3019,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":147121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Godal Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":123388,"logo_path":"/fAtGS8zDA5g2Qovf7uwPgiD2zID.png","name":"National Geographic Channels International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic: Lion Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Stanners","original_name":"Richard Stanners","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ffa8c6ede11e5003deebb23","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dereck Joubert","original_name":"Dereck Joubert","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/slM6ykUAMLZknVxSY2pZjM2l3PL.jpg","credit_id":"5ffa8d20a0be2800408edb19","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beverly Joubert","original_name":"Beverly Joubert","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/k4H4MicpxWV23tGSmiofTNMtcLO.jpg","credit_id":"5ffa8d35b5400200410ebfc2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kire Godal","original_name":"Kire Godal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8c8666ae4d003f0f7d2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kire Godal","original_name":"Kire Godal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8cffa3b5e6004135d813","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kire Godal","original_name":"Kire Godal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8c930fb17f003d3dba15","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kire Godal","original_name":"Kire Godal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8ca0efea7a003f70a65a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Godal","original_name":"Erik Godal","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8cabafa1b00040c10253","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kire Godal","original_name":"Kire Godal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8cb9fcec2e0041164aae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Godal","original_name":"Erik Godal","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa8d0ca3b5e6004135d847","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2930075,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600f737b9a6435004092e690","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1722628","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aJCec8L25hswM27n7FswK78N2gy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":249068,"name":"maasai"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
