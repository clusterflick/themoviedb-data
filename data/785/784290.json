They survived.  In 1954, a riot broke out in Jezkazan, Kazakhstan.  The men’s camp and women’s camp joined together and held on for 40 days.  Then came the tanks that killed more than 1,000 of them.  Austra Vērpe met her future husband there.  They were lucky to stay alive.  The dream of the musician Zigfrīds Muktupāvels was to find the grave of his paternal uncle in far-off Kazakhstan.  He was named after his uncle, who never came home.  Zigfrīds and a cousin headed off into the steppes to look for a monument reading “Zigfrīds Muktupāvels.”  The next round of deportations occurred in 1949, and whole families were sent to Siberia.  Fathers were tried in court, a great many ended up in punitive camps in Vorkuta and Inta.  Skaidrīte Jostmane and Māris Landers travelled to Vorkuta to find their father’s gravesite.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/pSvW4hLUUlMfcN0rgDfGYjLdE2U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibīrijas bērni","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fathers Over There","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ēriks Lanss","original_name":"Ēriks Lanss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff91dacefea7a00406e9af2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff91e1191f0ea003e94bc50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"5ff91d8d61bac4003fa9f464","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Viktors Grībermans","original_name":"Viktors Grībermans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff91de361bac4003fa9f50a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Lubānietis","original_name":"Aivars Lubānietis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff91dc77f1d830041f37c84","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armands Zvirbulis","original_name":"Armands Zvirbulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff91e02bdd5680041297d74","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Vasks","original_name":"Pēteris Vasks","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/sydsEChqbQifMFNRgDai2U58a3R.jpg","credit_id":"5ff91e2bed28b9003f73e8ec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"5ff91d7a20af77003d17b457","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pSvW4hLUUlMfcN0rgDfGYjLdE2U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dokumentāla filma \"Tēvi Tur\"","key":"P0YY8l21o-g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-28T10:40:05.000Z","id":"601073e3cb8028004003c361"}]}}}
