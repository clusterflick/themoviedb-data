In The Path to Baltic Freedom the authors focus on lesser known pages of history – the influence of perestroika on the early national movements of the 1980s, the role and participation of the Secret Service and the Communist Party in the newly-forming mass movements and their wish to guide or at least control them. The history of the Popular Front is shown not only until their victory in the first free elections in the history of the USSR that resulted in the restoration of independence for the Baltic states; the film also includes the decline of the organization after it had reached the most crucial of its goals.","popularity":0.1427,"poster_path":"/fC92BvRx5hROwmTfyM52p4pSg1t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Subjektiv Filma","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":147040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clio Works","origin_country":""},{"id":147041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra Europa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Path to Baltic Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Keišs","original_name":"Andris Keišs","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/7ycuAovV8wFC6oiAMsAIF5GL6ou.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5ff8a0d7336e0100407cf07c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgars Engīzers","original_name":"Edgars Engīzers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8a004fcec2e004013d701","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2910394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Armands Treilihs","original_name":"Armands Treilihs","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8a0befcec2e00411367a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928330,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ilze Jaunberga","original_name":"Ilze Jaunberga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8a09e91f0ea0040939cf7","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dainis Īvāns","original_name":"Dainis Īvāns","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/aKBNGjaP5mrW72CWnMkV0vtB1cr.jpg","credit_id":"5ff8a020336e01003e7c2bfe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5ff89f2c61bac4003ca8c1e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5ff89f3761bac4003ca8c20a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5ff89f21ed28b9003f73023d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2856994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Askolds Saulītis","original_name":"Askolds Saulītis","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/uwlwSd4IjKbDe8SwzUkDhlJnU9L.jpg","credit_id":"5ff89f49dd83fa003d6cb9aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"5ff8a087383df2003e322d4b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fC92BvRx5hROwmTfyM52p4pSg1t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ATMODAS ANTOLOĢIJA tīzeris","key":"kczIIQNvxow","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2018-01-09T17:37:15.000Z","id":"5ff8fb3fed28b9004073b6bf"}]}}}
