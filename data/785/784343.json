The documentary (from which NZ On Screen has three excerpts)  explores what happened and why, with accounts by family members, survivors, and DoC staff. Made three years after the tragedy, the programme looked at its lasting impact on those left behind. It won Best Documentary at the 1998 NZ Television Awards.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":103181,"logo_path":"/aqicjb5pM859n0CLwrLoGnjyecb.png","name":"Greenstone TV","origin_country":"NZ"},{"id":295,"logo_path":"/24lAsHZaGi4GzNrWzlkK60HLMBx.png","name":"NZ on Air","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cave Creek: The Full Story of a National Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929011,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Harris","original_name":"John Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff9740bfcec2e003e141ed2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2929007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliet Monaghan","original_name":"Juliet Monaghan","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff973220c1255003ef0f64a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929009,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Pattinson","original_name":"Tim Pattinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff9736b20af77003e16ea8f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929010,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bridgid Davis","original_name":"Bridgid Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff9737f7f1d83003ef4a698","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tony Manson","original_name":"Tony Manson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff97342fcec2e004114a79c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colin McRae","original_name":"Colin McRae","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff97358a0be2800418dc707","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cave Creek: The Full Story of a National Tragedy","key":"5SVwv5Uhnkw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2016-12-05T00:48:56.000Z","id":"5ff97450fcec2e004114a821"}]}}}
