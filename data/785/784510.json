A DIE HARD Musical Parody","overview":"Yippee Ki-Yay Merry Christmas: A Die Hard Musical Parody debuted November 29, 2014 at MCL Chicago, a storefront theatre founded in July of the same year by Stephanie McCullough, Michael Shepherd Jordan, and Alex Garday to celebrate the art of music comedy, blending their shared experiences in improv, musical improv, and musical theater. In late September, only having been open three months, the founders realized they needed a show for the Fall/Winter season. Acting volunteer secretary at the time, Alex Richmond, mentioned that her family watched Die Hard every holiday season and the C4 was set, so to speak. The founders quickly went to work parodying the beloved 80s action movie turning it into the hilarious musical audiences know and love today.","popularity":0.1068,"poster_path":"/4O1t45xRAjJxHUxaTTJRowuXcRx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yippee Ki-Yay Merry Christmas!
