She moves onwards to explore new/old territories, revealing something of her past in Indonesia and China via Singapore as the episode progresses. During her journey she meets the resourceful Senait, an Eritrean refugee who subsists by evaporating water from the Dead Sea to make it potable. In her ongoing effort to compile an archive of those who remain, Ding Ling records an interview with Senait, where Senait recounts her own peripatetic past and perilous journey through Sudan.","popularity":0.2606,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leviathan Cycle, Episode 6: Ding Ling & Senait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3208465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Lim","original_name":"Jennifer Lim","popularity":0.2261,"profile_path":"/1HvKFKgzGTTZMuAceu4gMpt2C1u.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ding Ling","credit_id":"6122b4be66ae4d005b5630cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senait Zebrabrucbc","original_name":"Senait Zebrabrucbc","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Senait","credit_id":"5ffbec8991f0ea003f9a3b65","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bhasker Patel","original_name":"Bhasker Patel","popularity":0.2762,"profile_path":"/1OyDAhaJ5cmwRy5igRdeRtH3OUY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nemo","credit_id":"5ffbec9447c9fb003f77d169","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Benjamin","original_name":"Elizabeth Benjamin","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffbeca4fcec2e003f1a751a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Miroshnik","original_name":"Michael Miroshnik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffbecc520af77003f1c4192","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shezad Dawood","original_name":"Shezad Dawood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffbec5b20af77003d1cdb03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shezad Dawood","original_name":"Shezad Dawood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffbec52fcec2e003f1a7496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931621,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bart Sinkiewicz","original_name":"Bart Sinkiewicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffbecb0957e6d003f14ce2a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
