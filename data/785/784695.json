In successive kings, Shakespeare sketches an image of political leaders, face to face with the ultimate responsibility for life and death in times of war. Shakespeare’s kings are political leaders who come face to face with the ultimate responsibility: they must make the life-or-death decision of whether to go to war. Shakespeare draws us into the psychology of the rulers, while also revealing the machinations of their courtiers and advisors. Kings of War lays bare the mechanisms of decision-making in times of political crisis, exposing the dichotomy between national interests and self-importance.","popularity":0.384,"poster_path":"/8FMbLxJ6DhJspUSSuuurED06DHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147166,"logo_path":null,"name":"ITA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":270,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kings of War combines Henry V, Henry VI and Richard III into a single, explosive play about leadership.","title":"Kings of War","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":282916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramsey Nasr","original_name":"Ramsey Nasr","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/zyH1qcMwAolLKSpacDdLn6yJKUo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Henry V / Richmond","credit_id":"5ffba58d957e6d003f143622","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eelco Smits","original_name":"Eelco Smits","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/iMqEraLGwSnL09JoLOTNizonCVq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Henry VI / Grey","credit_id":"5ffba6ae1bf876003f2e790c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Kesting","original_name":"Hans Kesting","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/u9EB0MIx1FLIbePNWYvWzpt0HMt.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Richard III","credit_id":"6028a0f7097c490040a06be6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivo van Hove","original_name":"Ivo van Hove","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61558c6a4d6791002cde86e1","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"64c38bf8af6e9400ae3c8c64","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2880302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bart Van Den Eynde","original_name":"Bart Van Den Eynde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffba51c91f0ea0041973d21","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter van Kraaij","original_name":"Peter van Kraaij","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffba530a3b5e6003e3798b6","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":"internationaaltheateramsterdam","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nJoE50qAzNqEvbkgI4yHrLPaVWN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6rLRXLvmplZOGXUlbVqaqRLs2P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8FMbLxJ6DhJspUSSuuurED06DHg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159862,"name":"british history"},{"id":165214,"name":"shakespeare in modern dress"},{"id":230318,"name":"live theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kings of war - Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (subtitled)","key":"VUdpYmBALG8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-21T19:22:18.000Z","id":"6182bacaa097dc002ab7b20d"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer Kings of war 15|16 - Toneelgroep Amsterdam","key":"xi9vEYbSaMo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-26T10:45:12.000Z","id":"5ffba4e4fab3fa003d4dc46e"}]}}}
