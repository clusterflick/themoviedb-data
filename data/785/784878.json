Black and white, alcoholics, blind people, wheelchairs...the down and out in Sydney. I was greatly influenced by documentary films I saw at the Workers’ Education Association Film Group. Real images were cut together with footage I’d shot in Waverley Cemetery—a cemetery here in Sydney—in a sort of symbolising where I suppose we all finish up, whether we’re handicapped or not! The film has no narration. Someone said I ought to have a composer write a soundtrack, so I went to great lengths...working with musicians in a studio. It was completely new to me, and I wasn’t really comfortable with it.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":"/2gJn0SkkbQlmHw9YuuPEJVUKuLT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isolated","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"5ffbcb75383df2003b382984","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Comer","original_name":"Edward Comer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffbfa35fab3fa003d4e5384","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2gJn0SkkbQlmHw9YuuPEJVUKuLT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
