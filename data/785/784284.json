Over time his pain and anger turns into rage and despair. When psychoanalysis and depression drugs don't work, the young eccentric becomes morbid and introverted, withdrawing from society in a downward spiral to insanity. He not only sets his sights on an aspiring young actress, but on his psychiatrist and the doctor's family too. \"TODD\" takes you on a nail biting, edge of your seat journey into the mind of a budding madman.","popularity":0.6314,"poster_path":"/6vopUx5zHGLDilhcoF0tGkGN4pi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Am I The Butterfly","origin_country":""},{"id":147064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dangerous Curves Productions (II)","origin_country":""},{"id":51122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenway Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Odd man out!","title":"Todd","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Winslow","original_name":"Michael Winslow","popularity":0.7338,"profile_path":"/uSRS2MOI1fNFAdvUgrhatBvfsvv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"5ff91529bdd568003e29579f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2722687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliana Ghen","original_name":"Eliana Ghen","popularity":0.2761,"profile_path":"/xK4TJyBRiB3dAIZU5w0EIsOlCBS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen Franklin","credit_id":"5ff91534bbcae00040aee787","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Jackson","original_name":"Aaron Jackson","popularity":0.1198,"profile_path":"/gajMGmXfGPPJesTdAoz1MTuHFGA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Richard Miller","credit_id":"5ff9154791f0ea003f950684","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercedes Gutierrez","original_name":"Mercedes Gutierrez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Raven","credit_id":"5ff9155591f0ea003e94a7f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":197346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Hernke","original_name":"Hans Hernke","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/bubTM3GQYRQnReawypIHgha9YSu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Todd Platt","credit_id":"5ff91567dd83fa003e6d5b33","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3206198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloë Marie Rhoades","original_name":"Chloë Marie Rhoades","popularity":0.0783,"profile_path":"/h1JbPe5paCNwRfY3yCKYuJvEi41.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bar Patron","credit_id":"61de139d4c1d9a008d77c16b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Stetman","original_name":"Laura Stetman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cZXi2nW7d1qTGuyreJfD2sXTSaz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Amy Westcott","credit_id":"61de13c2a284eb00426956e3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatum Bates","original_name":"Tatum Bates","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bar Patron","credit_id":"61de141ae24b93008d48ea62","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Norman","original_name":"Jessica Norman","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bar Waitress","credit_id":"61de145ac525c4004238fe8b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Menz","original_name":"Jason Menz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Jack Midas","credit_id":"61de14ebc525c4008e5e452e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven M.
