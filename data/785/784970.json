From 1950 till its demise at the end of the 60s, Chess released a myriad of electric blues, rock 'n' roll and soul classics that helped change the landscape of black and white popular music.  Chess was the label that gave the world such sonic adventurers as Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Howlin' Wolf and Etta James. In this BBC 4 documentary to mark the label's 60th anniversary, the likes of Jimmy Page, Mick Hucknall, Public Enemy's Chuck D, Paul Jones and Little Steven, as well as those attached to the label such as founder's son Marshall Chess, pay tribute to its extraordinary music and influence.","popularity":0.2913,"poster_path":"/aq02ZOcv4AxAYB2TGaT48e4aJ18.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roll over Beethoven: The Chess Records Saga","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Seymour","original_name":"Lynne Seymour","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60403235e92d83005a720410","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naphtalia Loderick","original_name":"Naphtalia Loderick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"604032458a88b20059a8e0d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Tompkins","original_name":"Maurice Tompkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6040324b1dcb77005b967b44","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elis Williams","original_name":"Elis Williams","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6040325c1dcb77005b967b72","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osian Williams-Huw","original_name":"Osian Williams-Huw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"604032659e4586001f2addf7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Maycock","original_name":"James Maycock","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6040320f1dcb77002bfc1845","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1821013","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aq02ZOcv4AxAYB2TGaT48e4aJ18.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195162,"name":"record company"},{"id":337073,"name":"chicago's chess records"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
