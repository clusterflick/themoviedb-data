At the same time it brings up the need for a healthy sense of skepticism and the benefit of not believing in anything that advertises itself as certain. The filmmaker sets out for the USA, Japan, Great Britain, Poland, and the Balkans in his sometimes amusing investigation of spiritual substitutes, such as esoteric \"teachings” or various fraudulent and magical practices, to which we sometimes fall prey due to our natural religious cravings. In addition to a Czech \"prefab” family, who describe the carryings-on of their poltergeist, well-known mystery buffs appear in the film: Erich von Däniken, Raymond Moody Jr., and Ivan Mackerl.","popularity":0.2715,"poster_path":"/vmU9uWHKipZneMutfqC448xoqqF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkce Radim Procházka","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":116810,"logo_path":"/3igFASsdsc2UxMfVksd44YDRKpN.png","name":"atelier.doc","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2011-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":209,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obscurantist and His Lineage or The Pyramids' Tearful Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Vachek","original_name":"Karel Vachek","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/nRDeOkvHJpB8SZyC7n24xBDm4He.jpg","credit_id":"600fc1bed55c3d003e76b57f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2216341,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Petr Morávek","original_name":"Petr Morávek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fc1f4ea84c7003bb8d4df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Vachek","original_name":"Karel Vachek","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/nRDeOkvHJpB8SZyC7n24xBDm4He.jpg","credit_id":"600fc1af8ee49c003e6441f1","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223730,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Radim Procházka","original_name":"Radim Procházka","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fc204ea84c7003bb8d4eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mikuláš Novotný","original_name":"Mikuláš Novotný","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fc24346f354003eb3797b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362619,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Libor Sedláček","original_name":"Libor Sedláček","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fc25146f3540041b4508e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362615,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karel Slach","original_name":"Karel Slach","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fc2160cd4460040e4ebe7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362617,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Renata Pařezová","original_name":"Renata Pařezová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600fc22d0816c700417da3e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Vachek","original_name":"Karel Vachek","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/nRDeOkvHJpB8SZyC7n24xBDm4He.jpg","credit_id":"600fc1c70816c700407d5fc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Róbert Kirchhoff","original_name":"Róbert Kirchhoff","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/tvLURlYmFlj0PC36rlvd9WQELgQ.jpg","credit_id":"600fc1e5813cb6003f803dc1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2281389","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vmU9uWHKipZneMutfqC448xoqqF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
