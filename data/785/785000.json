With their signature perfectionism and dedication, Teodor Currentzis and the musicians have spent many hours rehearsing and recording in the studio in order to capture the true expressiveness of the performed masterpieces.\r Each of the recorded scenes will get its own visualization by various filmmakers who will create videos that reflect the concepts behind the music.  The first recording in the series is taken from Giuseppe Verdi’s La Traviata and is made in collaboration with NOIR Films (St Petersburg), a team of video artists that specializes in experimental films and video art.","popularity":0.1781,"poster_path":"/yFDa00rFSzFbfpF6rDisylvLiwa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments Part I – “Traviata” – Act III: Preludio, scena e aria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5ffde3c220af77003f1f6901","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5128877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadezhda Pavlova","original_name":"Надежда Павлова","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sS3mu0c93MfDt6XXAQVPszrs58I.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Violetta","credit_id":"6763c4c5713e9ff45bab1e05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yulia Sayfulmulyukova","original_name":"Yulia Sayfulmulyukova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"61ec303cea37e0009e8232b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Shapovalov","original_name":"Viktor Shapovalov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dottore Grenvil","credit_id":"61ec3049875d1a001b2f842c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","credit_id":"5ffc7452dd83fa003f70d0e0","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2808338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxim Eruzhenets","original_name":"Maxim Eruzhenets","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffc7b29c8a5ac0040b12994","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2808340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Kirakosyan","original_name":"Marina Kirakosyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffc7b391089ba003fca1d86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5ffde39ede11e5003ff2caf1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFDa00rFSzFbfpF6rDisylvLiwa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
