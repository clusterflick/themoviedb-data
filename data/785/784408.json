As such, it should be better known and considered part of the Beatles \"canon\". The footage shows everything from a John Lennon Museum in Japan to a John Lennon elementary school in Liverpool to his influence on the thinking of a former Communist from Georgia (of the former USSR). It is provocative and very well made with a serious contribution from Yoko.","popularity":0.8329,"poster_path":"/1I8FUPjshMnfmfOGHTcJ5HrSdz1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17179,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Arena","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When John met Yoko, Zen met Rock'n'Roll","title":"Imagine Imagine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"John, Yoko och Imagine","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff9c4c01c0435003fbb89a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jagger","original_name":"Mick Jagger","popularity":0.6912,"profile_path":"/r1uFIYnBCDhIlqNbiTS4nDrjHrl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff9c4ce097c49003e9bc32b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Ono","original_name":"Yoko Ono","popularity":0.4298,"profile_path":"/j254dQthJu2rR1DRXqRkvo1oUqN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff9c4dc383df2003d344d89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Voormann","original_name":"Klaus Voormann","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/iBbhQQaje3bxQqnvLiojP3r12rX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff9c4e191f0ea003f961d2c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Elms","original_name":"Robert Elms","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff9c4ec91f0ea0041949a45","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Baker","original_name":"Frederick Baker","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff9c4ffa0be2800408d79d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Baker","original_name":"Frederick Baker","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff9c4f9a0be2800408d79cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47023,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Boboschewski","original_name":"Alexander Boboschewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff9c513383df2003e3397bf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0834918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1I8FUPjshMnfmfOGHTcJ5HrSdz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"BBC","release_date":"2003-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
