Not surprisingly, Bogwood is also the \"Garage Sale Capital of the U.S.A.\"  When retirees Doris & Clayton Fenwick decide to empty their nest of retro-modern antiques, they set the wheels in motion for a frantically funny \"g-sale\" involving Bogwood's most avid garage sale junkies: Angela Cocci (an obsessive market researcher), Ed LaSalle (a beleaguered computer programmer and creator of the cult fantasy roleplaying game \"Caves & Beasts\"), Dick Nickerson (a retired star of the 60s sitcom \"Pot o' Gold\"), and BJ Harwood & Helen Ziegler (partners and owners of a trendy retro-modern antique store).  These colorful characters try to outmaneuver each other to score their ultimate garage sale treasure: an antique board game worth a fortune.","popularity":0.1152,"poster_path":"/7X8j2xVVv7IWICdu4L5USZSHsMk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bogwood Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"G-Sale","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessi Badami","original_name":"Jessi Badami","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffa74da66ae4d003d0fb585","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Burns","original_name":"Scott Burns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffa74e1a3b5e6003f35b77c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey Conway","original_name":"Tracey Conway","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2fiDpDNN85K7NvbMjVDLvwqIJrZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffa74e720af77003c18e38e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Dardenne","original_name":"Henry Dardenne","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"672ea1147fd724342a9006ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted D'Arms","original_name":"Ted D'Arms","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/gPQpUe86El0A5FXARkCaC2tJfe7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"672ea12c7fd724342a9006d9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randy Nargi","original_name":"Randy Nargi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa74ba097c4900409ede18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessi Badami","original_name":"Jessi Badami","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffa74cb7d5db5003f49b6b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randy Nargi","original_name":"Randy Nargi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ea0875c61562494890cba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0357686","wikidata_id":"Q5511917","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yNPocvoTd146U6dupgtM6sBLWNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7X8j2xVVv7IWICdu4L5USZSHsMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sarasota Film Festival","release_date":"2003-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
