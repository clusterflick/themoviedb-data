Before the night is through, he is visited by four ghosts who show him chilling portraits of his past, present and future.  As the sun rises, will he come to see the bitter truth of his selfish life, learning kindness, compassion and, ultimately, the true meaning of Christmas? Join Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim and Scrooge himself in this riot of music and theatrical imagination, to find out.","popularity":0.3561,"poster_path":"/eZz7o8P0Vi9PE9hl2yNPl8yCy4c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42148,"logo_path":"/7bVderKf6ebTLLZMp8no2Jrv70K.png","name":"Bristol Old Vic","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmas Carol","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hopkins","original_name":"John Hopkins","popularity":0.3679,"profile_path":"/9TzGfzTSvhKSTrN9nI9kIb5Lyq8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Scrooge","credit_id":"5ffb8286dd83fa003e7142ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewan Black","original_name":"Ewan Black","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marley / Scrooge's Father / Mr Fezziwig","credit_id":"5ffb84e477d23b003ef83467","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mofetoluwa Akande","original_name":"Mofetoluwa Akande","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Belle / Mrs Atkins","credit_id":"5ffb8508383df2003b37982f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane David-Joseph","original_name":"Shane David-Joseph","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Freddie / Dick Wilkins / Martha","credit_id":"5ffb852aa3b5e60040373767","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931242,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gwyneth Herbert","original_name":"Gwyneth Herbert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Musician / Ghost of Christmas Present","credit_id":"5ffb853fc3c89100416e701d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Readshaw","original_name":"George Readshaw","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Young Scrooge / Sue Cratchit","credit_id":"5ffb85610fb17f003e3ea6bd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931242,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gwyneth Herbert","original_name":"Gwyneth Herbert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffb84a11d0191003e9fb821","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Lyford","original_name":"Lee Lyford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffb846fe19de900401580db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Dickens","original_name":"Charles Dickens","popularity":0.5721,"profile_path":"/vuy9knaprX05bT4WNJki5iDPfsK.jpg","credit_id":"6802ddca5570cba9e1acfcb5","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1dU1KwwcEmGvuh06R50CPCVTrs3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eZz7o8P0Vi9PE9hl2yNPl8yCy4c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
