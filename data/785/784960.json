A fanatic reader, Huguito, recounts with nostalgia the years of the magazine's boom, the second half of the 80's, and especially its link with the alma mater of La Cerdos: the rebellious Enrique Symns. The Buenos Aires counterculture, the \"democratic spring\", rock, drugs, and the events of intense and erotic lives, are narrated by some of the journalists who wrote in the mythical magazine. The fan and the idol do not always go their separate ways, they meet in this filthy place.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7387Cq2UkoUYC5laK9AkDZYNE5k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"EspaÃ±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Este sitio inmundo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrique Symns","original_name":"Enrique Symns","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vcaWsxOso5pt94Czx7n0EvtS74U.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ffc2b24c8a5ac003fb0e857","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo de la Paz","original_name":"Hugo de la Paz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ffc2b3a1d0191003fa0bfa5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agustina Paz Frontera","original_name":"Agustina Paz Frontera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffc2ae347c9fb0040780006","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931830,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Agustina Paz Frontera","original_name":"Agustina Paz Frontera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffc2b0247c9fb003e7845cd","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":964,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7387Cq2UkoUYC5laK9AkDZYNE5k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
