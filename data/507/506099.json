After ten years of eventful relationship, man and woman have finally decided to say yes to each other in an abandoned railway station on the edge of town. It is the first evening in their new home. Everything is temporary, nothing is finished. The furniture has not yet been delivered, the heating is not functioning yet, the telephone is not connected, neither is the television. They are inescapably confronted with their own selves and with each other. And although, at least at the beginning, they fervently strive for love and harmony, the past catches up with them. When he, as always, seeks to withdraw by taking flight, he discovers that his key does not fit. He is at her mercy. Ruthlessly, they call each other to account.","popularity":0.257,"poster_path":"/nb6HGi2nlWWrRpY5E9Qwujpe2q9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Extrafilm","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das zehnte Jahr","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Ich liebe dich - Das zehnte Jahr","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Im zehnten Jahr","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Das 10.
