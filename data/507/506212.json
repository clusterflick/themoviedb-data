The war ended five years ago and nothing remains of the city. Massive bombings and intense fighting lasting more than a month turned the city, its docks, its arsenal, into ashes. Thousands of workers will build it up again, brick by brick. But with awful work conditions protests quickly arise and a strike begins. Violent confrontations happen during manifestations. Until one man falls.  The next day René Vautier lands at Brest clandestinely to make a movie about the movement.","popularity":0.1708,"poster_path":"/lgqExnF6BhrDwAAMguEDwObWywO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6973,"logo_path":"/6lqJgLZuP3M6kxFJ6RU2HLBbB7L.png","name":"Les
