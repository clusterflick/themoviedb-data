Saddened by this observation, we wanted to offer him a frame, both real and cinematographic, in which he could renew a dialogue that was interrupted at that moment. The choice of his interlocutor was immediately obvious: Elias Sanbar, Palestinian, historian, director of the magazine \"Palestinian Studies\", collector of images: an exile who archives the memory of his people: press photographs, album of family, postcards, etc. For Sanbar, the image is a proof of his identity. Daney spent most of his life watching movies, but has always refused to keep still images. On both sides, there was a very strong desire to confront these two attitudes in the face of the image and to make it, in a way, a parable of the North-South relations.","popularity":0.1393,"poster_path":"/kLyfKtXPEOe8dDIwxKLu88Vd2P7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conversation nord-sud : Daney/Sanbar","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Bitton","original_name":"Simone Bitton","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8b1e5cc3a36862e107e496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605077,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Poitevin","original_name":"Catherine Poitevin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8b1e6e9251410aae07bded","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kLyfKtXPEOe8dDIwxKLu88Vd2P7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
