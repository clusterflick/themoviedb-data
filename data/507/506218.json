Quickly promoted to vice president for his work during the day, while writing the novel at night, proves too much for Mitchell; fearing that he has \"sold out,\" he takes off on his motorcycle to \"get his head together\" early '70s-style.  Somehow, schlockmeister Jack H. Harris (producer of THE BLOB) took this film and re-released it as something sexy called SWINGING TEACHER.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/8KNViRrKq4sjxTkD5ixhCeCm241.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mitchell, Mitchell, who are you... your parents' son, or your own man?","title":"Just Be There","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Little Piece of Culture","type":"screenplay title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Stranger at Home","type":"proposed title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Comin' Home","type":"proposed title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Swinging Teacher","type":"re-release title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Feldshuh","original_name":"David Feldshuh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da75fafe6d3cc0013ad9e97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434280,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathy Fehn","original_name":"Kathy Fehn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da75fbe021cee00132c9c95","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3625450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8KNViRrKq4sjxTkD5ixhCeCm241.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Reissued with an R rating as SWINGIN' TEACHER","release_date":"1973-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
