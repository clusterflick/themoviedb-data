Jerry, who drinks, loves Lanie, a rich, beautiful cock-teaser. Their story is explicitly enacted before a live audience. The curtain rises as Jerry tries to talk Lanie into getting him off by phone! Furious, she rejects him. He’s heartbroken. He decides to hang himself, for revenge. As he clumsily ties a noose around his neck, his life, which has been lusty, flashes before his eyes. The audience groans as girl after fabulous wet girl appears.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mkeQ8xZOp5wNb0S4X6cMuYI7nvx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Command Cinema Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Stuff","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1135691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taija Rae","original_name":"Taija Rae","popularity":3.401,"profile_path":"/jmXGrJpAs2YwA6p6Ts9YSbDrWP5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Doll","credit_id":"5a8f0f489251412a6800242e","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1739010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Everett","original_name":"Robin Everett","popularity":1.502,"profile_path":"/5d7euK0DGCNBTw5aN3Jaiptlv1k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madelaine","credit_id":"5a8f0f4cc3a368668c00274e","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":558779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Summers","original_name":"Renee Summers","popularity":2.306,"profile_path":"/joJfRU8I3dVfPmrJEOz5mdqjstg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Suzanne","credit_id":"5a8f0f53c3a368668c002760","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":98373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Clark","original_name":"Tiffany Clark","popularity":4.029,"profile_path":"/aAwmRWYc5on92UXs0YHI2McEwlB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rita","credit_id":"5a8f0f5c9251412a650023a7","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1525910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel","original_name":"Angel","popularity":6.416,"profile_path":"/umNoEDPGQiueKxEoTnbw5o5MNkq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lanie","credit_id":"5a8f0f6ec3a368667f0025a3","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":558716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Heinz","original_name":"Annette Heinz","popularity":3.055,"profile_path":"/rfYBnghAqPbdMRPU4BwLcXhpDbA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tiger","credit_id":"5a8f0f810e0a2601310029b5","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":45007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Edwards","original_name":"Eric Edwards","popularity":3.247,"profile_path":"/NVfWLufRjMueposhVjwmZv0GuM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"5a8f0f95c3a36866720025e0","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":55648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Kerman","original_name":"Robert Kerman","popularity":6.311,"profile_path":"/kjQ8g1UBn4l1T8flT4qZ9OwbE2k.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Uncle Jack (as R.
