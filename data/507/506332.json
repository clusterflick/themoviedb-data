In 1948, Hay founded the Mattachine Society in Los Angeles; the goal of the organization was to establish a \"Golden Brotherhood,\" one that sought to redefine homosexuality as a normal, healthy way of life. The problem, Hay famously maintained, was not homosexuality itself, but the way it was treated by society. Dramatizations, photographs, archival footage, and interviews with original Mattachine Society members are all incorporated to tell Hay's remarkable story, one whose legacy continues to be felt in the treatment of gays and lesbians in culture today.","popularity":0.3949,"poster_path":"/wsfLIn6CyKlK6TnBYcRCZVv7sEW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope Along the Wind: The Story of Harry Hay","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Hay","original_name":"Harry Hay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de8e6cd954200044ef9552","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Dale Jennings","original_name":"William Dale Jennings","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de8c01a12856005eb13fdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Burnside","original_name":"John Burnside","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de8eaa4544af0074f7dea3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urvashi Vaid","original_name":"Urvashi Vaid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60de8eb99979d2007f49149e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2904033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Taylor Mali","original_name":"Taylor Mali","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60de8ed3d954200044ef9645","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Walsh","original_name":"Jack Walsh","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8f1c4544af005efdba88","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874669,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivian Kleiman","original_name":"Vivian Kleiman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8f314544af0074f7dfed","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52379,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Jones","original_name":"Tim Jones","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8f4b5690b5005e56b40f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781502,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marsha Kahm","original_name":"Marsha Kahm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8f88071650007e3f25dd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143280,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philippe Roques","original_name":"Philippe Roques","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8fb1cb9f4b00803242ca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dawn Logsdon","original_name":"Dawn Logsdon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8fec344a8e00287a504b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143281,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Clay Lipsky","original_name":"Clay Lipsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de900b6c449c005d25160d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12570,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Bjorngaard","original_name":"David Bjorngaard","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de90309979d2007f49176c","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Slade","original_name":"Eric Slade","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8b66849251410b0107b121","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie E.
