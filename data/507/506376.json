Parts of the recording project were caught on video by independent filmmakers Aaron, Seth, and Justin Howland, three brothers more formally known as 7 Fluid Oz. Productions. With just a little rough footage, On the Way had its start. Following the release of Ten Thousand Mornings, the Howlands spent nine months capturing Peter's engaging and dynamic above-ground performances at venues in and around Boston, including the beautiful 800-seat Somerville Theatre and the intimate Club Passim in Harvard Square.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rh0fpmdQ0eDP2KV1FdpQANUEZcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Mulvey: On the Way","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rh0fpmdQ0eDP2KV1FdpQANUEZcf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
