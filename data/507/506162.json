The short film documents a live performance, captured entirely in camera.  Bot & Dolly produced this work to serve as both an artistic statement and technical demonstration. It is the culmination of multiple technologies, including large scale robotics, projection mapping, and software engineering. We believe this methodology has tremendous potential to radically transform theatrical presentations, and define new genres of expression.","popularity":0.1716,"poster_path":"/a8aYruTTxq11yhjXRAtITiY2mQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creators Project","origin_country":""},{"id":101162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bot & Dolly","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Box","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Picard","original_name":"Joe Picard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8a6fce9251410b0106aabe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Read","original_name":"Nick Read","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8a6fbe9251410b4d06c7f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley G.
