Strangely enough, the subject of Wildbolz's documentary also died relatively young, the painter Erich \"Ricco\" Wassmer (1915-1972). Perhaps because it was prophetic, or because Wildbolz sensed his fate and truly identified with Ricco, the life of the artist is related with a captivating poignancy, from his privileged but troubled childhood in Germany, to his artistic triumphs in Bern, to his career-wrecking imprisonment on the charge of immorality, ending with his life-draining illness in France. Wildbolz portrays Ricco as a victim throughout, a man misunderstood by bourgeois society and despised for his pursuit of exotic experiences (which, by the way, included an obsession with naked boys).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7KoImNzXynJUcApu3k6ac8lVYCq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ricco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1981727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Wildbolz","original_name":"Mike Wildbolz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8b7e8ac3a3682dbf08d425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0385991","wikidata_id":"Q50329452","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KoImNzXynJUcApu3k6ac8lVYCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
