For more than 80 years, the city was dominated by iconic movie theaters that captivated audiences like no other. The Bolívar, Variedades, Atahualpa, Alhambra, Capitol, and Fénix theaters, among others, were the gods of cinema that, in their heyday, projected illusions, desires, and fantasies onto the big screen for viewers. This documentary is a journey through time, a reconstruction of that cinematic memory through testimonies, vestiges, and memories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Time in Quito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4285828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iñaki Oñate","original_name":"Iñaki Oñate","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fE8qm0Pl1mBhKDPB9Ni1AT7p5ay.jpg","credit_id":"68be20dfa04c22fb97947837","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4285828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iñaki Oñate","original_name":"Iñaki Oñate","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fE8qm0Pl1mBhKDPB9Ni1AT7p5ay.jpg","credit_id":"68be210360a33b65e3948241","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4285828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iñaki Oñate","original_name":"Iñaki Oñate","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fE8qm0Pl1mBhKDPB9Ni1AT7p5ay.jpg","credit_id":"68be211fb4b474000c1f5556","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4285828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iñaki Oñate","original_name":"Iñaki Oñate","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fE8qm0Pl1mBhKDPB9Ni1AT7p5ay.jpg","credit_id":"68be2152f4fc744e5198bc7f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4285828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iñaki Oñate","original_name":"Iñaki Oñate","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fE8qm0Pl1mBhKDPB9Ni1AT7p5ay.jpg","credit_id":"68be2167ae6c28830e9bc5ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38127099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
