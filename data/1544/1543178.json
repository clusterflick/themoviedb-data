On the way up, one of them gets lost. The days pass alongside a crafts vendor turned hippie, an elderly woman leaving an offering at the summit, a group of esotericists celebrating a nudist ritual, and among them all, an ET disguised as a human, voyeuristically recording these moments. Finally, signs of their lost friend bring them back to a reality where the party has not stopped beating behind their eyes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uritorco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1847741","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
