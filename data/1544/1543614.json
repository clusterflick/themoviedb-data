This may cause permanent damage to your ORBICULARIS OCULI (eyelid muscle) or it may beef it up to a super-steroidal level that knocks your glasses off your face all the time. This is probably the best way to prepare your eyebrain for SAVORY SELECTIONS, the most breathtaking assemblage of contemporary \"fucked-up style...and beyond\" animation since Winsor McKay rode Gertie the Dinosaur into the Tron laser getting bitmapped and reconstituted as a GIF backpatch in a cybersquat in a boarded up GameStop at the mall. If that doesn't sound like fun to you, you should have your ears pierced... with a katana blade, that continues on through your neck, because you've forgotten what 'fun' is.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/w0eiyYIdm45HtPaA3N09B0KpCuq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Savory Selections","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Ciocci","original_name":"Jacob Ciocci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6VJ8MRJkaSwHsfYxjjNLt02IUK.jpg","credit_id":"68bf5bc92e3ad6fd304e654c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Char Esme","original_name":"Char Esme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5bd60459e37f171bd0b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Lane","original_name":"Nick Lane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5bee8470119c921f629f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Mendelewicz","original_name":"Ben Mendelewicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5bfead9314daf68cf59b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Brown","original_name":"Melissa Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c139c3fe8147d1f589a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wednesday Kim","original_name":"Wednesday Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c27572c69d92498c745","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Lockhart","original_name":"Amy Lockhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c3d77e17450c398c375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Millard","original_name":"Peter Millard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c51b657aeb10a1f5b78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nino Mora","original_name":"Nino Mora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c61c7cfcca8619bcbd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Luedtke","original_name":"Daniel Luedtke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c7aae986077d29bcb45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael O'Dell","original_name":"Michael O'Dell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5c8d577236088a1bcdfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivo Stoop","original_name":"Ivo Stoop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5cae9dbd8458a28cfc5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devin Tamiazzo","original_name":"Devin Tamiazzo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5cbdb26a06207e06a59e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Echo Theohar","original_name":"Echo Theohar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5cce9209abec119c0ce3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Ting","original_name":"Ray Ting","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf5ce0cd29e6487206a4cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w0eiyYIdm45HtPaA3N09B0KpCuq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":651}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
