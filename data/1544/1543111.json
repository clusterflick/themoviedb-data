After launching his legal career in Baltimore in 1935, Marshall went on to win 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the U.S. Supreme Court , most notably the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, which ended racial segregation in public schools. In 1967 he was appointed to the Supreme Court, where he served until his retirement in 1991.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9io98sGYYkwc0RJl1RSjM3fVU8v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming Thurgood: America's Social Architect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Aggrey","original_name":"Alexis Aggrey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68be27d766584852359bc4ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lXxDqhd3nNsLDkSkG0JuDEIAqbY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2547,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9io98sGYYkwc0RJl1RSjM3fVU8v.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1698},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vGsFOOp4i1PdSI62drmEGC8Hw2g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2025-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
