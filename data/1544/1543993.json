At 18, they go on a pilgrimage outside the village, but some never return. Despite the village's perfection, why do they not come back? Unable to suppress her curiosity, Daisy follows the pilgrims and wanders the 'Origin'. Sophie, still living peacefully in the village, recovers forgotten memories of Daisy and contemplates why Daisy headed to the Origin. The restoration of humanity begins with awareness. In an era where advanced science suppresses individuality and commodifies humans, ironically, recognizing flaws and differences is essential to embody empathy and love. The children who leave the given peace to choose active lives will often suffer, but will feel happiness more often.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Pilgrims","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1627363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heo Pyoung-kang","original_name":"허평강","popularity":0.4289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c03d28572c69d92498cb66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
