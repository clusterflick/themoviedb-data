In the nave of the Grand Palais, two fencers face each other. Seated in their wheelchairs, they are about to cross swords for an Olympic title. From the edge of the strip, Delphine, also in a wheelchair, watches the event with a special perspective. She is providing live commentary on the final bout of Maxime Valet, the man she shares her life with. In his quest, Maxime can also rely on the unwavering support of his close circle: his parents, his coaches, and Brigitte, his fencing master since childhood, all of them pushing him forward.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":258028,"logo_path":"/c0dqpBjvsaVyimUjf1o9VO1s7K8.png","name":"Anoki","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":162423,"logo_path":null,"name":"viàOccitanie","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
