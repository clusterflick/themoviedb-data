The image burns – and yet something takes shape.  A figure slowly emerges from the black. On the screen, the director’s date of birth becomes legible: a lateral detail that reveals an origin.  What unfolds is a non-film conceived as an act of dedication, in which a paternal voice serves as both emotional and structural pillar. Affection and creative process intertwine in an inseparable gesture, where remembering coincides with editing, and editing gives new form to personal material. The image, then, doesn’t document – it bears witness; it doesn’t survive – it resists its own decay. As if remembering were the unconscious attempt to confront the open sea.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Premessa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5679755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elia Mazzini","original_name":"Elia Mazzini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c0104e572c69d92498ca70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
