He is now the star of the Angola Prison Rodeo. Each Sunday in October, inmates battle bulls without training for a few seconds of fame and some money. For Angola's warden, the proceeds of the rodeo fund the religious education of his inmates. \"Razor Wire Rodeo\" tells the unflinching story of lives defined by violence and crushed by the pitiless corrections practices in Louisiana. Jerry Brown believes his fame will help him to get out of Angola. But in a state, that hardly ever grants clemencies, his battle against the bull is symbolic of a fight for freedom lost a long time ago.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2nCbTsotg5mMLq8gT95U4Nj1ZhS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artemis Films Productions","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2006-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Wildest Show in the South!","title":"Razor Wire Rodeo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas Pallay","original_name":"Nicolas Pallay","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2ac09dbd8458a28cfb82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas Pallay","original_name":"Nicolas Pallay","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2acbb6a42c807c1f55e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Cosme Delaloye","original_name":"Jean-Cosme Delaloye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2ad810647f072c1bce65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Blanc","original_name":"Raphaël Blanc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2ae42382a0330b9c0a1d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678472,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Scott Crain","original_name":"Scott Crain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2afe29f4ce50344e6800","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678473,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fabien Meyrier","original_name":"Fabien Meyrier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2b0ca72100a4704e63da","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678474,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ivo Zanetti","original_name":"Ivo Zanetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2b1510647f072c1bce71","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678475,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Jaquier","original_name":"Ian Jaquier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2b2121a023df8a9c0e0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5678476,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yvan Hofer","original_name":"Yvan Hofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bf2b34f896fc684b4e63fb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0819116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":835,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2nCbTsotg5mMLq8gT95U4Nj1ZhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":231594,"name":"louisiana state penitentiary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RAZOR WIRE RODEO - a documentary by Nicolas Pallay & Jean-Cosme Delaloye","key":"24912400","site":"Vimeo","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-06-10T08:20:59.000Z","id":"68bf29fdcd29e6487206a3d4"}]}}}
