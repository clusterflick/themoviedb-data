Irish painter and social activist Brian Maguire has been catapulted to the forefront of the international art world in recent years as it has been realized how much his challenging work contributes to and tells the real story of the world. He tells the stories of those that have lost the race, the victims of poverty, drugs and violence. All of the elements of Brianâ€™s extraordinary life are rolled out in his artworks, experiences that have fueled his drive to bring attention to stories of injustice, stories which might not otherwise be told. He has brought his artworks to UN headquarters in New York and the European parliament to bring attention to what he calls the victims of capitalism.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uBZq0erpKxs24QLeVTtvA9KXbGS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bang Bang Teo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2025-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Follow artist Brian Maguire as he tells the stories of those that have lost the race - the victims of poverty, drugs, and violence.","title":"The Life of Brian (Maguire)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5679304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Maguire","original_name":"Brian Maguire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68bfa65838ae4bfab51f5a92","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5679305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark McLoughlin","original_name":"Mark McLoughlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bfa683fdd786ebf99c11a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5679307,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dara Jauch","original_name":"Dara Jauch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bfa69e6ebe98c71e4e660e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uBZq0erpKxs24QLeVTtvA9KXbGS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250},{"aspect_ratio":0.763,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uAA8xem1kWAVuI7MfqZ8VSAfUsv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/buf5HGerSf6WTDIO8vUns3qXVjI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2356,"name":"immigrant"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
