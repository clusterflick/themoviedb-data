Willutzki moved to the Märkisches Viertel (MV) in 1969, a large housing estate built between 1963 and 1974 for 60,000 residents on the outskirts of West Berlin. Together with Christian Ziewer and others, he documented the political neighbourhood work on the estate. The resulting »Basis-Filme« formed the starting point for the later Basis-Film distribution company. This film shows how the Arbeitskreis Mieten und Wohnen (workgroup rents and housing) succeeds in preventing the forced eviction of the working-class Puhle family, who can no longer pay their rent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2GqlvVIQWGWVmpTGleOTOm0T5Gd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mietersolidarität","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Willutzki","original_name":"Max Willutzki","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bef0a84acfe14e8e1bce92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2GqlvVIQWGWVmpTGleOTOm0T5Gd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kurzfilm Festival Hamburg","release_date":"2025-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
