Filmed over three years (2021-2023), including just weeks before the war began, it portrays life in Sudan during that turbulent time, blending scenes of peaceful daily life, protests, and resistance, especially during Ramadan and Bayram. Created by Sudanese activists and artists, the film sheds light on the overlooked causes of the war, challenging the narrative of a »civil war« and exposing deeper capitalist and colonial forces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"2025-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sabren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5677937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eythar Gubara","original_name":"Eythar Gubara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68beed36e5b0c6eb7d948007","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5677937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eythar Gubara","original_name":"Eythar Gubara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68beed3b64d278789b1f54ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kurzfilm Festival Hamburg","release_date":"2025-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
