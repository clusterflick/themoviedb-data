The Man in the Upper Room is a one-day documentary that captures the sacred solitude of one of cinemaâ€™s last keepers. Shot in a single 24-hour period, the film is both a portrait and a meditation: on ritual, on the fragility of tradition, and on the quiet hands that keep the magic alive.  As theaters shutter and celluloid vanishes, this intimate story asks a simple question: why does it still matter to gather in the dark and let light tell us who we are?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sIYIWMnyqb6TWtHKkkbxPY3R8H0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":273530,"logo_path":null,"name":"No Moss Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the dark, few keep the light alive.","title":"The Man in the Upper Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5677307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Pierce","original_name":"Chad Pierce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68be5ec598c17ea86d069fb4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3989007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Alan Stone","original_name":"Sean Alan Stone","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68be5edfbf527c93a54e62bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161849,"name":"projectionist"},{"id":331697,"name":"35mm film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
