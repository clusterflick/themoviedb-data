Whilst partial himself to a bit of cold turkey, particularly with some sliced up gherkin and a squirt of salad cream in a sandwich, it is banned in most theatre auditoriums, (apart from in the north east), because of it getting trodden into the carpets etc, and the cumulative smell. To avoid any inconvenience, you can now watch Arthur in the comfort of your own home filmed live during this never to be forgotten start to his farewell tour.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komedia Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Count Arthur Strong: And It's Goodnight from Him!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Delaney","original_name":"Steve Delaney","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/17ITAyOQSfQdIl4CVhqjXNeH00A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Count Arthur Strong","credit_id":"68c03359577236088a1bd2b7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Delaney","original_name":"Steve Delaney","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/17ITAyOQSfQdIl4CVhqjXNeH00A.jpg","credit_id":"68c03367e3d9f6469098cd5b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1777667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toby Reisz","original_name":"Toby Reisz","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68c0337665e6732d2f9bcebf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
