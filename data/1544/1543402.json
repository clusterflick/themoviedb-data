Patterns of Poverty","overview":"Relating to current discourses on class issues, Kerstin Honeit addresses social structures that lead to great economic inequality. In a poetic and resistant narrative created in cooperation with members of the Berlin Street Choir and her family, »decors of poverty« from the artist's milieu of origin meet the architecture of the Steglitzer Kreisel, a highly symbolic ruin of real estate speculation. The high-rise, finished in early 1980, housed once the district office, and therefore as well the social welfare office.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is Poor!
