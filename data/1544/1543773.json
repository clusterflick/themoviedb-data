Fedorov, a young man of Russian descent orphaned and raised by his uncle, graduated from a technical university near The Hague but, afflicted by worsening somatic symptoms, failed to secure work. Returning to Russia under sanctions seemed impossible. He wandered the streets, smoking cannabis and throwing stones at drunks. Within this self-made prison he met Helena, a Flemish girl, on an online forum. She lured him into smuggling soap and chemicals to the black market in Liège. The next month he met Helena and two female accomplices at Liège-Guillemins Station. Yet at their suburban hideout—an abandoned factory—he was forced into his first murder and dismemberment. Only then did he realise he had entered their abyss of crime, irrevocably damned. Where will their fates turn in the next manipulative, large-scale ensemble sequence?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"yarostoubijstvo","title":"yarostoubijstvo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
