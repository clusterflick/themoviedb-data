The girl shows a definite preference for one of the lumberjacks, \"Hell-to-Pay\" Austin, so he becomes her new \"father.\" Just as much as Hell-to-Pay takes care of Briar, she watches over him, and it is largely through her influence that he gives up hard drinking and needless fighting. Then, when Briar is old enough, she goes away to school and quickly falls in with the wrong crowd. Hell-to-Pay comes after her and takes her away from Doris Valentine, an adventuress who had been teaching Briar the tricks of the trade. When they are reunited, Hell-to-Pay and Briar realize that they are in love, so they decide to change their relationship from guardian and ward to husband and wife.","popularity":0.2501,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":36191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine Arts Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell-to-Pay Austin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hell to Pay Austin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Lucas","original_name":"Wilfred Lucas","popularity":0.3261,"profile_path":"/rr70uPoMMtkHFYSPn0JTwI9ikQ9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hell-to-Pay Austin","credit_id":"5fbc2a7f323eba003df95537","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Love","original_name":"Bessie Love","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/aOt4c5AoO1Zp8W93JTBnl1eEcFk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Briar Rose Dawson","credit_id":"5fbc2a8fd9f4a6003d97f4af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Lewis","original_name":"Ralph Lewis","popularity":0.2402,"profile_path":"/hcZEuTJlj57Eapbtp103IMq7DVP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dad Dawson","credit_id":"5fbc2aa7263462003d0d6daf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Alden","original_name":"Mary Alden","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/q17Y3cJppoRVSiAo5RHafRj2DuO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Doris Valentine","credit_id":"5fbc2ab59c97bd003e9cdcec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Pallette","original_name":"Eugene Pallette","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/y3n1c9qjmJzGeZWihwm0QWlmDoR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harry Tracey","credit_id":"5fbc2ac9071650003d88a2ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clyde E.
