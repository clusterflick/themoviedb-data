The past had been overturned. The new had not yet taken shape. The rejoicing over the fall of the Berlin wall. The bitterness and shame when the doors opened to cabinet of horrors at Stasi. Uncertainty and worry about the future. Everyone's battle against everyone for survival. In the form of a travelogue, freelancing journalist Rainer Hartleb depicts all the mixed feelings that flow from the country that no longer exists.","popularity":0.4454,"poster_path":"/3mJWjnCtVRWIb4JXU7gRSnnBpoH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95085,"logo_path":"/a2jrXBJdeqBhA1nMp37CqEQ1T3m.png","name":"Baltic Film Production","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1990-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Efter Muren - mellan taggtråd och kaos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bo Wargentin","original_name":"Bo Wargentin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c446cccae17c00c686bfca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Hartleb","original_name":"Rainer Hartleb","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/zbZyPe3wYPdDi3EQRGHrOCk9dZI.jpg","credit_id":"61c446f0e72fe8004174fa7f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Hartleb","original_name":"Rainer Hartleb","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/zbZyPe3wYPdDi3EQRGHrOCk9dZI.jpg","credit_id":"5fba48920792e1003e39a0c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Hartleb","original_name":"Rainer Hartleb","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/zbZyPe3wYPdDi3EQRGHrOCk9dZI.jpg","credit_id":"5fba48988de0ae00424b163e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Hartleb","original_name":"Rainer Hartleb","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/zbZyPe3wYPdDi3EQRGHrOCk9dZI.jpg","credit_id":"5fba48a2e2bca80041fa4a75","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2133,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mJWjnCtVRWIb4JXU7gRSnnBpoH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":292,"name":"berlin wall"},{"id":217133,"name":"post cold war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1990-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
