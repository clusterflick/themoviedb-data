They give water to local animals such as deer and help birds that fall into the water and cover their body with salt crystals. One of the rangers stays on an island in the middle of the lake and is unable to move his boat due to the high salt water. A boat comes to his aid at night. The birds of this lake are extinct due to the high salt content of the water.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xNCPcPkkvUwUhVxWIlhiO4C6gU3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2003-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867040,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ali Akbar Yaghubi","original_name":"Ali Akbar Yaghubi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb9d198de0ae00414d9208","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohsen Abdolvahab","original_name":"Mohsen Abdolvahab","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb9cf49a64c10040971470","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553415,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Morteza Poursamadi","original_name":"Morteza Poursamadi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wofHCBeRI2H1MOt6rxpT4iIttqf.jpg","credit_id":"5fbb9cdaa22d3e003efa1b2e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mahoush Seikholeslami","original_name":"Mahoush Seikholeslami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb9cc604b5960042f7df99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xNCPcPkkvUwUhVxWIlhiO4C6gU3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Turkish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Turkish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"tr\", \"native_name\"=>\"Turkish\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
