The film uses this montage of sounds to explore overlapping concerns on the ethics of image making, on legacy and inheritance and on the unspoken perils of patrimony and kinship.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genome Chronicles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Akomfrah","original_name":"John Akomfrah","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/9ok6rVjT76dmzzNzCUhpjhiMsZA.jpg","credit_id":"5fba97ba0792e1004039b244","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
