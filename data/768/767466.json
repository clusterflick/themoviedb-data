Never has scientific knowledge seemed so vast, detailed and shared. And yet it appears to be increasingly challenged. It is no longer surprising to see private corporations put strategies in place to confuse the public debate and paralyze political decision-making. Overwhelmed by excess of information, how can we, as citizens, sort out fact from fiction? One by one, this film dismantles the workings of this clever manoeuvre that aims to turn science against itself. Thanks to declassified archives, graphic animations and testimonies from experts, lobbyists and politicians, this investigation plunges us into the science of doubt. Along with a team of experts (philosophers, economists, cognitive scientists, political men, or even agnotologists), we explore concrete examples of doubt making and try to understand the whole process and the issues behind it.","popularity":1.243,"poster_path":"/lOQj2KEFKRklpwaQRTtBM0xeQBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":122678,"logo_path":"/eibONHTEwYEcEq4DOxN2FvKaWFW.png","name":"AMC Networks International Iberia","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":20498,"logo_path":"/f1IuC7TbBHlNHybw2TZn5R1p4sx.png","name":"Télé-Québec","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manufacturing Ignorance","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1738575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Vasselin","original_name":"Pascal Vasselin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"602f72ddcee481003f0d6795","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2983553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fani Hatjina","original_name":"Fani Hatjina","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/dTDQpKsTLiLSdJVCYTmA9ewleqf.jpg","cast_id":31,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"602f7a915be00e003d8a4576","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2983560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Groß","original_name":"Matthias Groß","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gtfqnjQ8JQayS7RwnIi5Y7Ykqee.jpg","cast_id":32,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"602f7c2109dda4003d10210e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2983563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linsey McGoey","original_name":"Linsey McGoey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/oHDCkCB2yhLWmVKgI0ZQOiTj498.jpg","cast_id":33,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"602f7ca809dda4003d1021a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2297990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Oreskes","original_name":"Naomi Oreskes","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/99q9OxW8LleFU4lLAffzatC5x1J.jpg","cast_id":34,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"602f7d1732cc2b0042846ce2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2983474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stéphane Foucart","original_name":"Stéphane Foucart","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ggveZTT7QfWs7M8GvEsSvl5PvpX.jpg","cast_id":35,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"602f7da3bbcae0003f23b206","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2983575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Collinet","original_name":"Catherine Collinet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":36,"character":"Herself (archive footage)","credit_id":"602f7eb609dda4003c104397","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanton A.
