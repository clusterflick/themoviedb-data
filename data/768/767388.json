A combination of documentation, acting by lay people, interviews and self-portrayals are used. It is shown above all from the viewpoint of black Africans and narrated by four natives. The chief of an untouched village high in the Mandara mountains represents the \"original\" Africa; Christophe Colombe plays the guide in his native village, Rhumsiki; an African who has visited Europe and has got to know white people; and finally, the famous poet, René Philombé, recites poems.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Grusch Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonjour, Capitaliste...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"René Philombé","original_name":"René Philombé","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5fba87391feac1003b8abe3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Colombe","original_name":"Christoph Colombe","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5fba873fa097dc003df5ad87","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heinz Ebner","original_name":"Heinz Ebner","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba8725a2d2e9003c8d1d35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Grusch","original_name":"Werner Grusch","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba872f04b5960042f61cba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Grusch","original_name":"Werner Grusch","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba86f2a2d2e9003e8cf8d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinhard Köcher","original_name":"Reinhard Köcher","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba8715a097dc003bf5ea81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Slama","original_name":"David Slama","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba870da2d2e9003c8d1d07","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"René Philombé","original_name":"René Philombé","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba87059a64c1003f952aaf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2865648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Grusch","original_name":"Werner Grusch","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba86f90792e1003f39eb06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23747,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claudia Rieneck","original_name":"Claudia Rieneck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba871d8ec4ab003c7a1b38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Viennale","release_date":"1982-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
