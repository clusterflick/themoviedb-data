Apart from a few childhood photos, he himself remains out of the picture. He visits a teacher who used to take care of him, and a gay childhood friend. Their combined stories—about exclusion and terror, but also love—paint a portrait of a small, somewhat oppressive community and a boy who lost his sense of security within it, despite the help he was offered. In his wistful look at the past, Barreto transcends his personal experiences; anyone can identify with his bittersweet journey.","popularity":0.107,"poster_path":"/rqcAsHKGSs2gWUZTBh44xMbngCF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130077,"logo_path":"/e3wIhHj6U5wstsnHJSQb1mgtkkM.png","name":"Vulcana Cinema","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5 Houses","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"5 Houses","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Luz","original_name":"Jessica Luz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634de2a01089ba007ab3da17","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365189,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruno Polidoro","original_name":"Bruno Polidoro","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":"/uJITK0YLuBSd3pWL2u5G2dOBjOg.jpg","credit_id":"5fba8192ca4f67004273ba81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1528341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emil Klotzsch","original_name":"Emil Klotzsch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba81738ec4ab003e79d46c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vicente Moreno","original_name":"Vicente Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/v0JH0OqYMwjI3fJi2udQFtJ1J7S.jpg","credit_id":"5fba814c9a64c10042959c23","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Gularte Barreto","original_name":"Bruno Gularte Barreto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/drKHvJLWH1L406un8VNSJPplUwq.jpg","credit_id":"5fba80f6ca4f67003f73a926","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1528341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emil Klotzsch","original_name":"Emil Klotzsch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba8183a097dc003df5a49b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Gularte Barreto","original_name":"Bruno Gularte Barreto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/drKHvJLWH1L406un8VNSJPplUwq.jpg","credit_id":"5fba81408ec4ab003f79fcbd","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vicente Moreno","original_name":"Vicente Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/v0JH0OqYMwjI3fJi2udQFtJ1J7S.jpg","credit_id":"5fba812504b596003ff5c9b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerd Haag","original_name":"Gerd Haag","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba81648ec4ab003d7a357c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13518332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWgDApthw5JqadE0iWp1QimSSDH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/rqcAsHKGSs2gWUZTBh44xMbngCF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
