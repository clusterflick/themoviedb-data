Their ethos is: “Where affairs of state are concerned, we cannot stand idly by and watch.” And yet the reward for their concern is a lifetime spent in political turmoil, years of periodic intimidation and surveillance. This film illustrates the perils of seeking freedom in a time of darkness, in a time when critique requires transformation. It depicts the harsh realities faced by three generations of activists—young, middle-aged and elderly– and allows us to better understand their anxieties, hopes, despairs and above all, their persistence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yxEugngAyx00HDpzw6ePpMgVapC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Wo men","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"We","type":"Festival English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wenhai Huang","original_name":"聞海","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb1aad15376c00402cd843","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1270706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1188,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yxEugngAyx00HDpzw6ePpMgVapC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":782}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"2008-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Göteborg International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
