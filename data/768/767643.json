Antonio is a veteran university professor with a quiet life, oblivious to everything going on around him. He doesn't read newspapers, doesn't listen to the radio, and doesn't own a television.

But everything is interrupted by the arrival of new and noisy neighbors who will not let him sleep with their screams.","popularity":0.081,"poster_path":"/r19CTCgpyMat9uhkspnMBptnBbF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Neighbors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Burlé","original_name":"Eduardo Burlé","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/tDJUTLspuhGfoKIt5HwerhF4cjx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Professor","credit_id":"5fbb68b2a22d3e003bf92483","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2003621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Eitner","original_name":"Stephan Eitner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/uRDUFKZS9SGzebM0m1yeo4bondF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Neighbor","credit_id":"5fbb68e28d22fc003f7d4be9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillipe Barnett","original_name":"Phillipe Barnett","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbb68fea2d2e9003e8e7312","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davidza Rivera Pincheira","original_name":"Davidza Rivera Pincheira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbb6913a2d2e9003d8e1250","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Figueroa","original_name":"Diego Figueroa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb69831feac1003e8c4f83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866898,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Parra Seltzer","original_name":"David Parra Seltzer","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb69c51feac1003e8c4fc9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866903,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"María José González","original_name":"María José González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb6a8d8ec4ab003c7bd58a","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024134,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francisca Aldunate","original_name":"Francisca Aldunate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb6aa5ad59b5003fcea6e1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866899,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Vergara","original_name":"Andrea Vergara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb6a24a2d2e9003c8ec284","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866902,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cheryl Marambio","original_name":"Cheryl Marambio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb6a6c0816c700408f192a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Poulain","original_name":"Pablo Poulain","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb6a591089ba003f0ee9fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866905,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego de la Fuente","original_name":"Diego de la Fuente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb6ab704b5960042f7b98d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Figueroa","original_name":"Diego Figueroa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb69e01089ba00450ed770","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7931466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":820,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r19CTCgpyMat9uhkspnMBptnBbF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":547}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Viña del Mar 2015","release_date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Los Vecinos (Cortometraje)","key":"4FWt-0mP9lE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-12T13:06:06.000Z","id":"5fbb6c710816c700408f1b49"}]}}}
