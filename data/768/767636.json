Through months of organizing and a series of escalating actions, working-class people took on the biggest corporate landlord in their neighbourhoodâ€¦ and won. In an age where gentrification is rapidly transforming the nature and demographics of working-class neighbourhoods in cities across the world, pushing out poorer tenants, people on fixed incomes, immigrant communities and other long-term residents, the story of the Parkdale rent strike offers an important and practical lesson on how we can organize with our neighbours to fight back.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/z7g67Lb1aldPH9Wh3LEO1meWeiI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54204,"logo_path":null,"name":"SubMedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is Parkdale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heatscore","original_name":"Heatscore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb59433a48c5003e16feac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heatscore","original_name":"Heatscore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb594d0792e100403ad09e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":931,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z7g67Lb1aldPH9Wh3LEO1meWeiI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":622}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
