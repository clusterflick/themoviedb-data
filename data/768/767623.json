This short tells the tale of a young woman who upon reflection at the beauty of Monetâ€™s water lily pond, slips into a daydream where she finds herself wearing pointe shoes and able to dance exquisitely. During this reverie she encounters a ghost like girl who guides her through the gardens, encouraging her to express her joy at the wonder of such a place through dance. By the end of their journey we are left to ponder whether this was in fact a dream or a magical ghostly encounter?","popularity":0.5924,"poster_path":"/xNJ4GwR5LHr6CC1vhwfLAj9mSYU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams
