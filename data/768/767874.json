With this unlimited money, poor little \"Waffles\" nevertheless has only three desires: to buy the little restaurant for her old benefactor, Shorty Olson, to publish the music written by her lover, Carl Miller, a young, eccentric, absent-minded musical genius, and to adopt the baby that a Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is too poor to care for.","popularity":0.2145,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":36191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine Arts Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heiress at Coffee Dan's","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Love","original_name":"Bessie Love","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/aOt4c5AoO1Zp8W93JTBnl1eEcFk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Waffles","credit_id":"5fbc2bef071650003f8899e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Davidson","original_name":"Max Davidson","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/yo57wZr0Fx0hyklCf0ykqPIOqVU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shorty Olson","credit_id":"5fbc2c17323eba0040f966e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Young","original_name":"Lucille Young","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/b22d4sw1eRVljNIlQS9MjLhlaug.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clara Johnstone","credit_id":"5fbc2c2e2dc9dc00423ba8a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bert Gallagher","credit_id":"5fbc2c3d271ca5003e4fc7c6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alva D.
