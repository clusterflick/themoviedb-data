In a battle during the World War, Douglas Albright has a moment of cowardice which causes the death of his friend, Captain Banning. When Albright comes back from the war, his fiancÃ©e, Helen Castle and her father, George, can see that something is bothering him. So Castle sends him to take care of business in China -- and to pull himself together. While in China, Albright runs across Bannings' widow, Breta, who has buried her sorrows behind a mask of revelry and fast living. Because he feels responsible for what she has become, Albright attempts to regenerate her and proposes marriage.","popularity":0.3821,"poster_path":"/cZHVKRTzf1eIAQECxyBvgXntYb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unguarded Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Breta Banning","credit_id":"5fba39d60792e1004039475e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dix","original_name":"Richard Dix","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/ptVgXv2JS1MoXU6Ok0aScPIY04I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Douglas Albright","credit_id":"5fba39e9ca4f670041737ca6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Astor","original_name":"Mary Astor","popularity":0.4766,"profile_path":"/g5iKOHKkpTAQUNOodgCEInrmtiU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen Castle","credit_id":"5fba39fea22d3e003bf7810a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter McGrail","original_name":"Walter McGrail","popularity":0.1382,"profile_path":"/ctOCxa0EQ6b2H2BL3d1BzeGyPaQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Larry Trent","credit_id":"5fba3a1a9a64c1004194f1fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Losee","original_name":"Frank Losee","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/360fNiKoqVmkDgDki3lGUfVdTfn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"George Castle","credit_id":"5fba3a300792e1003f397fd1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Lindroth","original_name":"Helen Lindroth","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/2FOgl5pOgxCBDziskrcqrfClbDN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt Louise","credit_id":"5fba3a4215376c00412b9289","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Mestayer","original_name":"Harry Mestayer","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/vMtnybKYcc6uxL2K92Rpfh4aFQB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sing Woo","credit_id":"5fba3a58ca4f6700427366af","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Hall","original_name":"Donald Hall","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/iZw060Ow8pzhs3DVLZrtVQLWHaV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"James Craig","credit_id":"5fba3a71a097dc003bf582ee","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe King","original_name":"Joe King","popularity":0.1751,"profile_path":"/wCQK5tVurkQL00FeDwW6nh3viLn.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Captain Robert Banning","credit_id":"5fba3a8104b596003ff579f3","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3240,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Ashmore Creelman","original_name":"James Ashmore Creelman","popularity":0.2125,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba2b70e72fe800615db60b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348754,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucy Stone Terrill","original_name":"Lucy Stone Terrill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba2ba5c616ac00668c2b7f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Crosland","original_name":"Alan Crosland","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":"/jqvqh7gg871bgsQxaZH0pJqtkue.jpg","credit_id":"5fba3a961feac1003d8aaefd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0015446","wikidata_id":"Q17066620","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKeNT1RvnEMwzU8FyVErujeACj3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cZHVKRTzf1eIAQECxyBvgXntYb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1924-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
