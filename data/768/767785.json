one.","popularity":0.2545,"poster_path":"/g2t7mSPGZ2yDjnrGsEokitdzT42.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flicker","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter
