Between 1943 and 1945, political prisoners from the Mauthausen concentration camp drove a tunnel into the mountains at an altitude of 1200m.\r To this day, two people have been linked by this tunnel: Janko Tisler was an engineer in charge of the building site in 1944; today he lives in Krize, south of the tunnel. Dr. Sigbert Ramsauer, the SS doctor of the camp at the site then, at the age of 80 still practises in Klagenfurt.\r Janko Tisler fights against forgetting, Dr. Ramsauer wishes he were forgotten. The history of the tunnel has become theirs as well.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prisma Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69908,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heinz Stussak","original_name":"Heinz Stussak","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda450816c700408fae24","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Egon Humer","original_name":"Egon Humer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda0aad59b5003fcf4151","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1809991,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Freiß","original_name":"Peter Freiß","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda160792e1003e3c5575","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48789,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karina Ressler","original_name":"Karina Ressler","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda1c0792e1003f3c0abd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867320,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Eder","original_name":"Hans Eder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda23fdfc9f003c73022c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oskar Knasmüller","original_name":"Oskar Knasmüller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda11e2bca8003efc9ea0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797891,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Othmar Eichinger","original_name":"Othmar Eichinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda2a8de0ae00404cf084","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867321,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Swatek","original_name":"Wolfgang Swatek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbda3a1089ba003f0f6d78","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0105656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
