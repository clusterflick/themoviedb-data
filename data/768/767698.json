More often than not, children are the victims of this situation. Not because they are killed but because they are made into instruments of death.  Children in Mozambique are abducted by the Contras and forced to act as murderers of their own people. Their traumatic experiences (abduction, torture, being trained to kill, flight or liberation) and the efforts of the Mozambique government to reintegrate them into society form the basis of this film.","popularity":0.1728,"poster_path":"/aBTkMg5C7uDwVUGTjkthM3y7VFg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Extrafilm","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MZ","name":"Mozambique"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1990-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is the Devil Really a Child?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margareta Heinrich","original_name":"Margareta Heinrich","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbafdfad59b50040cecbf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margareta Heinrich","original_name":"Margareta Heinrich","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbafe7a2d2e9003c8eff50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margit Niederhuber","original_name":"Margit Niederhuber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbafef15376c00402d8552","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margit Niederhuber","original_name":"Margit Niederhuber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbaff50792e1003e3c1567","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernd Neuburger","original_name":"Bernd Neuburger","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbaffca22d3e003bf94c3b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48789,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karina Ressler","original_name":"Karina Ressler","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbbb0059f51af003fd5d886","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932677,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul M.
