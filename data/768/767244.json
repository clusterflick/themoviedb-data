Now he's back to look at more recent work and to question whether modern art can still be shocking in its originality and understanding. In an age of media saturation it's perhaps even harder to tell what is good art and what is bad; but Hughes cuts through the marketing and the hype to reveal the art that is vital and will last; the art which defines the times in which we live. In a film which features interviews with David Hockney, Paula Rego, Jeff Koons and Sean Scully, Robert Hughes makes the case that painting, drawing, and the search for beauty matter more than ever before.","popularity":0.2541,"poster_path":"/8ZFAYyqlVEbmcMWdiLw3ggKLXu2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The NEW Shock of the New","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Hughes","original_name":"Robert Hughes","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/aQgqMJUsSS2iYXZihrWnYDHCori.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fb9dfac0816c7003d8c55db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hockney","original_name":"David Hockney","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/mUPzSASAKnpR9FjkUXz7LcOfKv5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e75a5abc86570068fa53ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2547193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Rego","original_name":"Paula Rego","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/m5Z6SPSidQfxnhYQmEZxfhfFFvq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e75a6e76484100430845e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Koons","original_name":"Jeff Koons","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/omhHKQPGdsnZ1clyX4k1x3gfu38.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61e75a7fcd204600bc6c47f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2288301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Scully","original_name":"Sean Scully","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6352198d9369a2008129d004","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Hughes","original_name":"Robert Hughes","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/aQgqMJUsSS2iYXZihrWnYDHCori.jpg","credit_id":"61499d57511d090043e9cf88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543383,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeremy Pollard","original_name":"Jeremy Pollard","popularity":0.0854,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61499e4522df2e00930977b4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Hughes","original_name":"Robert Hughes","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/aQgqMJUsSS2iYXZihrWnYDHCori.jpg","credit_id":"61499d6c2dffd8006685ff54","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280353,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Runcie","original_name":"James Runcie","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61499d917719d70044eadaad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280353,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Runcie","original_name":"James Runcie","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61499daaa6ddcb0062182082","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22884326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZ0HPaqgdAL095Kwm6V6beCtZ0C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8ZFAYyqlVEbmcMWdiLw3ggKLXu2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/to1JKk4u49Ikrgf4r3kuQaL5XTK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
