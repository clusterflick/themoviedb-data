In St. Pierre she finds that her father has died; his widow, who rules the island's French society, believes Zabette to be the child of a beautiful quadroon with whom Zabette's father left for France; when Zabette is sent to the mulatto quarter, Stéphane Séquineau is present and takes an interest in her. Destitute, Zabette is forced to auction off her Paris fashions, and though Quembo, a cunning quadroon, is the highest bidder, Stéphane outbids him at the last minute and professes his love, which she accepts, believing herself to be une fille de couleur; however, his older brother, Maurice, insinuating that a mixed marriage would ruin him, persuades her to desist.","popularity":0.318,"poster_path":"/9iEljVkgAAOevAHfJEpguvr2Wl3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volcano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Zabette de Chavalons","credit_id":"5fbbe15f15376c00412e2dd4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Cortez","original_name":"Ricardo Cortez","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/keRHNE7LFtrwnfJ6wTxrt4gyyxS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stéphane Séquineau","credit_id":"5fbbe177e2bca80041fd2146","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Beery","original_name":"Wallace Beery","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v8cHzbuHEqNUYmO7Oj66Im424uR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Quembo","credit_id":"5fbbe186e2bca8003efcaacc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Fuller","original_name":"Dale Fuller","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/bP9GxGcEopIOrC6kWblHeF1GVbK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cédrien","credit_id":"5fbbe197a2d2e9003c8f4810","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","original_name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/oU2gb8ZKlXfdze6JcLJCAQTH5i6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maurice Séquineau","credit_id":"5fbbe1b48de0ae00414df3ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eulalie Jensen","original_name":"Eulalie Jensen","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":"/jdWAELPJ5Q8W8HW8rLDLciVKdIN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Madame de Chauvalons","credit_id":"61bdf0fea6a4c1006141c8fe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Hurst","original_name":"Brandon Hurst","popularity":0.1654,"profile_path":"/fVpEO2PuRU2bNOK9XlEeRY9tiz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"André de Chauvalons","credit_id":"61bdf10c0443c9006005f3f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Whiteis","original_name":"Marjorie Whiteis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/ptBKmdymSbFYLNeRIuR5Y2JeDxD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Marie de Chauvalons","credit_id":"61bdf11d85b1050092f44a94","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Perry","original_name":"Bob Perry","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Père Bénédict","credit_id":"61bdf12ef28838001cc3a40a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snitz Edwards","original_name":"Snitz Edwards","popularity":0.1314,"profile_path":"/hZzvzPNMoo9FhvBTURdsuMKY1fR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Auctioneer","credit_id":"61bdf13d09ed8f00407c45ed","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2091833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Barrye","original_name":"Emily Barrye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qazs8CdCsl6Nkp4mtttx7D8kM2N.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Azaline","credit_id":"61bdf14a85b105001c4a5ca1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bowditch M.
