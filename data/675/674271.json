Starting with \"Chrisanthi\", the female narcissism--paired with fetishism and latent homosexuality--gives birth to emotional impasses, unchanneled sexual energy, and ultimately, erotic violence. Then, in \"Iason\", a young man torn between two women struggles to find his feet in an ever-changing game of twisted love. As unrestrained male passion takes over, the man attempts to reconcile the conflict between life and death and cope with rejection and self-destructive masochistic tendencies.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6tpT3uKvA5A81PGDMOy0Iyth5vy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":257875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiota Festa","original_name":"Γιώτα Φέστα","popularity":0.211,"profile_path":"/qpX8P7QNaoytrdzc9qicJsY3Q9I.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Χρυσάνθη","credit_id":"5e4bb89135811d00134c09be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giannis Zavradinos","original_name":"Γιάννης Ζαβραδινός","popularity":0.4272,"profile_path":"/iH0WLid99Up6etYDAP2CCGq0LLp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ιάσων","credit_id":"5e4bb8a835811d00134c09f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3816318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Kakarelidou","original_name":"Σοφία Κακαρελίδου","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/1qBcPeZn6no83arZGXW0ouWI881.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Αρετή","credit_id":"638dfbd17d5db50fb78cc7ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2051037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ifigeneia Makati","original_name":"Ιφιγένεια Μακάτη","popularity":0.0824,"profile_path":"/a3M6ewufK96e3GV59i7Xp5rky5l.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ιφιγένεια","credit_id":"638dfbeabefd9100ab63138a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hara Angelousi","original_name":"Χαρά Αγγελούση","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Άννα","credit_id":"638dfc0d8d77c4007c4b5575","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2540334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Gavala","original_name":"Maria Gavala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mpteeqPzlDNAVbg5PlznwE48H2h.jpg","credit_id":"5e4bb80535811d00174cbc41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540336,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theodoros Soumas","original_name":"Theodoros Soumas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4bb82f35811d00174cbc90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0288727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2099,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6tpT3uKvA5A81PGDMOy0Iyth5vy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1399}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1981-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
