Trips Festival: An Opening","overview":"Van Meter had three camera rolls of 7242 Ektachrome EFB, which he fully ran through his camera each day of the 3-day Trips Festival. The end result was three 100 ft. rolls of film that each had been triple exposed in-camera, each layer of exposure representing a day of the festival. Aside from just two or three necessary structural edits, Ben spliced the three rolls together essentially unedited. This was then set to a soundtrack that was achieved in roughly the same manner, via triple layering of sound he recorded throughout the festival; He calls the film “a documentary of the Trips Festival from the point of view of a goldfish in the punch bowl.”  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2010.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sBZR3j9nSI7IUL9e4EN5dkscuYY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.F.
