We had two reels, each with a head title, but no identification whether they were to be printed together, or projected side by side (which seems more likely). Parts of reel one have optically printed layers of fireworks, oscilloscopes, birds, etc. Hirsh reprinted images similar to those in Eneri, Come Closer and Divertissement Rococo. Reel two is a much less polished collage with live action shots including city windows, a marching band, monkeys, circus performers, Charlie Chaplin footage and Paris neon at night.
