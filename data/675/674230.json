The four stars are Courbet, Manet, Monet and Cezanne. In two hours their stories and their art will intertwine. Matt will unpack the principles of Impressionism - the strength of colour, the flatness, the patterning and the way in which ordinary life is pictured with startling truth - and argue that this is the best thing that has ever happened in modern art. He will also show that although the contemporary art world seemingly despises Impressionism it is only because of Impressionism that the avant-garde came to be.","popularity":0.115,"poster_path":"/8AntsulJsRrP08L7Rim90Sb1NZo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1421,"logo_path":"/uWCPDzKkQnOxQ5spgKpD8wzSIP1.png","name":"World of Wonder","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impressionism: Revenge of the Nice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247819,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Collings","original_name":"Matthew Collings","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4b894a2866fa00189ba3b2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247819,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Collings","original_name":"Matthew Collings","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4b89589b8616001865a858","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Rodley","original_name":"Chris Rodley","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/68s5Da7VJ8vcoUG3b4WWyq1jRDP.jpg","credit_id":"5e4b896c1e9225001ac645e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0988999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8AntsulJsRrP08L7Rim90Sb1NZo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
