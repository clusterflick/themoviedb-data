She soon becomes the center of attention and spoiled for choice when she finds herself wooed by no less than four handsome suitors, three of whom are very wealthy and prominent men. Initially torn between her head and her heart, but mindful of past mistakes, Carmina's character chooses love over money and picks a humble and hard-working waiter. Directed by Juan Orol, (Carmina's soon-to-be ex-husband in real-life), this drama features the long, drawn-out scenes and shadowy film noir techniques which he became well- known for.","popularity":0.3799,"poster_path":"/7wjfD0ffCuJ8c84cuUAHZDog3VG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77685,"logo_path":null,"name":"España Sono
