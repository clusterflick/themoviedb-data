By 15 he had secured funding from VC’s to build a new tech startup. So Ben dropped out of school and convinced his parents to let him live alone in NYC to lead his new company. A master at growth hacking with a strong eye for design, Ben was committed to making the world’s next big social app. But after running out of money, and confronting controversies that pushed him to the edge of sanity, Ben rebooted his career at 19, finding a new and unexpected purpose. The Boy Who Sold The World is a modern coming-of-age story that illuminates the inner workings of the tech industry from a rare and highly personal lens.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":"/7Vh90MSkwuJCtfE0lQHX9tqDVPP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152403,"logo_path":"/uXP4rNWDgbU7XKLQSgOkTO3um30.png","name":"Resonant Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113634,"logo_path":"/7ViBFQPmKYxSmfTQ0WC1RPFRQJ.png","name":"Library Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy Who Sold The World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Pasternak","original_name":"Ben Pasternak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610484b0688cd000468feef2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Barton","original_name":"Adam Barton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610484c517c443002daaff95","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Bathrick","original_name":"Sam Bathrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610484d87d5f4b00743609f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2757429,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alex Cullen","original_name":"Alex Cullen","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/gddJkwNC1Ww6T2m3pJEc0ZMBv6E.jpg","credit_id":"61048504ad87f7002ff7bf8e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Smith","original_name":"Chris Smith","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":"/w7YxLmX6901brkneH06nxPBSmji.jpg","credit_id":"610485384284ea00463e5657","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066809,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Turner","original_name":"Jack Turner","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104857a23d2780046111629","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Barton","original_name":"Adam Barton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104859d17c44300468b6e5f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180916,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Mink","original_name":"Sam Mink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610485a68ee49c004657cf33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Barton","original_name":"Adam Barton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4e87e79a3c4900163757ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11718522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2FqRaa9hJWn40rjGBtD3QjmWNAF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7Vh90MSkwuJCtfE0lQHX9tqDVPP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
