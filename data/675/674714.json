Using the newest For the Strength of Youth pamphlet, John Bytheway outlines the standards in a direct honest and clear fashion, yet he delivers the message in such a way that youth and adults alike don't feel lectured or preached to, but motivated and excited to live their lives on a higher plane.  Also included on the DVD is a fun “mini-concert” featuring some of John Bytheway's guitar playing and Primary song parodies including his rousing version of “Popcorn Popping” and “Choose the Sprite.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jLOK4WLqo2hIP7CzaSkz2nteWYJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deseret Book","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standards Night Live","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.689,"height":1859,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLOK4WLqo2hIP7CzaSkz2nteWYJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
