As the number of victims grew, investigators created a taskforce and enlisted the help of the FBI, but it took almost 20 years to finally catch their man. Through startling and chilling tapes and video archive of Gary Ridgway’s police interviews, The Green River Killer: Mind of a Monster reveals, in Ridgway’s own disturbing words, insight into his evil: from how his troubling behavior as a child morphed into his morbid motivation to murder as many women as possible.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":"/3fknFoz9o7RLzsBngvegoQE7xU5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67302,"logo_path":"/3xfDii9VwPHRj9nVZhJAPXRA1hN.png","name":"Arrow
