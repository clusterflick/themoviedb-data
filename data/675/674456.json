It is in this setting that Sylvia Kamutjemo (Girley Charlene Jazama, who also produces), a black domestic worker, meets Afrikaner police officer Pieter de Wet (Jan-Barend Scheepers) on a routine passbook check. As the pair exchange letters and a story of forbidden love across racial lines unfolds, Kahikopo explores an underrepresented period of Namibian history with compassion and hope.","popularity":0.1499,"poster_path":"/hpvxEiVlFiguvmSKSjWIIcIV4I9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6579,"logo_path":"/c9nKtU6qWaG2c6tlqVMU5WnuNIL.png","name":"Namibia Film
