Maciunas is also recognized as the force behind the transformation of New York's SoHo neighborhood into an artists' district. In Kubota's ongoing video diary, she observes Maciunas as he tours SoHo buildings with Fluxus artists and friends, including Nam June Paik, Barbara and Peter Moore, and Yoshi Wada.
