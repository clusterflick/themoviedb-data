The film begins with the words \"Last year, my grandfather died,\" and the filmmaker turns his attention to his grandmother, who is left behind. She says she could die at any time, but she lives on. The artist's fingers crawl over the grandmother's face, caressing the wrinkles. Her mother supports her as she gives her a bath. The artist, who says that one cannot avoid one's own blood or family when thinking about oneself, tries to question one's own existence by looking at the grandmother.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/f4Wr8UMtgeB4x5b5fyjYmvBLkRs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home, Return To","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","title":"Family Return","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishii Yuji","original_name":"Ishii Yuji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6211439089b5610042272831","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishii Jun","original_name":"Ishii Jun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62114399f6fd18001c34dfff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishii Ryoko","original_name":"Ishii Ryoko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621143a0e72fe80043b594ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishii Miki","original_name":"Ishii Miki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621143a744a4240046c7dcc5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideto Ishii","original_name":"Hideto Ishii","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621143779f1be7004487fe49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideto Ishii","original_name":"Hideto Ishii","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114366e0ca7f001b704e73","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideto Ishii","original_name":"Hideto Ishii","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6211436ba84ff70020d591db","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideto Ishii","original_name":"Hideto Ishii","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4c02222866fa00129c0e36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4Wr8UMtgeB4x5b5fyjYmvBLkRs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
