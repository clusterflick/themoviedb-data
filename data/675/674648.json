Through a fantasy narrative of self-discovery,  a neighborhood kid starts seeing apparitions of ancestors of the past in the old ruins of the area after falling into a concussion while playing soccer with his friends. Through this journey, we celebrate the architectural beauty of the aging process of the area, textures upon textures of old paint and rustic walls, and fallen ruins decorate an area that is in desperate need of love and care during it's aging process. It is a film that celebrates the beauty of aging. The film ties the past and present of the buildings through a historical timeline of the people who have in inhabited it in this dreamy narrative.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zAEQDmyLxhNnDMwqI2THocTaxbt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remember
