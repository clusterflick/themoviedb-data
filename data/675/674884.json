Over the course of a year, we follow the weekly meetings and get close to Kimmy, Nicky, Peter, Nora, Nolan, and Mikayla and their close companion: grief. It is sometimes heartbreaking, but also humorous, to experience the questions about life and death through their open and curious minds.  Grief is high and heavy as a mountain, but it helps you understand what has happened, and that death is irreversible.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/uD7yfR9n61k79NJn7hRu782nAz8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88293,"logo_path":"/q4uunfEJRQhTfzFdAFfC6zMvqPo.png","name":"Good Company Pictures","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":147938,"logo_path":"/5USotp1QuLWIHaJM4p6ODbuTB40.png","name":"MTV Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2020-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Something Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katrine Philp","original_name":"Katrine Philp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zLlLUU4v5viyLt1VTMQFt8Zveo0.jpg","credit_id":"5e829bd4cb6db50012b0ea4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1784715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katrine A.
