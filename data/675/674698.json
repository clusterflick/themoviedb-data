Blurring the line between tradition and creating something new- this work looks at the evolution of artistic practice. Hazy visuals enter the process of creative ideas with such art forms as dancing, drawing, and photography. At an audio standpoint, the score goes through a similar creation by being a recording of a guitar pluck being altered into an atmospheric synth and overlaid with field recordings of art making. The piece takes into account the various ideas and thoughts that go into artistry, and lead the viewer from the traditional aspects of preparation and through to the breaking of tradition to create something unique and personal to the artist.","popularity":0.3629,"poster_path":"/7HcLiQBpEAFmu2oQm39oNJTVSVF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Vision, Finding Voice","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2543309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Korch","original_name":"Grace Korch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2QxXhHqJgFshRSEBvC0sPIXojuE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e4dc27ea93d250013428f94","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"5e4dc29d35811d00134f25c9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4dc38c54a0980018072e01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4dc33d54a09800110719b6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4dc376283ed900135d0f37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4e2259a93d250013435c9d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4dc2da9a3c49001635f995","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4dc313a93d250013428ff7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Sizemore","original_name":"Jacob Sizemore","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iD19P1RpxDtLqiGHl4QhJ3sqdJX.jpg","credit_id":"5e4dc2c41e9225001ac99be6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ySWW5QFQUATo5kHgNLTKn4XID8S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yeoctW4l1kq19E7liHHW2vVXwih.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mG4VGPF8PPr2qjqNiR3GA9FJRxb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7HcLiQBpEAFmu2oQm39oNJTVSVF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"findingvisionvoicefinal-draft001","key":"35g1qYcA2_c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-13T22:50:56.000Z","id":"5e4e2277a93d2500174344a2"}]}}}
