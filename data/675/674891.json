It's a question that haunts Walt (Jim Tavaré), the owner of Essential Music, an indie record store in the heart of Silver Lake. Walt's all too aware of how his punk-rock glory days are fast fading in the rear-view - even as he can't help recounting war stories to his much younger employees: Lysette (Kate Dalton), who has to contend with a parade of customers convinced she's the Record Store Girl of their dreams; Chris (Derek James Elstro), the lead singer of Troubled Meats, a band poised for takeoff, and maybe not just in Chris' mind; and well-meaning music nut Duane (Adam Weber), who's a little too fluent in Rock Critic for his own good. With a love of all types of music evident in every shot, WARMED-OVER KRAUTROCK is a comedy for anyone who's ever spent too much time obsessing over playlists - and for anyone who's ever been driven crazy by that type of person, too.","popularity":0.1464,"poster_path":"/e9sZQ7s4rwG0ItjLLPKnXXvVVY2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warmed-Over Krautrock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Tavaré","original_name":"Jim Tavaré","popularity":0.4237,"profile_path":"/jgQJJLXNzk4syPacyxIxyC21J3y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e9737a93d250017445419","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1392771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Dalton","original_name":"Kate Dalton","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":"/nLoHDEngS8NLNmYbMpoBdPlQpvB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e9745a93d25001744543f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek James Elstro","original_name":"Derek James Elstro","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e9776a93d25001543d8f3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Weber","original_name":"Adam Weber","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e4e97919b861600186aab07","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Tompkins","original_name":"Mark Tompkins","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4e9702283ed900135ebf2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Tompkins","original_name":"Mark Tompkins","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4e9714283ed900195e9b7f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4768338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVTlrjyGffGeIuQuP1byg7l6zV0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qQyeZKaZ6BhATWxv9gqowE64b0v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.059,"height":1056,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ueG27ceLOgczkatul2GrajFowwe.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":4286}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e9sZQ7s4rwG0ItjLLPKnXXvVVY2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
