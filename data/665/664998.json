Filmed in Thompson and Portage La Prairie, Manitoba, and West Bay Reserve, Ontario, the film introduces the women who operate and use various types of accommodation such as transition houses, transition apartments, and safe houses. The shelter on West Bay Reserve is singled out as a project that was built by women for women to stand as a reminder that the Reserve will not tolerate violence against women. A Safe Distance is part of the The Next Step, a 3-film series about the services needed by and available to battered women.","popularity":0.2058,"poster_path":"/rLI7rVmoCocr5L40iuGU18GOm0A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Safe Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Next Step: A Safe Distance","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Dressel","original_name":"Holly Dressel","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5e23b88dbfeb8b0013d26b60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Magny","original_name":"Michèle Magny","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61d0f8738ee49c00a07341d7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691690,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zoe Dirse","original_name":"Zoe Dirse","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d0f855f9a3fb001a74728b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Horne","original_name":"Tina Horne","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b5ca1bf2660014f99b2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1853004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerry Rogers","original_name":"Gerry Rogers","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b75e8f26bc001177c69d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Horne","original_name":"Tina Horne","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b7688f26bc001377c101","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1639600,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kathleen Shannon","original_name":"Kathleen Shannon","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b7941bf2660014f9a076","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2514086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norma Denys","original_name":"Norma Denys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b7e1397df000169c77fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198529,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sidonie Kerr","original_name":"Sidonie Kerr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b7f61bf2660014f9a10c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":75008,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jackie Newell","original_name":"Jackie Newell","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b847bfeb8b0015d2c2ce","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Judith Gruber-Stitzer","original_name":"Judith Gruber-Stitzer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e23b87d8f26bc001177c969","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0237348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":958,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rLI7rVmoCocr5L40iuGU18GOm0A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
