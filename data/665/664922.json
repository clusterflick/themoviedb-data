Everything in his films has an equal presence; it is an animistic world. The nature of his reality is nothing but flux, and everything flows in the space. It is not a dream but the hyper-reality of his gaze and mind dissolving boundaries between the internal and external.' - Aki Onda","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/iwqwjIdN9Fk6fd0vical6IUIzQ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Visible the Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2513802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aki Onda","original_name":"Aki Onda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2340b21bf2660014f8e5cb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Clipson","original_name":"Paul Clipson","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/4ecKNR4AJhTel2ttjaACIoryRgc.jpg","credit_id":"5e23409fcf4b8b0017f458eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iwqwjIdN9Fk6fd0vical6IUIzQ1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iA7syqXT7GMUO8lhZEOMxz0EzRF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2qTd2OHn9z3ver6ETCTtBuZl87.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4v6Ssgqv58jsDBK9DdNKUFuSO5F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Aki Onda & Paul Clipson \"MAKE VISIBLE THE GHOST\"","key":"354235014","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-16T15:37:46.000Z","id":"6285055abf09d100ab49c463"}]}}}
