Using an object of religious might, the Keys of Solomon, he compels a demon to eliminate all those who oppose him. Lost for centuries, they have been the most sought artifacts by the church, since the Ark of the Covenant. The Jesuits, the defenders of the faith, have been entrusted with the task of reattaining these prized possessions.........at any cost. Caught in his wake of bloodshed is Zack Alder, a press representative for the governor. He, with the help of officer Lynn Russell, races against time to learn the truth and ultimately stop the governor from achieving his political resolve.","popularity":0.3392,"poster_path":"/1Suwmm8m2wWVsVsUppXxSGQ0clQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raising Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael F.
