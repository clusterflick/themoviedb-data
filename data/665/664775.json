Deconstructing an episode of TV's Miami Vice that features crude representations of Latino drug dealers, Labat constructs a multilayered psychological drama of converging realities. In a studio (the space between \"cut\" and \"action\"), artists Tony Oursler and Winston Tong provide commentary. Playing out a tragic drama with dolls, Tong also tapes his eyelids down and applies make-up, transforming himself from Asian to Caucasian, male to female. In a final confrontation of identity, Tong steps through the enlarged television image, devoid of masks or make-up.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cjvxrJaFn2GIhCtOQUcZ9NtMbkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mayami: Between Cut and Action","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2513252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Labat","original_name":"Tony Labat","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2286a78f26bc0013756de1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1076,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cjvxrJaFn2GIhCtOQUcZ9NtMbkR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
