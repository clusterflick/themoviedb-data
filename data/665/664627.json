The music throughout is by Kraftwerk. \"Raster relief,\" a work in two parts, provides a conceptual literalization of the terms raster (video) and relief (sculptural and difference from the ongoing). The look of this work is dedicated to the \"isms\" of modern painting and sculpture and the respective pioneers of abstraction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xkOgo1AEJ6FywZcScbZ11hWqm95.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avant Coureur / Raster Relief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2512948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Hornbacher","original_name":"Sara Hornbacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e21e0048f26bc001174675b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xkOgo1AEJ6FywZcScbZ11hWqm95.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
