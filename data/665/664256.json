Jacobs contrasts a lush natural space with the alienating, chaotic, and yet seductively beautiful aesthetics of his editing, which flattens and abstracts the image. At once violent and hypnotic, Walkway continues Jacobs' investigations into the relationship between space, light, and the optical illusions made possible by the interaction between images and the human brain.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/2zHzCZIZKGzkMKG65J0RDHyk7np.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walkway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"5e1ff312b3316b0015027864","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2zHzCZIZKGzkMKG65J0RDHyk7np.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
