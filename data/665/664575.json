The piece draws from the notion of macrocosm/microcosm as originated by the 16th century theologian Robert Fludd. Macrocosm and microcosm are terms from religious esotericism that refer to a vision of the cosmos reflected within a smaller part of itself. As Above, So Below is made with everyday materials to draw parallels between micro and macro â€“ the commonplace and the divine.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Above, So Below","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cooper Holoweski","original_name":"Cooper Holoweski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e21c59e397df0001698ad34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9064942","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
