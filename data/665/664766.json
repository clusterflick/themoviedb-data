The possibilities of vibration and sound are explored through a range of scavenged materials: old bed-springs, metal coils, piano strings, heated metal bars, dropped into water. In the tape's most striking image, a burning chair twists and turns from a cable, as if a symbol for some unexplained spontaneous combustion of domestic objects. While the video uses an almost process-oriented approach, showing the concrete techniques, which create each sound and effect, the elements are brought together in a composition that is almost musical.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vQDyNp6jR2qBRV96MVHkUQjQwcQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thought Crimes in the Satiation Pool","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2513263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barney Haynes","original_name":"Barney Haynes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e227ffc397df0001299ace6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vQDyNp6jR2qBRV96MVHkUQjQwcQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Thought Crimes in the Satiation Pool\" Barney Haynes | Barry Schwartz 1987","key":"19991981","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-15T21:38:02.000Z","id":"644d237d2d37211e0800fd9b"}]}}}
