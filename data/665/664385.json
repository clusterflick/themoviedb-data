A story about a group of elders in a ghost town and their lifetime struggle for the respect of their culture and their different ways of understanding faith, where the need of water is the main element that supports their demands and ancient culture is presented as an heritage for new generations to come, that if their home town survives after they are gone. A film that portrays youthfulness as hope, while the main characters reminds us all that nothing is more powerful than our own will and that there is no such thing as a lost cause.","popularity":0.4239,"poster_path":"/sg5cjdxFOih6EduSIcA21Gn4NJM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmarte","origin_country":"EC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2018-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacachun","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624016,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","original_name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cf657bb39e350056bfffbf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Ortuño","original_name":"Diego Ortuño","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/wSMTJQvxxn1byvNmx4P3vw7Bo2s.jpg","credit_id":"62cf66b86dc507004c6b25c3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378098,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcelo Castillo","original_name":"Marcelo Castillo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cf66c6b234b900540d0fbc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623065,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Inti Galarza","original_name":"Inti Galarza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cf66d1b234b9005ebed281","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623066,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Diego Del Corral","original_name":"Diego Del Corral","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cf66e56c449c004ea2a74f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1967401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Paez Hernandez","original_name":"Gabriel Paez Hernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yRShjgt1yLQ4M6fJId800JcVQsf.jpg","credit_id":"5e2094bc3dd1260014b34e78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Rodas León","original_name":"Isabel Rodas León","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2094d3f04d010017108e1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2511804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carolina Rodas","original_name":"Carolina Rodas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2094f8b3316b001103e2aa","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1967401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Paez Hernandez","original_name":"Gabriel Paez Hernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yRShjgt1yLQ4M6fJId800JcVQsf.jpg","credit_id":"5e209516f04d01001510248a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1967401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Paez Hernandez","original_name":"Gabriel Paez Hernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yRShjgt1yLQ4M6fJId800JcVQsf.jpg","credit_id":"5e20952df04d01001310dc63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624016,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","original_name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e20955cf04d010017108f73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8825182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cC13JBmPQbQQMFxcj7ijdjNdrHp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sg5cjdxFOih6EduSIcA21Gn4NJM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1740,"name":"pop culture"},{"id":2618,"name":"miracle"},{"id":194430,"name":"small village"},{"id":252797,"name":"elder"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER SACACHUN","key":"TdrvJQbXzw4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-17T21:10:26.000Z","id":"5e2096223dd1260014b35354"}]}}}
