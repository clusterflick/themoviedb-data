He must keep this power secret from those who might use him â€“ or destroy him. When his daughter purchases an antique mirror in a thrift shop, she unwittingly opens a gateway for a demon from the Abyss to enter our world. The fiend uses his sorcery to manipulate Micah's friends and family in an attempt to turn him to evil. Drawing on the strength given him by God, Micah challenges the demon to a final confrontation that will shake the boundaries of Heaven and Hell.","popularity":0.2984,"poster_path":"/cBYIDd7PHurGwz9PPSrerPoaoeg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young man descended from the angels does battle with a demon from the Abyss...","title":"Angel's Descent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Souls","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2512951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johnnie Baker Jr.","original_name":"Johnnie Baker Jr.","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ywZiOib8hrJNv3E7H80By8vw2I9.jpg","credit_id":"5e21e3978f26bc0011746cb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2512951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johnnie Baker Jr.","original_name":"Johnnie Baker Jr.","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ywZiOib8hrJNv3E7H80By8vw2I9.jpg","credit_id":"5e21e3a58f26bc0011746cbd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":981,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cBYIDd7PHurGwz9PPSrerPoaoeg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276,"name":"philadelphia, pennsylvania"},{"id":6150,"name":"faith"},{"id":15001,"name":"demon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"AMC Theatre Loews-Cherry Hill","release_date":"2018-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
