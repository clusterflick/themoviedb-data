The frame of the image shifts from vertical to horizontal and then slowly rotates 360 degrees, adding a layer of more superficial movement to the pulsating, shifting colors of the stream. Thus foregrounding the image as constructed, flat surface, Brook is impressionistic and painterly in a way that much of Jacobs' work gestures at, but rarely fully embraces.","popularity":0.1482,"poster_path":"/3ZSAnv03yvGxziFVB0QtpIr5WHu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brook","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"5e1ff02ae004a60013980a15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZSAnv03yvGxziFVB0QtpIr5WHu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
