Unfolding alongside these scenes are an array of newer traditions: lockdown drills, teacher firearm trainings, metal detector inspections, and school safety trade shows. This documentary weaves together these moments in a cinematic meditation on fear, violence, and the meaning of safety, bringing viewers into intimate proximity with the people self-tasked with protecting the nation's children while generating revenue along the way, as well as with those most deeply impacted by these heightened security measures: students and teachers.","popularity":1.4009,"poster_path":"/gmgRgyY6NhPhsjbpBLypzRx9qiB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132478,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walking Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":85095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Lens","origin_country":"US"},{"id":71551,"logo_path":"/hT2G2iuXXqY458TYen2T2qmjlS8.png","name":"Field of Vision","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bulletproof","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899607,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Todd Chandler","original_name":"Todd Chandler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b7f6e1bfeb8b009a9a9110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Troy Herion","original_name":"Troy Herion","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/iPns60MJLo1YwgahNuswzZHZsWb.jpg","credit_id":"5e234bd28f26bc0011771ffc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danielle Varga","original_name":"Danielle Varga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e234b16397df000169bab47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169828,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emily Topper","original_name":"Emily Topper","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe0479b764841003d70bfec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11719000","wikidata_id":"Q111181506","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gmgRgyY6NhPhsjbpBLypzRx9qiB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eWF0T4mZCC848ZbI3MfyH2pwCJs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158671,"name":"public school"},{"id":159457,"name":"security"},{"id":163656,"name":"gun violence"},{"id":171676,"name":"school shooting"},{"id":186523,"name":"lockdown"},{"id":226424,"name":"gun control"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs Film Festival","release_date":"2020-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ Docs Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bulletproof | Official Trailer","key":"QBJBBc8PiFU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-10-06T13:32:31.000Z","id":"640ce490323eba00ef614a1e"}]}}}
