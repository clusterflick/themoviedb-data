In a characterization that is part dictator and part preacher, Hall, flanked by emblematic red banners, recites a litany of clich√©s: \"Mind your superiors... Obey the laws... Leave politics to the politicians...\" The monotonous repetition of these aphorisms imbues them with a sinister, Orwellian ambiguity. Through theatricality and spectacle, this work continues Hall's investigation of the manipulation of images and language as signs of power.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is the Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Hall","original_name":"Doug Hall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2287ccbfeb8b0013d03bc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
