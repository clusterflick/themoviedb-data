Revolving Door is one of a group of works that continue concerns found throughout Jacobs' oeuvre. The rotating landscapes of earlier works and performances, in which the projector is used as a tool to create dimensionality and movement within and between still frames, here give way to a playful comment on stillness, movement, and depth.","popularity":0.1276,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revolving Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"5e1ff3ecb3316b00110261b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
