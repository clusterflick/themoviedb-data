Highly stroboscopic and hallucinatory, these kinetic performances result in otherworldly spaces and plays of near-abstraction and suggestive imagery. Insistent Clamor features an evocative musical score. This recent work highlights Jacobs' relentless experimentation with the very fabric of projected light.","popularity":0.1135,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Insistent Clamor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"5e1feb5f0cd4460013c6ef31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
