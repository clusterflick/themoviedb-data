In addition to also singing like crap, Daniel describes his harrowing and slutty Covid-19 survival stories, rails against the foolish presidency and his disgustingly hideous children, sings songs about men that lie about their STDs, and about Breonna Taylor's murderers, who are still walking the streets. Hoe's Parade is a celebration of life where Daniel proudly makes world history as the first queer gay man to perform stand-up comedy live at the Rose Bowl!","popularity":0.2189,"poster_path":"/rODJNFuoNOdSMSnAMxbVJAPiCpt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniel Webb: Hoe's Parade Live at the Rose Bowl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Webb","original_name":"Daniel Webb","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/9dZIjce63Kvr4xOIKIzIXg9QQ9v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60d33a4a65e0a200450eaddf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Volk-Weiss","original_name":"Brian Volk-Weiss","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/hCIRphJgbdJhkVm5LCgj2qXOGk2.jpg","credit_id":"609a049905a533003b2abce9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Webb","original_name":"Daniel Webb","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/9dZIjce63Kvr4xOIKIzIXg9QQ9v.jpg","credit_id":"60d33a5a957e6d007316ac4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12752032","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/23BHVUkUvWgYs8nzYaDVBiAgvt6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.768,"height":1299,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/PjDYJ84ZHz5xIvuMit1H9oWxM3.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3596}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rODJNFuoNOdSMSnAMxbVJAPiCpt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i9NLxuKFTrCYZvLlUpemVhtwZRS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
