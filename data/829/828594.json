Are we really as mean, parochial and up for a fight as the movies often make us out to be? Sanjeev examines which Scottish stereotypes have a whiff of truth and which ones should be fed to the Loch Ness Monster. Packed with great film clips from both famous classics and lesser-known cult gems, the programme features contributions from an impressive supporting cast list, including actors Kate Dickie, Clare Grogan, Gary Lewis, Denis Lawson, Alex Norton and Tam Dean Burn.","popularity":0.1543,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wha's Like Us","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjeev Kohli","original_name":"Sanjeev Kohli","popularity":0.331,"profile_path":"/d89uNMFraJvyDxOBSXXuTxzlNDm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"665f06a8ae111d0b34e11a6e","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
