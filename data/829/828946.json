A similar bus is depicted in Veta. There are no specifics to the story. It is the creator's response to the horrors that have haunted the Balkans for the past ten years. The film does not offer an answer or take sides, it concentrates on the psychology of war and feeling of no exit.","popularity":0.1799,"poster_path":"/lPsb6PmSNn4KoMAZxsw1QwJO0Ex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53362,"logo_path":"/ch7zajY5zGs3R2txZqw56AKHtFg.png","name":"Sisters and Brother Mitevski","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2001-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biljana Dragičevikj Projkovska","original_name":"Biljana Dragičevikj Projkovska","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/AshScHq7lZLDxJcSOqO2gDC76A4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"609c33ccfd4a9600634d792e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vlado Jovanovski","original_name":"Vlado Jovanovski","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/jJmVeQ3kL9XWumrjrheZCd8WqPi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"609c33d4e272600040baab16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katerina Kocevska","original_name":"Katerina Kocevska","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/h8DH6837iLZ0zrgbCC8onYnK9z1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"609c33dcfd4a96003fe93d55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Labina Mitevska","original_name":"Labina Mitevska","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/wwZMlB4l0U2aeoE9zZendcCn3m6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"609c33ed7ecd2800790744a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petar Temelkovski","original_name":"Petar Temelkovski","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"609c33f5c51acd006dbef9c1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rubens Muratovski","original_name":"Rubens Muratovski","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"609c33fd2222f6002a000f94","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169422,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimir Samoilovski","original_name":"Vladimir Samoilovski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609c34565541fa0029d7dd26","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3088342,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maja Milanović","original_name":"Maja Milanović","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609c34264202280029b1a8c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769628,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kiril Spaseski","original_name":"Kiril Spaseski","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609c34fe2a210c00583ba88e","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132578,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Teona Strugar Mitevska","original_name":"Teona Strugar Mitevska","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/7Ipv7r2OQosa55Q1On29zWEKPPl.jpg","credit_id":"609c34324202280042a49d1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132578,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Teona Strugar Mitevska","original_name":"Teona Strugar Mitevska","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/7Ipv7r2OQosa55Q1On29zWEKPPl.jpg","credit_id":"609c3441ec45520058d642e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277423","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPsb6PmSNn4KoMAZxsw1QwJO0Ex.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
