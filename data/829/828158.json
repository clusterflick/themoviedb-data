If you don't have it, you need to get it. But that is the thing: Communists don't like to make money. At least that is what we thought. A film on the unbelievable ironies and counterintuitive measures taken during the Cold War. Threatened by bankruptcy the GDR lost its ideals and became a receptive student of capitalism in its most elaborate form. It is a story of tunnels underneath the Iron Curtain, of collaboration between East and West. In the end, the Cold War isn't what it seemed to be.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comrades & Cash: Geheime Geschäfte unter dem Eisernen Vorhang","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13399664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
