While there is no official information to be found about this DVD, the elaborate menu graphics and wildly varied original sound design point to this DVD as potentially a form of portfolio, allowing the artist to showcase their early work alongside original digital manipulations.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/pL7gSrGOYoT6ayAN82LklNTnEp4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhode Island School of Design","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belly's","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64dfbd55b77d4b11401a6e74","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"609a0581d6590b003e20dbb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":769,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2TnUNUPn17OHG6uBJf0PiMlFgTN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1368}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pL7gSrGOYoT6ayAN82LklNTnEp4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
