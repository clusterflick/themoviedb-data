The series of ethnographic films, Coding Culture, explores the cultures of outsourced work and the moulding of a new workforce to cater to this global high-tech services industry.  Each of the three films focuses on a single company, representing one of the major types of software company found in Bangalore: a medium-sized Indian-owned company software services company (Mphasis: The 'M' Way); the offshore software development centre of a U.S.-based IT company (Sun Microsystems: Fun@Sun); and a small 'cross-border' startup company that produces its own software products and markets them to global customers (July Systems: July Boys). All three companies are engaged in the production of software products or services for markets outside of India, but the nature of their work and their position in the global economy differ, producing significant variations in their cultures of work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coding Culture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gautam Sonti","original_name":"Gautam Sonti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ae727006eee003c1fcbe6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Upadhya","original_name":"Carol Upadhya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ae77038469a003f7182dc","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sahana Udupa","original_name":"Sahana Udupa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ae79a8e20c5003ea0994d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"A.
