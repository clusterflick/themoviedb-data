It explores the unanswered questions that arise in the face of tragedy and in the deaths of those who are far, far too young. It is a meditation on life, on death, and on purpose. The film imagines a final reckoning between Anne Frank (Aubrey Peeples) and God (Lorraine Toussaint). It is a reminder of the effect that just one person, even a young girl hidden away, can have on the world","popularity":0.3797,"poster_path":"/tORvuQiZwgm5UujiV7qFE0TAF1k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archer Back Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":154106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anne Frank Meets God Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anne Frank Meets God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Conversation: Anne Frank Meets God","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aubrey Shea","original_name":"Aubrey Shea","popularity":0.2555,"profile_path":"/jmTcBcrSXg9KcHCrg70VajgLOAk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anne Frank","credit_id":"609a5c98283ed9003c6fded1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Toussaint","original_name":"Lorraine Toussaint","popularity":0.8291,"profile_path":"/ali9XSMkZ0uAQLkmK0PoHXhJS0t.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"God (voice)","credit_id":"609a5cac2790bf003c23da23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1548160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Eisenman","original_name":"Robin Eisenman","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Edith Frank","credit_id":"609a5cc220af77003b8100d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brienne La Flair","original_name":"Brienne La Flair","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Margot Frank","credit_id":"609a5cd593db92003d18e615","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2741260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Win Meyerson","original_name":"Win Meyerson","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":"/xU5NCe14qRkxtVsNrQK10ZjX5x0.jpg","credit_id":"609a5c4538469a003c70819d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kylie Brown","original_name":"Kylie Brown","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/dNCRH145ZXcgI1r9ZnVoq6Hqw41.jpg","credit_id":"609a5d07ecc7e8003eba7fb6","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3086776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kimberly Jentzen","original_name":"Kimberly Jentzen","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/t6WRM61Ok1v3pNXE0jGJlH9xJE.jpg","credit_id":"609a5bef20af77003d8134f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3086776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kimberly Jentzen","original_name":"Kimberly Jentzen","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/t6WRM61Ok1v3pNXE0jGJlH9xJE.jpg","credit_id":"609a5bdb38469a003d70be83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3086780,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vanessa Aleman","original_name":"Vanessa Aleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a5c6420af77003d81353d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3157574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/epstvlTCF2P5gN0e1PK5C4K9QJX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1412}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tORvuQiZwgm5UujiV7qFE0TAF1k.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lIOC7Eo3KjeJ6U3XmiMNS9fN198.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Louisville's International Festival of Film","release_date":"2018-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ANNE FRANK MEETS GOD Trailer","key":"DC8Ez6bqWEk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-25T09:00:30.000Z","id":"609a5e9b90cf51003c18c72d"}]}}}
