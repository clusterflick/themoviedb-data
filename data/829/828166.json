But since the land is owned by the state, the local government actually has absolute control. The so-called democratically elected village chief quickly learns that his role is to cooperate with the government in using land to develop the economy. Power-to-money transactions are open secrets. Due to the uneven economic development in the villages, each has a different story, but the use of land for profit is a constant theme. The filming location is a rural village in the outside Beijing. Less of focus is how villages elect than the mutation after. Faced with huge land assets and overseeing relationships between land, power, economics, social systems, how does a hard-working, upright peasant conduct himself? This film documents the pain: the experience of soul sublimation and degeneration. We see 'birth defects' in this \"democracy\" — one without checks and balances, grafted onto autocracy.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electing a Village Chief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Jie","original_name":"胡杰","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/4u1S6V6xXBK2c2LkmE0DQTMnWl9.jpg","credit_id":"609961d68ee49c004074c692","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
