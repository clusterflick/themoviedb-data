The excerpt stayed with me for a while.  This prompted me to focus on Chantal’s sound work in her films and her very close collaboration with cellist, Sonia Wieder-Atherton with whom she made more than 20 films.  And, since New York, Paris and Moscow were places the three of us had in common, I intertwined some of my images with hers.","popularity":0.0499,"poster_path":"/ruieL50sjKjTQ8YfnEzQjmwiz2e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102965,"logo_path":null,"name":"On the Fly Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Son chant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"609bb5d028d7fe00403baf14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1676946,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sonia Wieder-Atherton","original_name":"Sonia Wieder-Atherton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"609bb5db67203d0058aeebd4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","original_name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6zUuRK9t2MoFK1XRtyu7pHqzD7L.jpg","credit_id":"609bb5ac2a210c00583b0e70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2015369,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ruti Gadish","original_name":"Ruti Gadish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609bb5ba67203d0078795a90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ruieL50sjKjTQ8YfnEzQjmwiz2e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"International Short Film Festival Oberhausen","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jecheon International Music & Film Festival","release_date":"2023-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SONia CHANTal - trailer","key":"Qk-b7RL7ysw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-24T10:21:44.000Z","id":"609bb661e272600029493ca7"}]}}}
