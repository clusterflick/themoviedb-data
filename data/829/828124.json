Осколки","overview":"The legendary cultural critic, author of books about M. Babanova, B. Brecht, A. Tarkovsky, Maya Turovskaya tells us a novel. Childhood, in people, my universities… She tells it like a writer. Only her novel is not written, but shot on camera and supplemented with photos and newsreel footage. In other words, it's a movie monologue about time. About a communal apartment in Maly Kozikhinsky Lane in Moscow. About my parents and my father's arrest. About kindergarten and school. About friends and girlfriends. About teachers. About the beginning of the war and the evacuation to Sverdlovsk. About her husband, critic Boris Medvedev, who met the war on the border, and ended it in Stalingrad. About parallel studies at Moscow State University and at GITIS. About the fight against rootless cosmopolitans.","popularity":0.1486,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":318,"logo_path":"/q0UG4oZERwIywJdDPF4lRlvdYGW.png","name":"CTB Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maya Turovskaya.
