The texts question art and experimental cinema, the role of the market in shaping aesthetic criteria, and current politics... In each of the texts, words common to the other language appear, creating an indeterminacy of the word to this or that speech. This indeterminacy is increased by the many word games created between the two languages. This results in a double reading: vertical and horizontal, favoured by the word for word. The exposure time of each word depends on the rhythmic of each language, but their appearance in white or black is not subject to it. Faced with these texts, two sounds intervene and otherwise disturb the concentration required by the projected texts. The horizontal reading of both speeches is often in clear contradiction with their meaning. This third visual discourse is playful, brittle, mocking the seriousness of the discourse(s).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l9NJGLs1olnWFwv6MV2JUSQ8djO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VO/ID","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Beauvais","original_name":"Yann Beauvais","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/jTAHhdTQziEGqydwy6537mNSPiw.jpg","credit_id":"609bea3e126ec300404e269b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l9NJGLs1olnWFwv6MV2JUSQ8djO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":655}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Scratch projection","release_date":"1986-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
