A witness to these dramatic events is a German mark banknote with a portrait of Clara Schumann. Passed from hand to hand, it is part of the war, emigration or illegal business. This depressing plasticine animation shows a grim wartime reality. The leitmotif of the wandering banknote allows the story to come full circle and leads to a slightly hopeful ending.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/z6BzRysC0X2oD6aZhrsplbNaM5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Molos","origin_country":"XK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"2021-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clara with a Mustache","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3088299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilir Blakçori","original_name":"Ilir Blakçori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609c1a88ec8a430058aa23bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411049,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Vala Blakçori","original_name":"Vala Blakçori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc0de6ae6f090043f2d8b2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3088299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilir Blakçori","original_name":"Ilir Blakçori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc0e74fe6c1800c20ae8f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2126735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Holly Sedillos","original_name":"Holly Sedillos","popularity":0.2167,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6712f24098f6a758cd54eea4","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14222204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2456,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z6BzRysC0X2oD6aZhrsplbNaM5H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1637}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Annecy International Animation Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
