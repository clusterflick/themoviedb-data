Velez's vision is intensely personal; avoiding overt editorializing or ethnographic analysis, he depicts the landscapes, gestures, textures and rhythms of their culture in powerful, evocative images. The political and internecine conflicts confronting the Mayans are conveyed through the sound of American news broadcasts. Through subtle video effects — rapid, almost liquid pans, magnified close-ups, and slow motion — Velez expresses their strength and dignity. His highly charged, slow-motion image of a Mayan woman, gazing with curiosity and suspicion at the camera, becomes an eloquent metaphor for a culture in transition.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/rqx8ZVsDeMMpl0tZ54oHdsYJ0M6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meta Mayan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Meta Mayan II","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edin Velez","original_name":"Edin Velez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604df8c74284ea00731b3b43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edin Velez","original_name":"Edin Velez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604df8e06517d60053417c08","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edin Velez","original_name":"Edin Velez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604df8d21d820f005299c692","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edin Velez","original_name":"Edin Velez","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604df8d92cefc20054f8e7ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rqx8ZVsDeMMpl0tZ54oHdsYJ0M6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
