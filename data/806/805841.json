In her private life, shy and plagued by an inferiority complex, the actress multiplied the unhappy marriages. At 19, she married a businessman to escape an incestuous father. In 1943, she married the brilliant Orson Welles, who gave her a daughter and a misunderstood role in \"The Lady of Shanghai\". Prince Ali Khan and the singer Dick Haymes followed.","popularity":0.4517,"poster_path":"/rp71eZ6kwLxH9PPTi9g45VsUuYS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bremedia Produktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1775,"logo_path":"/ilL857W1zhtnudzvdlxrjIqLAvs.png","name":"Radio Bremen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rita Hayworth - Zu viel vom Leben","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Rita Hayworth - Gloire et blessures","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Hayworth","original_name":"Rita Hayworth","popularity":0.6364,"profile_path":"/k92fu0gVAY98kFGXgIZmdquroFQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"61606e7e4df2910043852727","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Runge","original_name":"Katja Runge","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"640b8472899da200853e4072","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henning van Lil","original_name":"Henning van Lil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604e439589f749003c762d34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katja Runge","original_name":"Katja Runge","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604e43a3976a23007474d9d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14239356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzZjo3Yr1aygMYRhqzeiSN4n6tg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rp71eZ6kwLxH9PPTi9g45VsUuYS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162262,"name":"movie star"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2021-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2021-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
