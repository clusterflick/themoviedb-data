It mixes the documentary language with comedy and fiction, and is enriched by interviews to some of the most important voices of Turin cinematography. The film follows the evolution of movie theaters by enlightening its main milestones: the pre-cinema experiences in the late 19th Century, the colossals and the movie cathedrals of the silent era, the arthouse theaters, the National Museum of Cinema, the Torino Film Festival, the movie theaters system today and the main hypothesis about its future. The mission of Handbook of Movie Theaters' History is to explore and give back to the audience a deep reflection about the identity and the value of movie theater, in its social and anthropological role and as a mass media, and to analyze the experience of the viewer.","popularity":0.2612,"poster_path":"/jo5pe4TX1bPTcFmcRpFIIja3J0U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143423,"logo_path":"/gWf8udE3VNshhjvrdEmvRsh9nEI.png","name":"Fuoricampo
