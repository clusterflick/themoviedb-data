'After The Storm' takes us through the experiences of a settled Arab community of Iraqi, Palestinian and Yemeni children, writers, political activists and steelworkers. It examines how Arabs are attacked and despised in the media and how this is manipulated to sway public opinion in times of war.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/3fFUdgmxgOScXbVfP5EWVXplLdE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migrant Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3008907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venu Dhupa","original_name":"Venu Dhupa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"604cc9141d5386002814049e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Fero","original_name":"Ken Fero","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/5iqoGbxEPGa7WuDjNmOa25Dl9d7.jpg","credit_id":"604cc94422e4800028ac757d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fFUdgmxgOScXbVfP5EWVXplLdE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
