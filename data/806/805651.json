These weapons came fully into their own in World War II, and combined with the tactics of blitzkrieg, gave Germany early supremacy. Ground support aircraft such as Stuka dive-bombers were used to devastating effect. The Soviet response to this combination was the T-34 tank whose 76 or 85mm gun could fire high explosive shells as well as armor piercing rounds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s78UZa0D72DmEoZoYJHGBcp5GiK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Magic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encyclopedia Of Modern Armor: Engines Of War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s78UZa0D72DmEoZoYJHGBcp5GiK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
