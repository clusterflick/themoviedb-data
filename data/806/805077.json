The Unspeakable Speaking. Glossolalia among Natives, Christians, as an Emergency Language and Poetic Experiment, was the Pentecostal movement in America. The 45-minute video documentary, which was broadcast on Austrian television under the title The Unspeakable Speaking, used glossolalia to examine speech without apparent meaning. By examining speech defects, literary texts and the babbling of babies, forms of articulation for which normal linguistic logic plays no role were explored. The focus, which is beyond moral judgment, lies on various forms of expression and other, possible approaches and representations of reality.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":86011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pre TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1992-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unspeakable Speaking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oswald Wiener","original_name":"Oswald Wiener","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604b6991ec4552005903b88e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Wiener","original_name":"Ingrid Wiener","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604b699b8741c40070c9cb38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valie Export","original_name":"Valie Export","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tl9mnr8YhhvdIwRBKr7LohARBRH.jpg","credit_id":"604b69a21d78f20025aecf43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ORF / FS1 (Part of the art program \"Kunst-St√ºcke\")\t","release_date":"1992-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
