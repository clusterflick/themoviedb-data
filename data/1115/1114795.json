Equal parts personal and political, historical and imagined, May 35 rests on a cinematic score of aural ebbs and flows, and mixes Dahwenâ€™s own words spoken and displayed news-ticker style with text generated from image-recognition software over a visual examination of Tiananmen Square as an intersection of history, tourism, regulation, and surveillance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May 35","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Dahwen","original_name":"Roland Dahwen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643e6ddfe0ca7f0533070397","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
