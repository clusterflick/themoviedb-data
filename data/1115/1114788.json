This location provided a jumping-off point to interrogate histories of settler-colonialism, identity, and mythos in the surrounding landscape, from the viewpoint of a recent immigrant. These histories are related in fragmentary fashion by community members in a collage of voices, contrasting with monumental narratives set in stone. Throughout the film, history rubs against absurdity and elements of folk tradition. Fellow immigrants are rendered visible in everyday situations, protests are documented, a wizard invents an empire, vinyl is vandalized, and Anglo-Saxon re-enactors trek through the moors, gesturing towards waves of settlement on the island currently known as Great Britain","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come On Pilgrim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3336405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcy Saude","original_name":"Marcy Saude","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643e69b2d7a70a0314ab19d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Encounters Film Festival 2023","release_date":"2023-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
