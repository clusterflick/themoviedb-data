Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry (prototype Model 299/XB-17) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the Air Corps' performance specifications. Although Boeing lost the contract (to the Douglas B-18 Bolo) because the prototype crashed, the Air Corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances, becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time, behind the four-engined Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the multirole, twin-engined Junkers Ju 88.","popularity":0.1257,"poster_path":"/dzbZIW8lIFjginzv11itlz0JtpK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"B-17 Flying Fortress: The workhorse of the American mighty bomber force.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OiUqfEJWRbWRaQN4BvoQdifj8t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1171,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dzbZIW8lIFjginzv11itlz0JtpK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":781}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":277688,"name":"boeing"},{"id":339716,"name":"b-17 flying fortress"},{"id":339717,"name":"the united states army air corps"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
