His collection features classic films by Eisenstein and Godard as well as long-forgotten light entertainment, and shorts. He screened the films in the basement of his bungalow, which he had converted into a private cinema. The prints were housed in his garage, his shed and in a derelict building on a neighbouring plot of land. In 2009 Wolfgang Schneider moved into a care home and the house was sold. Due to its vast size, lack of proper classification and precarious condition, the film collection has yet to find a buyer. It has been moved on several occasions from one ill-equipped storage space to another.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Filmsammler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Krautkrämer","original_name":"Florian Krautkrämer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d445146aed4051c50500a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2476824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
