There are few runways here, so pilots take off and land on any semi flat surface they can find amid the towering mountain passes, rugged glaciers, gravel bars, mudflats, farms, lakes, streams, beaches or in small clearings hacked out of the wilderness.  The weather can change from clear and sunny to white out conditions in minutes, and pilots have to be aware of icing conditions and downdrafts from the sides of mountains.  The favored airplanes were designed and built over fifty years ago - still covered with fabric and equipped with balloon tires, skis, or floats.  The skill and knowledge required to fly in Alaska's bush country comes only after many hours in the air., flying in all kinds of conditions. Yet, the number of mishaps every year proves that flying in Alaska is a dangerous challenge, even to experienced pilots!","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/x8FmNqlmztu0SPV3EIPGdXjJSy5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migratory Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Travel into the world of the Alaskan Bush Pilot","title":"Bush Pilots of Alaska","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Claus","original_name":"Paul Claus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bush Pilot","credit_id":"643deefcd940350530fccfb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Claus","original_name":"John Claus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bush Pilot","credit_id":"643def1f0284200306f5f1b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwendolyn Frary","original_name":"Gwendolyn Frary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bush Pilot","credit_id":"643def43f706de053329a048","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffery Gustafson","original_name":"Jeffery Gustafson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bush Pilot","credit_id":"643def6bfba62503136abcf0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay M.
