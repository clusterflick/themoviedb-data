The remnants of the film found themselves in a digital scanning device instead of the garbage. The found pieces, which were transferred to digital media one by one, frame by frame, were brought together on the editing table. The fragile face of the analogue film, which emerged with time and storage conditions, was preserved and the faded film surface was colored. This found footage has been turned into a ‘post-production’ film and set on a new narration based on the appropriation. The daydream of a lonely person is turned into a movie, with the remaining frames put together. Each image tries to make you feel the timelessness of this dreamer.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Müge Yildiz","original_name":"Müge Yildiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d4e77d7a70a02eb171aae","department":"Lighting","job":"Directing Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4048086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muge Yildiz","original_name":"Muge Yildiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64567e136aa8e00139b9e496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
