It was a large church with an atrium and a large patio where the Franciscans summoned people and invited them to convert to the Catholic religion. In 1891 it was raised again, when the restoration work began, its original decorations were discovered and restorers tried not to leave a trace of Spanish influences. The total restoration was completed in 2005. This animation is my tribute to Uayma.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/4CSBKmzr4nnXNimsyalj4dYrC05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uayma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3099791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camila Garcia","original_name":"Camila Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d24ec46aed4051c503f61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4CSBKmzr4nnXNimsyalj4dYrC05.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
