His linguistic skills had not yet developed; however, he had a noticeable capacity for taking photos and videos. Over the course of several months, he composed a large collection of still and motion images. All of the content in green before “green” was captured by Atticus between the ages of 17 months and 3.5 years old. Upon reviewing the visuals, the notion of an “untutored eye” began to emerge. Within these photographs, it became evident that Atticus had not yet conformed to the accepted laws of perspective or logic. In short, he was immersed in an adventure of perception. Green before “green” explores the relationship between language and human vision. Prior to the acquisition of language, do humans have an affinity for optical perception? If so, at what point do linguistic concepts alter the boundaries of our visual freedom?","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"green before “green”","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Echeverria","original_name":"Paul Echeverria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d273f46aed4049e504338","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
