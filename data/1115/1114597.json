Camera in hand, over the duration of a year Richardson repeatedly walked this coastline. These walks – pilgrimages and acts of protest – structure a film that documents a singular and fragile landscape at an uncertain moment. Plans to expand the nuclear power station at Sizewell will have a lasting impact on the environment.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/fwmoVJJk6xLlV9DuHFeuwObZrcv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Immaterial Terrain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Richardson","original_name":"Emily Richardson","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/kmFmfhnB8XfBmz3ib6rxcMn2RLb.jpg","credit_id":"643dc0fa85c0a204fa29b44a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":1154,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fwmoVJJk6xLlV9DuHFeuwObZrcv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":874}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
