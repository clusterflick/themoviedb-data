But this ivory comes from mammoths, whose tusks, skeletons and sometimes frozen bodies are regularly found in the frozen ground of Siberia. According to estimates by some scientists, it could contain the remains of several million mammoths! eternal ice. Their goal: to discover the frozen remains of mammoths trapped in the permafrost. Using derisory means, they dig the frozen ground from which they extract bones, teeth, skulls... and above all, precious mammoth tusks. Ivory - the white gold of the tundra - will sell for over $50 a kilo. A total market appears at $2.5 million, with hubs in Moscow and Hong Kong.","popularity":0.2092,"poster_path":"/zlTUw4sn3JM134Kjkv4i6Kqnzmf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mammoth Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mammoth Hunter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Afanassieff","original_name":"Jean Afanassieff","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/8gltg04oEVpvxbr31kb92RFtnx3.jpg","credit_id":"643d59b74d679102ecd85caf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":70952,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Muriel Breton","original_name":"Muriel Breton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d59c34d679104f3d8639e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2944508,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pascal Torbey","original_name":"Pascal Torbey","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d59d08ec4ab049aafaacb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Afanassieff","original_name":"Jean Afanassieff","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/8gltg04oEVpvxbr31kb92RFtnx3.jpg","credit_id":"643d59de41ad8d119938395d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106651,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Dubrovsky","original_name":"Sergey Dubrovsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d5a4a46aed402eb50550f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2183168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/csS354O4L6zXaT2wUaAAyTS7phX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zlTUw4sn3JM134Kjkv4i6Kqnzmf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174638,"name":"siberia"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":299053,"name":"mammouths"},{"id":316190,"name":"traffic ivory"},{"id":316191,"name":"russia society"},{"id":316192,"name":"toundra"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
