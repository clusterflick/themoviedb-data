In fear of nuclear war, the group decided to stay and started a peace camp to protest against the storage of nuclear weapons at the base. The peace camp became women-only and soon transformed into a public space for women’s voices attracting hundreds of thousands of women over two decades.  Thalia, one of the original marchers and activists at the camp, shares the untold story of the longest feminist protest in British history and reflects on how collective action changed the lives of thousands of women inspiring several generations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gDc9UtMgMcBCdkxE4pNa706NqQ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matrioshka Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Together they amplified their power and made history","title":"Sew to Say","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastián Thomas","original_name":"Sebastián Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d30d646aed404c85046ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2783605,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"María Corral Benitez","original_name":"María Corral Benitez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d30ee46aed4051c50462c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rakel Aguirre","original_name":"Rakel Aguirre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d30142ea6b904ef520731","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastián Thomas","original_name":"Sebastián Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d3056d7a70a04f9171ad6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014771,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimena Martínez Sáez","original_name":"Jimena Martínez Sáez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d31164d67910521d84b1e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rakel Aguirre","original_name":"Rakel Aguirre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d302a41ad8d11c92ca977","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4014768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rakel Aguirre","original_name":"Rakel Aguirre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643d30388ec4ab04eeaf942a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gDc9UtMgMcBCdkxE4pNa706NqQ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
