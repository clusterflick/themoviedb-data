With day-in-the-life scenes on his fishing vessel, Njord, he emphasizes the critical need for ethical fishing practices, grassroots political organizing, and direct consumer relationships to thrive in an increasingly challenging economy. Featuring powerful moments from the 2001 battle to protect Seattle’s Fisherman’s Terminal for working vessels, this documentary not only showcases the fight for economic survival but also underscores the personal and collective resilience that sustains small family businesses in the face of adversity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A portrait of resilience, fisherman Pete Knutson navigates the turbulent waters of Alaska and the market.","title":"Loki Pete","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5482163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Knudson","original_name":"Pete Knudson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683fa3ecb30306f657f2bfe8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4996598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"B.J.
