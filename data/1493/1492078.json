The documentary follows two families affected by Russia's military aggression: the family of a Crimean activist who was abducted on the eve of the annexation of Crimea, and a mother from Lutsk whose two sons, volunteers in the Aidar Battalion, disappeared at the beginning of the armed conflict in Ukraine's East. Both stories reflect the fate of many Ukrainian families who have lost their homes, loved ones, and a sense of security since early 2014 when Crimea was annexed by Russia and the Donbas was disrupted by Russia-supported separatists and elements of the Russian Army.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7TLZOTgCpIHtfglvT4T3TCjtAfQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Limits of Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5480917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanislav Tsekhmistrenk","original_name":"Stanislav Tsekhmistrenk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683f04fab6c87dbf05fdbc85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7969154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7TLZOTgCpIHtfglvT4T3TCjtAfQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
