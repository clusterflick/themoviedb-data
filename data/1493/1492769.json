What Kafka wanted to express in a whole 50 page book, we here expressed in 30 seconds. The so called Gregor Samsa (Samsa is actually a playword-Kafka) lays himself to sleep, as he is supernaturally awoken, through pain and angst, as an insectoid. He can now only be engulfed by this horror and scream himself only to fall asleep yet again (forever).","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/a7qwS9ZCjR5JtbNTjTWXHCGFeAX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Expressionism in it`s purest form","title":"how gregor samsa became a bug (canonised)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gregor Samsa","credit_id":"6840b163e78ffadf8253b4f3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b18ee68027323b289bcf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b1aaf198ae2001f2c41b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b1b770e7b0c382f2c528","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b1c86d5809b1fb28a059","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b1d9ceb78bb86b7bb81a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b1e92cb7a94dcffcb6b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b20648f69b58cfad8f84","department":"Art","job":"Sculptor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Kelc","original_name":"Rene Kelc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b2142b13b19f6a28a12d","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7qwS9ZCjR5JtbNTjTWXHCGFeAX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253858,"name":"kafkaesque"},{"id":281363,"name":"franz kafka"},{"id":353168,"name":"gregor"},{"id":353169,"name":"samsa"},{"id":353170,"name":"gregor samsa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":["Stressful Scenes"],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Expressionism ","release_date":"2025-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"how gregor samsa became a bug (canonised)","key":"15livlCePvM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-04T19:54:08.000Z","id":"6840b36fe68027323b289bd8"}]}}}
