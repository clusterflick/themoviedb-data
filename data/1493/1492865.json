Set against some of the most consequential stories of our time—from the war in Gaza to the global climate catastrophe—the film follows the intrepid independent journalist Amy Goodman over 30 years. As she becomes a leader in the movement for independent media that amplifies voices excluded from the mainstream, she faces off against forces trying to silence her.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rLwZKfj0gIRzy514aMwv1lgUO2W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
