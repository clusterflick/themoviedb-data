These were discovered and then mysteriously disappeared from an east end Montreal egg distribution warehouse, once owned and operated by members of her family. The story of the windows gradually reveals the broader stories of Shtull’s Polish ancestors, and of the Jewish immigrant experience in this neighbourhood, known as the ‘Plateau’, which for many decades formed the centre of Montreal's Jewish community and culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ikM4DaDOmD9IgVOOc94MRp1EMQM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Windows on Rue Saint-Dominique","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikM4DaDOmD9IgVOOc94MRp1EMQM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
