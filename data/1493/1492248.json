We see an empty classroom with only one person in it, the class is actually filled with students but in our character’s head they disappear, focusing only on the silence and controlled breathing that could lead to a panic attack at any given moment. People struggle daily with anxiety and depression, it’s not easy to see at first sight but it’s real. This shortage wants to raise awareness about how anxiety can feel in different people. We don’t mean in any way to mock or undermine this feeling, we just want more people to be aware of the troubles it causes in some people’s minds. Anxiety can come in any form, silence, exaggeration, anger, sadness… everyone experiences it differently but all have one thing in common, they need help. If you or someone you know struggles with anxiety, don’t hesitate to ask for help, there’s nothing wrong in doing what’s right.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/43rCgyaews4GUYEnBIpKCPnReBJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":200,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anxiety Short Film","title":"Anxiety","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5481577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanesa Indzhova","original_name":"Vanesa Indzhova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1sAl2ywPhoQtAdWXmLHmnBFw5Hg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683f4e7675f11744d1fdbd31","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5481577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanesa Indzhova","original_name":"Vanesa Indzhova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1sAl2ywPhoQtAdWXmLHmnBFw5Hg.jpg","credit_id":"683f4eadaa854ccd4a538b4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5481577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanesa Indzhova","original_name":"Vanesa Indzhova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1sAl2ywPhoQtAdWXmLHmnBFw5Hg.jpg","credit_id":"683f4f0b419947f017538d6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5481581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carol Mejía Narvaez","original_name":"Carol Mejía Narvaez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683f4f5b1c6baae1417f4b60","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5481581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carol Mejía Narvaez","original_name":"Carol Mejía Narvaez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683f4f90682df7fa3268a5a3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5481577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanesa Indzhova","original_name":"Vanesa Indzhova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1sAl2ywPhoQtAdWXmLHmnBFw5Hg.jpg","credit_id":"683f4fa3a631056f23fdbd8a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/43rCgyaews4GUYEnBIpKCPnReBJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
