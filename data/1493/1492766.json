His thoughts are interrupted by a strange young man who asks, “How do I get to heaven?” What follows is an absurd, at times comical and unsettling dialogue filled with mistrust and irony.  The watchman, bound by routine, faces something beyond logic. The young man, without a ticket but full of conviction, insists heaven awaits him.  In the quiet, mysterious ending, the young man vanishes, leaving only a white feather — and a question: what was that?  A short animated parable about boundaries, misunderstanding, and the mystery of crossing worlds, with absurdist humor in the spirit of Kharms or Kafka.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/faID94JNdYHbxbIIVdqXriq0JJT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":264323,"logo_path":null,"name":"URI Animation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Absurdity is closer than it seems.","title":"The Surprised Watchman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Удививший сторожа","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"השומר המופתע","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3951996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Avdeev","original_name":"Maxim Avdeev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pTMnzt4sydoQ6aweIaqyCbFheEs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Watchman","credit_id":"6840cc2a2b13b19f6a28a18f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3951996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Avdeev","original_name":"Maxim Avdeev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pTMnzt4sydoQ6aweIaqyCbFheEs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Young Man","credit_id":"6840cd647f95d35c317bc4a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Reichel","original_name":"Michael Reichel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b173f0064156c2ad8ff3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1712058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniil Kharms","original_name":"Даниил Хармс","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/9CXJ3ayHO5bhuxf25YdOvbc18Re.jpg","credit_id":"6840cc7e8897a4a35de05af2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5483799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Reichel","original_name":"Michael Reichel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840cc9fc8fa40b281f2c5c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Gomon","original_name":"Anna Gomon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840ccb912beb1d6bcf2c4e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/faID94JNdYHbxbIIVdqXriq0JJT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":353164,"name":"israel animation"},{"id":353165,"name":"the surprised watchman"},{"id":353166,"name":"michael reichel"},{"id":353167,"name":"dudov"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
