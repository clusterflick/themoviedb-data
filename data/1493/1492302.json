At the core of the story, this film is about the unspoken trauma and miscommunication that lies beneath the surface, which is what makes it so universal. Everyone, no matter sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, creed, etc., has gone through some sort of trauma that sticks with us, influencing our decisions and choices in friends and partners, but also inevitably creeps its way into influencing our everyday relationships.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"HANDS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5481775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bloch","original_name":"Jon Bloch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683f654e89688b6603fdbe74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
