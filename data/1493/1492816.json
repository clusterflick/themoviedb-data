[No. 1]","overview":"Three sequences of TR addressing groups from the porch at Sagamore Hill. First sequence is TR speaking to a group of people on Sept. 8, 1917 at the opening of the second New York State suffrage campaign at Sagamore Hill. Second sequence is probably TR encouraging New York District volunteer workers for the third Liberty Loan on Apr. 2, 1918. Final views of TR addressing the large crowd which came to demonstrate support for him for the 1916 Presidential nomination. The May 27, 1916 rally was organized by members of the Roosevelt Non-Partisan League. Interior titles, which appear to be TR quotations, stress the need for loyal American citizens and for judicious American dealings with other nations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TR speaking at Sagamore Hill [1916-1918].
