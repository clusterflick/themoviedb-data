The idea of the film was this, to try for the first time to have a follow-up conversation with my father, to see where it would lead us both, to talk about things we had never talked about (that was the easiest since we had never talked about anything) and to film it, no matter what. I didn't know how it would end for him and me, I just knew that I was going to ask him at some point why he didn't like me and I would listen to his answer well. I thought I had come to make a movie about my father and I made a movie about him and me.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Fils de Jean-Claude Videau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Videau","original_name":"Frédéric Videau","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6841027c89688b6603fdc4e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0288007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
