Most of the boys wear caps and most of the girls wear fancy hats and ankle-length or mid-calf length full skirts; many of the students carry books. Two men attired in robes appear. Possibly a scene of graduation day or the last day of school.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of school day at coeducational school","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Graduation day in a coeducational school","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
