Is a blank page ever really empty? Where does an artwork begin or end? Are you the one directing creative flow or is it leading you? One may feel a creative impulse, but confronting daunting emptiness as a point of departure is inevitable. The only thing left to do is to make the first step, first dot, line or movement and suddenly the page transforms into something completely else and the multitudes it contains take up life on its own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11703,"logo_path":null,"name":"KASK","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2025-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wandering Dot and the Blank Square Page Universe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5484072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Lība Ratniece","original_name":"Ieva Lība Ratniece","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840e7b4053619a7adfdc3b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Riga International Short Film Festival 2ANNAS","release_date":"2025-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
