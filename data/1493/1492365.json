Spiritism, spontaneous combustion, love, mutated chickens, animated credits, copyright and image violations, as well as a skillful use of cinematic language characterize this, which is the best documentary ever made. A critical and public success, it has been banned in over 153 countries.  This documentary produced in 2011 perfectly closes this lineup of Gurcius Gewdner's early films, serving as almost a revisiting reflection of a passionate and cynical filmmaker who saw special interest in fake documentaries as a chance to produce films with zero budget, always with the kuchar brothers in his heart.  It is also a vote of hope for the emergence of new directors, touched by the spark of creation when watching these films by Gurcius Gewdner in the early 2000s.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/d1pYMQgzvFC7qnVj8mRzFV2voId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-24","revenue":50000,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The cutest and most perfect brazilian mockumentary about Gurcius Gewdner","title":"The Life and Death of Reincarnation by Gurcius Gewdner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sexual Reincarnation of a Hamster","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3770888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judas Vanir","original_name":"Judas Vanir","popularity":0.1255,"profile_path":"/geiP6PttoCLltTFFRqRI8f3RjzP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gurcius Gewdner","credit_id":"683fa58435f8e52018538ce0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.2412,"profile_path":"/37QgccRcCEydaYWkaN8KqPWnDJj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"683fa5e60b8cc35aca7f4d2d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5482185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Macagi","original_name":"Carlos Macagi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683fa5c8ed5954738df2be7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.2412,"profile_path":"/37QgccRcCEydaYWkaN8KqPWnDJj.jpg","credit_id":"683fa637aa854ccd4a538c27","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3086298,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruno Bello","original_name":"Bruno Bello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683fa7c7835f7f29bef2c014","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5482217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Ito","original_name":"Victor Ito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683fa7f07335d1f780ad89bc","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5482185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Macagi","original_name":"Carlos Macagi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683fa80c2ab005893aad8974","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4698472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d1pYMQgzvFC7qnVj8mRzFV2voId.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
