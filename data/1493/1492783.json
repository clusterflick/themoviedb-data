Gillian imposes strict rules, including locking away all sharp objects, to keep Ava safe. When Ava finds their late mother’s sewing things in the basement, she becomes obsessed with making a dress. Gillian, exhausted from juggling a corporate job and caregiving, tries to focus Ava’s attention on healing instead of hobbies – but her efforts to control Ava only deepen the rift between them.  As Ava’s dress takes shape, so does her sense of autonomy, challenging Gillian’s idea of what recovery should look like. The tension escalates when an argument over therapy turns physical, leading to a moment of violence neither sister intended. But in the aftermath, the sisters begin to glimpse a different way forward – messy, uncertain, and stitched with care.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iMPblVA8H5bE4a25rUFFPFw8uGQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Stitches","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wrenn Schmidt","original_name":"Wrenn Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6840b5958cc7f133477f5075","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1649418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katy Wright-Mead","original_name":"Katy Wright-Mead","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/ylw2LdnhkfMXMDOaZZ4Mg97DfQ3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6840b59e50cc47616d7f51d6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Frings","original_name":"Victoria Frings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b519e1842d6cf4fdc3ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victoria Frings","original_name":"Victoria Frings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b51f1774b7baa7fcb4b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5046071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Frings","original_name":"Victoria Frings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b528e1842d6cf4fdc3f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483828,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Randall Hunt","original_name":"Sarah Randall Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b5355e80d04ceb289df0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2896084,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sarah Whelden","original_name":"Sarah Whelden","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b53f0aa8d8b170fcb588","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467757,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raul Toledo","original_name":"Raul Toledo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b54b48f69b58cfad8f93","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483829,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Bongiorno","original_name":"Sam Bongiorno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b554419947f01753929b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604555,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kelly Wilcox","original_name":"Kelly Wilcox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b560b7b45a021a68af96","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dabney Morris","original_name":"Dabney Morris","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b5703ac908d6b5fdc503","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2981939,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Garrett Peters","original_name":"Garrett Peters","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6840b57ee1842d6cf4fdc3f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kog5gHMrGPxDQJaGrmTqVS78bF5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iMPblVA8H5bE4a25rUFFPFw8uGQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"deadCenter Film Festival","release_date":"2025-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
