Lockwood at the Emmanuel Church in Boston, Massachusetts. Side view of TR entering an automobile with two women, the one following TR may be his wife Edith; TR doffs his hat as he faces camera; view of crowd outside the Emmanuel Church; and long shot of woman holding blanket up, perhaps to shield the bride's entrance into the church. Last two segments appear to be unrelated scenes: medium close shot of TR sitting in a car with an unidentified man and a close up of TR with a man in uniform, both scenes are outside in undetermined locations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TR attends his son Archie's wedding at Boston, 1917","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Theodore Roosevelt attends his son Archie's wedding at Boston, 1917","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Roosevelt","original_name":"Theodore Roosevelt","popularity":0.2447,"profile_path":"/odVu3ybFf48lplnju3YNmuosOKi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6840bba1a631056f23fdc365","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archibald Roosevelt","original_name":"Archibald Roosevelt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6840bbb6d764063f52ad8dcf","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
