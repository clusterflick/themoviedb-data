His fixation on glory holes in particular leads him to Ari, an unconventional therapist, who guides Benji on a psychedelic journey through his own queer consciousness via the glory hole in his mind. Benji navigates shame, fear, piles of hot dogs, and a series of queer supervillains, on the road to understanding himself and his sexuality outside the context of his relationship with Sam.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"G L O R Y","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5483481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Kim","original_name":"Kai Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684081fc5e80d04ceb289d6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
