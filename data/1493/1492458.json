Living aboard a small boat in a working-class maritime community on the edge of Marin county, she uses personal video journals and home movies to revisit moments of motherhood, loss, and longing, while confronting the uncertainty of life on the water. Her story intersects with the lives of three people living anchored out on the San Francisco Bay – the wise, self-described “anchor outlaw” battling health issues while struggling to maintain his boat; the young advocate fighting to save her community from displacement; and the artist whose untimely death underscores the fragility of their existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for my Anchor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33382661","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
