Marked by the experience of his grandmother suffering from an illness that affects memory and perception of reality, the author decided to explore the thin line between reality and illusion. How can a retirement home and virtual reality be related? Can a director also be a prince? Aren’t our memories just an illusion? An immersive film miniature not only encourages contemplation on the uncertain nature of reality, but also invites to an intimate emotional experience using nostalgic home video as well.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90845,"logo_path":null,"name":"FTF VŠMU","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2024-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sea to Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radek Ševčík","original_name":"Radek Ševčík","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683f551c14531dc83828988f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
