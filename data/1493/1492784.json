The occasion is probably \"Remembrance Day,\" Aug. 4, 1918, the fourth anniversary of World War I. The Royal family, joined by the two Houses of Parliament and representatives of the overseas dominions and of the U.S., attend a special service of remembrance and rededication. Queen Alexandra and the Duke of Connaught follow Queen Mary and King George; Princess Mary, wearing a white collar, and Princess Victoria follow.
