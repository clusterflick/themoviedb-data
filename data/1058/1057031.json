The premiere took place on September 1 1913.  The showing of the film in Austria was banned because the film was likely to offend religious sensibilities. On April 20, 1921, following a complaint from the producer Báron, this decision was overturned by the film inspection authority with the restriction that the film “may not be shown in front of young people”.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/77v5ni4pVVJSo2sFw1qcMPT2D1G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rubin Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1913-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wittenberg Nightingale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Weg zur Sonne","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Martin Luther","type":"subtitle"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Essek","original_name":"Rudolf Essek","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/788kHE56Ki9kR5u5irmsHWmfczN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Martin Luther","credit_id":"638ca897ab5e3400af7b3b32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1339088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Zilzer","original_name":"Max Zilzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Erasmus von Rotterdam","credit_id":"638ca9321283e90097670fe0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot von Hardt","original_name":"Margot von Hardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Katharina von Bora","credit_id":"638ca8bc15376c3daaf9302d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Wehlau","original_name":"Ernst Wehlau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Philipp Melanchthon","credit_id":"638ca8dc7d5db50fdd1263b8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2458304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Alten","original_name":"Fritz Alten","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lukas Cranach","credit_id":"638ca8f71283e90097670fcd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3815013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Morvay","original_name":"Jacques Morvay","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kardinal Cajetan","credit_id":"638ca9180e64af00adaafa02","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Lindegg","original_name":"Hans Lindegg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Hans Luther","credit_id":"638ca967ab5e3400cf5fe4c5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Baron","original_name":"Erwin Baron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Wanderer","credit_id":"638ca99d0e64af00deab5603","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Baron","original_name":"Erwin Baron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638ca863c3aa3f0096e27f58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Baron","original_name":"Erwin Baron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638ca8588d77c40083edb782","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Willi Morée","original_name":"Willi Morée","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638caa2eab5e340096e58e58","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Baron","original_name":"Erwin Baron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638ca9d2c3aa3f007a114f39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7557126","wikidata_id":"Q1217596","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77v5ni4pVVJSo2sFw1qcMPT2D1G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1913-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
