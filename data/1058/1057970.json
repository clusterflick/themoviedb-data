It shows scenes of destruction, collapse, escape and drowning.The theme of this film « catastrophe » is a pretext to manipulate specific kinds of images and sounds. I played around with 3D softwares without any knowhow of the softwares in beforehand. The same way a kid would break some objects that he had patiently built, I tried to induce bugs, errors and accidents into the scenes and situations that I have drawn. The sequences of images generated by computer were then printed one by one, and reprinted, distorted and destroyed with an old photocopy machine. It is a question of transforming a clean and perfect imagery to an aesthetic of dirtyness, roughness and unpredactibility.The music was produced with a similar approach, while screening the film on an old cathodic television and capturing light signals from it. Those signals were then transformed randomly through a modular synthesiser.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5jiHv7rjznNuzP0gW7Sjl289SYH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Village Noyé","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damien Tran","original_name":"Damien Tran","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f366a19675702b5881676","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jiHv7rjznNuzP0gW7Sjl289SYH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
