Narrated by actor-activist Peter Coyote, Aimee Madsen’s documentary takes a close look at Soleri’s origins and lifelong labor of love– the futuristic city of Arcosanti which Soleri sets in the unforgiving desert outside Phoenix, Arizona. Inspiring a near cult-like following rivaled only by the passionate devotees of the architectural giant Frank Lloyd Wright, Soleri’s city continues to grow piece-by-piece long after the death of its creator. Soleri is the most interesting architect you’ve never heard of.","popularity":0.2556,"poster_path":"/idjuulHKm5AMdrbVrBf4dek6De7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eye Am Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paolo Soleri: Beyond Form","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2050124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Soleri","original_name":"Paolo Soleri","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"638f29c2ba131b00aeb8adc1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Coyote","original_name":"Peter Coyote","popularity":1.5648,"profile_path":"/ld3xLYTcZWjAc0bE33DONT7n9o8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"638f29e5fb834600846d13c0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aimee Madsen","original_name":"Aimee Madsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2b055800c400a5dc80d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817890,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Belinda Rukschcio","original_name":"Belinda Rukschcio","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2ab5ca0e1700871aba30","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roger Tomalty","original_name":"Roger Tomalty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2ac7196757026ca51ca9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817895,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Zahm","original_name":"Olivier Zahm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2b30fb834600846d14d4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aimee Madsen","original_name":"Aimee Madsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2a3fba131b00aeb8ae5a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817889,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Blake","original_name":"Peter Blake","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2a98fb834600e2e4e0ba","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aimee Madsen","original_name":"Aimee Madsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2a2519675702b5880b64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aimee Madsen","original_name":"Aimee Madsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2a47ba131b00aeb8ae64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817893,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeffrey Cook","original_name":"Jeffrey Cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f2ae8fb834600846d1492","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3291736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/idjuulHKm5AMdrbVrBf4dek6De7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
