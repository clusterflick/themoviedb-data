This short film is by far the biggest task I have undertaken and also marks my directorial debut. Something I hope will lead to many more such creations. Around 1 and a half years back I realised that just painting cool concepts was not going to be enough to satisfy my creative ambitions and so I started working on an idea to create my debut short film. This film would draw a lot of inspiration from the ideas I had as a student of architecture. Back then these ideas were still raw and lacked a clear focus and vision but those ideas served as a great starting point for me to develop this film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Existence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siddhartha Valluri","original_name":"Siddhartha Valluri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639139a1d5569700ae19db5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15271782","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
