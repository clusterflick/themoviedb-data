A documentary observation of a memorial nowadays, where children and adults come in groups and watch individually, with interest or get bored, emotionally react or indifferently distance themselves, sunk into phones, disconnected from the outside world… Film will tell about our time no less than Reninger’s notes about what happened in this place almost 80 years ago.","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/mdBzaXtpmuhSOCQwJqcfqDUq80M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studija Centrums","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nr. 105555","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaspars Znotiņš","original_name":"Kaspars Znotiņš","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/qo2O8Wspc6xJzzhI93JhIRitRvs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"638e2a88e942ee00a6ce5222","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2879473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruno Aščuks","original_name":"Bruno Aščuks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e2a14d75bd6008efcb500","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816603,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paula Zariņa","original_name":"Paula Zariņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e2a739ae6130083d05bf6","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"638e2a05d75bd6008efcb4fa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"638e27c66f97460098072b7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","original_name":"Andrejs Verhoustinskis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lO5h9sKfSwnzQ4V4FdVhBqZr7aF.jpg","credit_id":"638e29fad75bd600de0330d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2231045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Pāss","original_name":"Pēteris Pāss","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e053ec8741c400c7f2ad88","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mdBzaXtpmuhSOCQwJqcfqDUq80M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1360}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Splendid Palace (Lielais Kristaps opening screening)","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
