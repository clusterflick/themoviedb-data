The 1920's saw bold innovations in aeronautics.  The Italians perfected their semi-rigid airships, exploring the Artic.  The British sought to build an \"Empire in the Air,\" by starting their own fleet.  The Germans rose from the ashes of World War I with the most successful airship ever built: the LZ-127, Graf Zepplin.  The Americans began by trying to purchase airships overseas.  Two proved disastrous.  Building a new industry, the US Navy built a copy of a Zepplin and christened her, USS Shenandoah, the ZR-1.  This documentary covers the history of US airships.","popularity":0.594,"poster_path":"/lLsyGhoVoBzzXALzCnAaCBb77Li.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Airship History Series","title":"The American Zepplins","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2199,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lLsyGhoVoBzzXALzCnAaCBb77Li.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1470}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3520,"name":"zeppelin"},{"id":10400,"name":"airship"},{"id":221083,"name":"dirigible"},{"id":282914,"name":"blimp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
