Because what is it really like to make a living being a comedian and give yourself up - when deep down you are anxious by nature?  In the solo performance \"Det går betre no\" Bjarte shows a new side of himself, and tells personal stories from his outer daily life, and his inner life. As a priest's son with wavering faith in God, the hope is that angels will come to save him when life is at its darkest. Angels with wings, or just with a white coat.","popularity":0.1116,"poster_path":"/aW77xUIPr5BTxGmpTUg6T18DQKe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88033,"logo_path":"/hykhw4mOy3el6JfEkGf4dJu7eVV.png","name":"Feelgood Scene Film og TV","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Going Better Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bjarte Tjøstheim","original_name":"Bjarte Tjøstheim","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/aeTVcUcfUxCa8m0UufOZSWy7XJC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"638daba08d77c400989abf03","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3701264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Magnus Monn-Iversen","original_name":"Magnus Monn-Iversen","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638dabd57d5db50fdd12c4d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816043,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mia Runningen","original_name":"Mia Runningen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638dabef8d77c400989abf49","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bjarte Tjøstheim","original_name":"Bjarte Tjøstheim","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/aeTVcUcfUxCa8m0UufOZSWy7XJC.jpg","credit_id":"638dadb27d5db50fbf01572f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Giertsen","original_name":"Thomas Giertsen","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":"/xFDZ4jsytlyISVgWFIFAJ7m4lq2.jpg","credit_id":"638dabbf8d77c40086b19843","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3816042,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanne Hjertø Johansen","original_name":"Hanne Hjertø Johansen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638dabe5c3aa3f0096e2e1bf","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23019124","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lRnERxhyyWbPEM8xag21eFrk42b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aW77xUIPr5BTxGmpTUg6T18DQKe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"Digital release on Streamy.no","release_date":"2022-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Det går betre no - Det Norske Teatret","key":"X1EDSQmvlkg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-12T09:29:29.000Z","id":"638dac4e1283e9007c750651"}]}}}
