The last information on Lisa is that she's been photographing football stadiums in seven different villages all over Georgia. Her dad Irakli decides to search for her and travels to those places. Levani, Lisa's best friend and an invisible person, sets off to help. As the scenery changes from one football stadium to another, people change and people's stories change. Tensions build up on those simple and sometimes fun adventures as every football pit and every village travelled leaves less of a chance to find Lisa at all.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":167753,"logo_path":"/5RdurkEcl6gIKPOlDhI4avEL5Df.png","name":"New Matter Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Dry Leaf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Koberidze","original_name":"Alexandre Koberidze","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/kvBSVC6npxStKTtosXTJTRl7P0J.jpg","credit_id":"638f032604733f0085d0508a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Koberidze","original_name":"Alexandre Koberidze","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/kvBSVC6npxStKTtosXTJTRl7P0J.jpg","credit_id":"638f0330ca0e170080477ad6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Koberidze","original_name":"Alexandre Koberidze","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/kvBSVC6npxStKTtosXTJTRl7P0J.jpg","credit_id":"638f0356196757026ca4f3ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Koberidze","original_name":"Alexandre Koberidze","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/kvBSVC6npxStKTtosXTJTRl7P0J.jpg","credit_id":"638f0360ca0e17007bc7d6eb","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3028770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariam Shatberashvili","original_name":"Mariam Shatberashvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f0372ca0e1700871a93d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180076,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luise Hauschild","original_name":"Luise Hauschild","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f03875800c400d9989716","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186109,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giorgi Koberidze","original_name":"Giorgi Koberidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f03a0ba131b0085b43d6e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186109,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giorgi Koberidze","original_name":"Giorgi Koberidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638f03ac5800c4008bb4da40","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
