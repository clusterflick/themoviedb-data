During the games, we asked strangers their opinions on their communities, their homes, and the nation in general, in the context of recent political polarization and the effects of isolation following COVID-19. The road-trip documentary follows this journey, meeting the various people who volunteered to play a game, the different ways people and communities have adapted, their hopes, their fears, and finally, “what it means to be an American”.","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grand Trans-American Cornhole Quest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
