Amazingly, filmed over just three hours by a crew of three, the short depicts the opening of Post-Human, drawing back the curtain on the Post-Human world and letting viewers see the world and characters they've only been able to imagine previously. You'll get a taste of a world where everyone is immortal, have onboard mental \"mind's eye\" computers, nanotechnology can make your every dream a reality, and thanks to the magnetic targeted fusion implants every post-human has, everyone can fly (and yep, there's flying in this short!) But there's a dark side to this brave new world, including the fact that every post-human is monitored from the inside out, and the one artificial superintelligence running the show might be about to make its first big mistake.","popularity":0.1016,"poster_path":"/fVveP90wex2PhmQg5XQTmPeeHdo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Post-Human","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madison Smith","original_name":"Madison Smith","popularity":0.6905,"profile_path":"/tQDSReMuE0zhhDP4e3SvXcnCNmK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"James Keats","credit_id":"65d50e79db154f0164a018ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1522344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridget Graham","original_name":"Bridget Graham","popularity":0.4492,"profile_path":"/f8ltCEoD5oznoGfFTyeFQzfVmgZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Katherine Keats","credit_id":"65d50e8c0e4fc8016383f07e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Simpson","original_name":"David Simpson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6391349f7d550401054bdd08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6777600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fVveP90wex2PhmQg5XQTmPeeHdo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Post-Human Trailer (Recut, Darker, Louder, Better)","key":"DJhrfjSdt28","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-06T15:38:43.000Z","id":"65d50e2b5ca704017c0c7e8c"}]}}}
