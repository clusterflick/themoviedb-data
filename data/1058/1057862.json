A suspension of thought.Its inspired by the disappearance of Mariam Makhniashvili who disappeared in Toronto but was found dead two years after.\r It’s about remembrance, the power of a suspended thought. When a loved one disappears or someone vanishes for no reason, no trace, no answer, no closure, our thoughts enter a very specific state of mind. A state that is not clearly defined. The weight, our imagination, our love, our hope become a suspension, a powerful and emotional state. This suspension becomes an Intermission.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intermission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Guillen","original_name":"Mikel Guillen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638ef1391967570242d63aca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
