It was inspired by the need to be and appear “successful” and effective. The idea that the oppressed have to be overcome as an objective and their struggles and over pass the oppressor, in this case, the man. In many cases this objective has made them ultra superior beings that not only surpass the man but also have created a new breed of beings.\r The psychological state can be mixed with issues of repression and how architecture, spaces, structures and lighting can contribute to create specific worlds. A dialogue between Ayn Rand’s objectivism and Fassbinder’s Martha to give an example.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Deserve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Guillen","original_name":"Mikel Guillen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638ef1fb196757026ca4e8ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
