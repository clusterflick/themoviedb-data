Protestan female ministers who wish to serve God, the Church and people as pastors in today’s Latvia can only do that under the wing of foreign churches. Latvia is the only country in the world whose official Lutheran church has banned ordination of women after successfully practicing it for two decades. While some of the women ministers, refusing to accept this, leave the country to build lives as fully-fledged pastors elsewhere in the world, others carry on serving as second-rate assistants or other church workers. However, today there are female theologians who are ready to fight for a future in more equal society thus ending the discrimination based on ‘other sex’ or ‘wrong’ gender. The road towards changes leads through frustrations, confidence and doubts, obedience and rebellion.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/pXNjuQ8McQaxb6Pq2P7dUnLdurH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baltic Balkan Productions","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":146135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rucka Art Foundation","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristine Briede","original_name":"Kristine Briede","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638e2477b09bde00c11bf5e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3800147,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artis Lūsis","original_name":"Artis Lūsis","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e056859974ee0b6b765f50","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2909200,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ieva Ūbele","original_name":"Ieva Ūbele","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e056c58741c40099b4efc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2904982,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Šēnbergs","original_name":"Jānis Šēnbergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e056498741c400c7f2af9a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907855,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sniedze Prauliņa","original_name":"Sniedze Prauliņa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e05665373ac2007f02089f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristine Briede","original_name":"Kristine Briede","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e056233a48c5008fa9ff60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799243,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andris Grants","original_name":"Andris Grants","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e056a09974ee0b63f2fdc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antra Gaile","original_name":"Antra Gaile","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e056e03a48c5008100450b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2553500,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rihards Zaļupe","original_name":"Rihards Zaļupe","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/j9UIeJuP37VFRQxVWpdAnbZNPLn.jpg","credit_id":"67a693a8571d707f14c8941d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23546384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pXNjuQ8McQaxb6Pq2P7dUnLdurH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Splendid Palace (Lielais Kristaps opening screening)","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
