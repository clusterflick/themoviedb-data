The homeowner attacks, but the gophers outsmart him at every turn: They duck his hoe and shotgun. He gasses them with helium, and they float away -- causing a crow to throw away his bottle. The inflated gophers hit a tree and fall to earth. The gardener fishes for the gophers under his hat; they substitute a tomato, and he cries, thinking he's squished a gopher. Next, he tries the garden hose; the gophers stop the flow until there's a huge blast of water, which they direct back at the homeowner. He hits the ground and starts burrowing himself, surfacing in his fountain.","popularity":0.2799,"poster_path":"/liOSZKXokXTREXJJgii4bJHbYsn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gopher Goofy","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gophers, Farmer (uncredited)","credit_id":"635f8bed1b729400831394de","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173626,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norm McCabe","original_name":"Norm McCabe","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/fiXZHKpQmLD5SKjl31EtdMAWsLg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5dc3a36847f828c423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33535,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Don Christensen","original_name":"Don Christensen","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635f8c5240d0fe007acd0402","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl W.
