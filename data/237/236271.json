Porky is met by some weird-looking Indians, some of whom he takes back to the Old World to introduce to the court of Queen Isabella. A hush falls over the hall as the natives prepare to demonstrate their native dance. True to the Warner Bros. tradition, a wild jitterbug scene ensues with music from the studio orchestra.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":"/5gvmw5RJpYYy02ovRDGmam4jsYm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kristopher Kolumbus Jr.","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Clampett","original_name":"Robert Clampett","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/2x8KjXomM8psGFzNXgsGVbaSm5X.jpg","credit_id":"53d222260e0a265dfc00e525","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031543","wikidata_id":"Q28101322","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qnkGVOx1S49IMVxwI4TSyJUX5C4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1650,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5gvmw5RJpYYy02ovRDGmam4jsYm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1100},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1lGcsyZytCvB1zfZTjYPLn9jjOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bNWdcOZn5tkrl6GMUydWkSBM8La.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
