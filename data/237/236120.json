Old timer farmers rub shoulders with newcomer creative people which include some of Australia's most famous artists and composers seeking a tree change. They discover in Robertson there is more than just trees. Above all, the residents of Robertson want to retain their town as a rural village. Collectively the community, old and new, vigorously fight against the invasion of the outside world, threats of a large jail, bores which deplete the aquifers and coal seam gas mining. In a contemporary world that sometimes questions the advantages of social media technology, A Place Called Robertson is a snapshot of traditional Australian values, a magical film, celebrating the spirit that can be found in a small Australian rural village.","popularity":0.0572,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A magical film about a magical village","title":"A Place Called Robertson","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Williams","original_name":"Tony Williams","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/tdzqireYyJZaThFAPRG4gggwTUn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e55c3a36847f828a87f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2811824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Place Called Robertson Trailer 3 mins 43 sec","key":"OFRpu2mhtp4","published_at":"2013-04-02T17:23:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec722c3a368544800b758"}]}}}
