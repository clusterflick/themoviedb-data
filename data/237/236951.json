She throws them out, so they scheme to hurt themselves enough to get hospitalized, with no luck. Bluto gets a wall to fall on him, but stands in the window. Popeye tries to get run over by a steam-roller, but a street cleaner saves him. Bluto dives off a skyscraper - into a huge pile of mattresses. Popeye stands in a naval gunnery range, but the gunners miss the target. Bluto taunts a bull, but stands next to a billboard of an attractive cow, which distracts the bull. Popeye crashes a plane, but the ambulance crew rescues the plane. The boys compete to get run over by a train, but punch each other off the tracks just as the train arrives. Finally, Popeye forces a can of spinach down Bluto's throat and gets a pounding. That lands him in the hospital but not Olive's; they failed to notice the sign: \"Cat and Dog Hospital.\" They start fighting like cats and dogs, and get hauled off to the looney bin.","popularity":0.3778,"poster_path":"/lvm5x47eaC0WsEQ8tvfHys5ID9o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Better or Nurse","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Floyd Buckley","original_name":"Floyd Buckley","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/xYfiqIJgRWu09MLs2fvAd1EzzHS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"646736ded1857201403023f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"64673696d1857200e5a35925","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"646736a7c3514c013a54f530","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2901573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Welch","original_name":"Harry Welch","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/5K6m16t5jxe25EsM1w2JSgjH608.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"64673686a5046e01246719f6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e63c3a36847f828d84b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116338,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dave Tendlar","original_name":"Dave Tendlar","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64152b2be9c0dc008f7076a6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Stultz","original_name":"Joe Stultz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64152b0d0d5d85007b6757c3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599588,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Irving Dressler","original_name":"Irving Dressler","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64152b155690b50084df96ea","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458337,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John Gentilella","original_name":"John Gentilella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64152b336a222700c6b3376f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150609","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":865,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8fOMRuk8P44a45gBlSSbX0PxsY3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1537}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lvm5x47eaC0WsEQ8tvfHys5ID9o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fTeMdKas3XqhLpGid2GUZB9rlKE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
