The Captain, armed with a board, is standing guard (but not fixing the fence). He falls asleep, and the poultry attack, stripping the garden methodically. When the Captain comes after them, they lock him into a shed. He gets out, and fetches his shotgun. That stops them, and they drop their booty, until the Captain sets his gun down to collect the veggies; the birds all rush in, snatch them back.","popularity":0.5121,"poster_path":"/i1WncJPWpzEYGB8yK0gCykcD8Rs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poultry Pirates","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Captain","credit_id":"5547834692514119e0008ef6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Duck","credit_id":"5547834ec3a368573b00869a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e55c3a36847f828a9fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0030616","wikidata_id":"Q30754011","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jPhhs4PHXSUeTiF4LcRCinibut.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hcuBTDrZKj9EjWSmJ4Q44UMKqmH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i1WncJPWpzEYGB8yK0gCykcD8Rs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
