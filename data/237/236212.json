On arrival, we see some local scenes: A penguin eats two fish, then is eaten by the third; the dogs of a dog sled stop (behind an iceberg) at a telephone pole; a timber wolf goes around shouting \"Timber!\" Two Eskimos rub noses: in preparation, the woman applies lipstick to her nose. Finally, an Eskimo nightclub (after all, the nights are six months long) features a rotoscoped ice skater. The ship leaves, and gets caught in the fog near New York; when the fog clears, we see the ship is perched atop the World's Fair Trilon.","popularity":0.1199,"poster_path":"/7D8jpntIWRio3gEms8oZyJ5qIDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of the Midnight Fun","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tex Avery","original_name":"Tex Avery","popularity":0.5622,"profile_path":"/4jimJwW6FNAxBuM2CD1cZLK6Q5C.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e56c3a36847f828ada3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Melvin Millar","original_name":"Melvin Millar","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644d4bf353f83319ef191d77","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031552","wikidata_id":"Q6484228","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7D8jpntIWRio3gEms8oZyJ5qIDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/o53ZhCKqH4Avju8Hl50ZxyV7ZJc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
