Popeye wants to dance a waltz, pull taffy, play pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and croquet, and bob for apples, but Olive turns up her nose at all these as Bluto sabotages them. Finally, Bluto pours quick-drying cement in the apple water and drives off with Olive. Popeye, encased in cement, rolls downhill into a vegetable shop, right next to a bin of spinach. Good thing, because Bluto's getting fresh in a very old-fashioned way. A zoot-suited Popeye stops him, and gets the girl.","popularity":0.3182,"poster_path":"/yzhw4OugKyZbbfbl3kp0j3ZLjzA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jitterbug Jive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"640d059e014325009a381228","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"640d05aa323eba010b90414d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"640d05b501432500e39b3d1b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Tytla","original_name":"Bill Tytla","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e54c3a36847f828a6e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271320,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Germanetti","original_name":"George Germanetti","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640d053ea894d60079f9f3f4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640d04b901432500c0b93d4f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271320,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Germanetti","original_name":"George Germanetti","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640d0592b42242008a2d0ec6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3959584,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Harvey Patterson","original_name":"Harvey Patterson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640d0556e18e3f084039eea8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640d05231ac29200cd9549b9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3948280,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lloyd Hallock, Jr.","original_name":"Lloyd Hallock, Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640d052d1ac292008555802c","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"640d04c5a6c10400f760d0e7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151135","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yzhw4OugKyZbbfbl3kp0j3ZLjzA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/soGxNFZJOvODBMnsgzIp56s2V68.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
