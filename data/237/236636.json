He falls for an Indian maiden with a Brooklyn accent, but her very large boyfriend catches them. Daffy dresses in drag, which fools him for a while until Daffy's wig falls off.

The Indian sends smoke signals from a phone booth and his tribe attacks Daffy, trapping him under his house trailer.","popularity":0.3174,"poster_path":"/n3MsqXIGzqvC9xCwkzdmO7y7CXD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Daffy Duckaroo","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Daffy Duck / Little Beaver / Others (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"6484ab20c9dbf9011dfbffa2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Berner","original_name":"Sara Berner","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/cUvyj2PuoHU5FAtep9oOxLYaQEp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Daisy June (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"6484ab3799259c00e2f4e42d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173626,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norm McCabe","original_name":"Norm McCabe","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/fiXZHKpQmLD5SKjl31EtdMAWsLg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5dc3a36847f828c59d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Melvin Millar","original_name":"Melvin Millar","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644d4e592811a10383518931","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leon Schlesinger","original_name":"Leon Schlesinger","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/is9gdhtLfaCYwWdeACDgAjdDA1w.jpg","credit_id":"6484af3799259c01392b40d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0034630","wikidata_id":"Q7575494","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n3MsqXIGzqvC9xCwkzdmO7y7CXD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3oIozg6v9eWri0gBduydudFQWqI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
