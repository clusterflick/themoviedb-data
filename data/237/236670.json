They want to treat it as a house pet, despite the obvious problems; Popeye says no. They try to hide it, including painting a Hitler face on its rear and calling it a painter, but keep making mistakes like feeding it horseradish (great reaction shots). Finally, they hide the horse in the closet; Popeye comes out and says that they'll have to keep it now. We see why when she's sitting at the table with her four new foals.","popularity":0.2262,"poster_path":"/q4BQWvmwGPL3dCNhWqcTH4Z2ohr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Honor, the Mare","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Popeye (voice)","credit_id":"5d04bc3b0e0a267f2fca79ac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c763","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1503219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Ward","original_name":"Jack Ward","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d04bc1d9251416876bdb268","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"5d04bc020e0a260f82ca72b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150893","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxNLGxsZlePkgOhs2GBP7yvPX2y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q4BQWvmwGPL3dCNhWqcTH4Z2ohr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/huW2stirzdtqpuU2rylKSUdzuaL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
