But it soon transforms into a war of emotion, as they try to conquer each other in proposition. The weakest will fall in love. What happens is unplanned—the consequences of their game—as their real emotions become involved and they both fall in love. Both are losers, or winners, but neither is giving up. It is as if they had gone through an entire relationship in the time it took to read the audition—and now they must separate, as scripted, and end it. Like a break up, it is hard.","popularity":0.2882,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Audition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Bocci","original_name":"Marco Bocci","popularity":0.3188,"profile_path":"/iHE5tDPvkdr5VXF67bnQ9TiVkL8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Actor","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Solarino","original_name":"Valeria Solarino","popularity":0.2655,"profile_path":"/nTZR4KxmY0EPVc7ZphdvtyiNGQC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Actress","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fausto Maria Sciarappa","original_name":"Fausto Maria Sciarappa","popularity":0.149,"profile_path":"/rSZfhF5YKMx09Bs8sHdtzKNzIxC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simonetta Solder","original_name":"Simonetta Solder","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/fhgGjYGpE4nXgX6hoHZ6Gn3fF10.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Consuelo Madrigali","original_name":"Consuelo Madrigali","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7df","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Sireno","original_name":"Antonio Sireno","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7e3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Haussman","original_name":"Michael Haussman","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/1PxjjLY52KoAoyF25OWYXNXeQSv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Haussman","original_name":"Michael Haussman","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/1PxjjLY52KoAoyF25OWYXNXeQSv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c7cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3139094","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
