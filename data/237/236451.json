But the horse's mother pulls him away, saying we don't associate with that kind. Spunky makes a few more overtures, and eventually they set off on a chase, running across a bull from time to time. The horse stops to eat a lot of apples and drink far too much water; this leaves him too bloated to move much at all. The two continue to anger the bull, which gives chase; Spunky saves the colt, and they all live in harmony.","popularity":0.2922,"poster_path":"/AoaL6Flu1ffAmX4KJI160yayvx4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snubbed by a Snob","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hunky / Spunky / Stallions / Bull (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"56c81ef2c3a3684091001c4f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5bc3a36847f828bcc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lou Fleischer","original_name":"Lou Fleischer","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c81ee3c3a368408c001dec","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Stultz","original_name":"Joe Stultz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c81e909251411733001ca3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928927,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sammy Timberg","original_name":"Sammy Timberg","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c81ead925141172f001bae","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138173,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Stan Quackenbush","original_name":"Stan Quackenbush","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c81ec4c3a3684087001dff","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":606084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Fleischer","original_name":"Max Fleischer","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/m4i8FwtAeh3u1J01cdFsCf0G6VB.jpg","credit_id":"56e327e1c3a3685a960009e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599650,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Arnold Gillespie","original_name":"Arnold Gillespie","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b354337c3a368532f027c39","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0033066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8GD3R5Nc0LzVtAUOZPjwz4JjCme.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AoaL6Flu1ffAmX4KJI160yayvx4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3713,"name":"chase"},{"id":10360,"name":"prejudice"},{"id":14764,"name":"bull"},{"id":257807,"name":"cartoon horse"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":311143,"name":"cartoon donkey"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
