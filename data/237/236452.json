A dainty deer drinks very loudly and rudely from a lake. A pack rat swaps an egg and an acorn, then back again (\"monotonous, isn't it?\"). A flock of ducks lands; a hunter fires; all fly away, except one with an American flag on its side. A termite fells a huge tree. A cowboy rides across the plains well, no; his horse is just slapping itself with the front hooves. A coyote calls to its mate: \"Hey, Mabel, come on out!\" A camel contradicts the narrator, saying he's really thirsty. A wild dog: because of the lumbermen.","popularity":0.3293,"poster_path":"/zYCxKFJov3gEUBf7qdgc1lxBfb6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
