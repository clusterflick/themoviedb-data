He is sent to room 13, where his professor befuddles him with a tricky doorknob. Next, he goes to a tea party with his professor loosely disguised as an old lady; the butler serves a pot of \"T.N.Tea\" even though his back is full of knives. The professor keeps disappearing; the student tracks him by his footprints, even though the footprint powder at one point becomes train tracks and the doors he opens have a skeleton and some card-playing ghosts. Finally, the budding detective phones for the police; when they arrive (driving on the phone lines) and pile into the phone booth, he passes, and is given the first, second and (under bright lights) third degree.","popularity":0.1119,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vitamin G-Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hubley","original_name":"John Hubley","popularity":0.1673,"profile_path":"/iQ4sG12AEGOzYhdBH7DLSzTk1X4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c76f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":452840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sommer","original_name":"Paul Sommer","popularity":0.2796,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c775","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0153579","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
