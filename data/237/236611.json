When the dog awakes, the mouse hides in a hen's nest, and the cat disguises himself as a hen - and even does a hen imitation when the chicks hatch. The mouse then keeps pointing out the cat's hiding places, but when he points to a dump where the cat isn't hiding, the dog turns on him. The mouse paints an apple black and lights the fuse, but it explodes and sends him to mouse heaven.","popularity":0.4678,"poster_path":"/d7E3OIqLurMdxFBjcvZiJ9qw5zh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Chaser","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cat / Dog / Mouse Whistle (voice)","credit_id":"62d01eb96d9fe80055c83982","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5dc3a36847f828c4a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0034673","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ml79OeHigrS1Qws0do7lmCKndma.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qGSKN6YCDZWPwW077hBMFt64EDA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d7E3OIqLurMdxFBjcvZiJ9qw5zh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
