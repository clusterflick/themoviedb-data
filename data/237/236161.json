Large blotches of ink fall on the sheets of paper, and become wild African warriors and Harlem jitterbugs as the wind howls outside.

The maid comes in to clean the workroom, and finds nothing by ink smudges on scattered sheets of paper.","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voodoo in Harlem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cartoonist","credit_id":"52fe4e56c3a36847f828ab63","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225708,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rudy Zamora Jr.","original_name":"Rudy Zamora Jr.","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e752d8c3a3685af90016fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0153597","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
