He berates them for wasting time, and tells them the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, which inspires them to plant beans. Popeye falls asleep, and dreams up a giant beanstalk. His nephews talk him into climbing to the top. Inside the giant's castle, Popee hides in the cuckoo clock and spots the giant hoarding sugar instead of gold; his hen lays tires, and his storehouses are full of other goods that were rationed in World War II. Popeye tries to walk out with a stack of tires, but the giant stops him, ultimately swatting him with a fly swatter and making him into a sandwich; the giant sprinkles Popeye with pepper, delaying the inevitable spinach briefly. Popeye defeats the giant, and gets him to sneeze all his tires into a carpet.","popularity":0.1701,"poster_path":"/w0Wl9SMO7ERGpPoRKrOsaTiKAff.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ration Fer the Duration","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye","credit_id":"57befa94c3a36838d9005549","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e5ec3a36847f828c887","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"6422261d2dc9dc00a02d9640","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1503219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Ward","original_name":"Jack Ward","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642226292dc9dc007c072665","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116338,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dave Tendlar","original_name":"Dave Tendlar","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642226458d22fc01128b0762","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270369,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tom Golden","original_name":"Tom Golden","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6422264fc7a7e000c2b4f786","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w0Wl9SMO7ERGpPoRKrOsaTiKAff.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gesM0oGfHlSoN8e7qlBt1HRqROS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
