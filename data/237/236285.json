The statue of Nero comes to life and tries to burn the nearby painting of Rome but his matches go out. He tries to get a set of \"hear no evil\" monkeys to take the matches from a still life, but they refuse and he teases them. The other artworks come to their defense. Nero plays hurt, and gets the monkeys to help; after they stumble around in the still life for a while, they get drunk on lighter fluid and start breathing flames, which they combine with the fluid to act as a flamethrower. Soon, the museum is ablaze and all the paintings are either sounding the alarm or coming to fight the fire.","popularity":1.1516,"poster_path":"/l9rhINXWZB24SCMCMkJdlfHQQHV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Gallery","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Laughing Cavalier / Henry VII / Town Crier (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e8d75d79f0e190014f38240","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Rogers","original_name":"Kent Rogers","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ned Sparks (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e8d75ed9f0e190016f3954c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2139376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Hunter Parks","original_name":"Cora Hunter Parks","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vocalist (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e8d7600a314400012b68e0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberta Perkins","original_name":"Alberta Perkins","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vocalist (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e8d760a87e63e00172b54ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2593404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Mae Fritz","original_name":"Anna Mae Fritz","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":"/n5ec99VjlxMf5Kz2QgcYOXiovww.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vocalist (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e8d7611a314400012b68e35","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh Harman","original_name":"Hugh Harman","popularity":0.3973,"profile_path":"/6aVWLy6yqpN8OdrkLzH3LeUcO2N.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e57c3a36847f828b0bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l9rhINXWZB24SCMCMkJdlfHQQHV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
