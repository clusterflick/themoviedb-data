They are given the plans for a battleship; whichever finishes first gets the contract for the fleet. Bluto does his patriotic duty by refraining from his usual sabotage; his own incompetence provides much of the entertainment, until the end, when Popeye finishes first. Bluto, invited to help launch the ship, provides a bottle of champagne filled with nitroglycerine. Popeye's ship is destroyed, but after his spinach, he manages to turn out a ship every 5 seconds or so, launching an entire fleet for the war effort.","popularity":0.2109,"poster_path":"/4AuS89Q2IkM0y14SWBlVpozzN8w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hull of a Mess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye","credit_id":"57d9e4c4c3a36852f4008be3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Pennell","original_name":"William Pennell","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bluto","credit_id":"57d9e4ccc3a36853420083ea","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5dc3a36847f828c53b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4AuS89Q2IkM0y14SWBlVpozzN8w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/v7oQzuF1RAWQ6xDQxnWXrUq5YB9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
