The always-delectable (except when drawn by the Columbia animators on this cartoon series) Miss Daisy Mae Scragg is heartbroken as she does not share Abner's admiration of the two bachelors--a strictly platonic relationship---who share a cave pad outside the Dogpatch city limits. Neither does Mammy Yokum and she sets out to help Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat in a search for a wife, although Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat are not aware they are in the matrimony market nor that a search is in progress.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1944-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kickapoo Juice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Swift","original_name":"Howard Swift","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e62c3a36847f828d5bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146959","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
