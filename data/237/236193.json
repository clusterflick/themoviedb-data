He finds himself accidentally in the toreador box, even though he doesn't want to fight because it's cruelty to animals. Popeye rides the bull like a bronco, then gets tossed around a bit. The bull plants Popeye in the ground and attacks; the crowd turns on Popeye. Olive comes down to help and the bull chases her. The crowd throws vegetables at Popeye, including (fortunately) spinach.","popularity":0.2482,"poster_path":"/2D0fPVRDmnQZTab0vXv9l3Ncx6c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bulldozing the Bull","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"55386da592514138a9001453","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margie Hines","original_name":"Margie Hines","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"55386db49251416518008307","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e56c3a36847f828accd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029953","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":2097,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qHppRgAYhw3VBqGAz0qoDqL4un5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3733}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2D0fPVRDmnQZTab0vXv9l3Ncx6c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/k50bTqc6wUPOccidZuLZCxy8ALb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":734,"name":"bullfighting"},{"id":14764,"name":"bull"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
