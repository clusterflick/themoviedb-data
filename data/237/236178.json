Sight gags include an elephant who can't remember something he was supposed to do, and the game hunter riding a elephant and having to \"shift gears\" like an automobile to get up a steep hill.","popularity":0.8046,"poster_path":"/ybeWQ1GlC9yVRJMsmAzFmfa6qn6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Major Lied 'Til Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Bond","original_name":"Tommy Bond","popularity":0.1706,"profile_path":"/3EqE27w23CuOiNB7jdyhYN5SKJe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Little Boy (voice)","credit_id":"62cb20f6a698cf00509eb6d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Elephant (voice)","credit_id":"62cb2102e8131d0fb85ec7d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":375782,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tedd Pierce","original_name":"Tedd Pierce","popularity":0.2927,"profile_path":"/9S5zyGnMPpPXgRVLiq6rr9ioFjZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Major (voice)","credit_id":"62cb210fe8131d0fb9a761dc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Tashlin","original_name":"Frank Tashlin","popularity":0.3016,"profile_path":"/ejtsIZg2399mxvZeOaTQw7FlJMf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e56c3a36847f828ac0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0030402","wikidata_id":"Q7749684","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cKaJ4Aq7sLZWARBYZv5IAnyKg8k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ybeWQ1GlC9yVRJMsmAzFmfa6qn6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/eCKFlzc0gBEhq5pAYDNKZ2lW7A0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dMp8TtoUoaH0GXfjxrPMrTDwi6A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldEXsPFnDkytTt6LsiwP6ptb4AM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
