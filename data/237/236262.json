Momma sends him to bed, where he dreams of venturing out. He sees a sign looking for boys, no experience needed. It's Fagin's school, where he trains boys to steal. The cops raid the place. In the shootout, the phone rings; Fagin answers and passes the message on to a cop: bring home a pound of butter. Blackie dives out a window, gets tangled up in a curtain, and wakes up, tangled in his blanket; he runs downstairs and joins in \"Three Little Kittens.\"","popularity":0.3699,"poster_path":"/1JpOnLnCxsECrdfckvvATG0cU6Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fagin's Freshman","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Days","original_name":"Bill Days","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Singer (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bcbc53f83303ff2c139a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Hill-Talbot","original_name":"Margaret Hill-Talbot","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kitten (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bce9378062049f5f3bc8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Winkler","original_name":"Robert Winkler","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Black the Kitten (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bd0291745b004f252dcb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Berner","original_name":"Sara Berner","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/cUvyj2PuoHU5FAtep9oOxLYaQEp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mama Cat (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bd0d91745b0067427f85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Piano Conductor / Hogan (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bd1d91745b004f252de0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Hansen","original_name":"Bernice Hansen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/1T1q0UvWl1xO3pmUbUdDIXz6gvZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Three Little Kittens (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bd2ddd731b004c3655bb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":375782,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tedd Pierce","original_name":"Tedd Pierce","popularity":0.2927,"profile_path":"/9S5zyGnMPpPXgRVLiq6rr9ioFjZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Fagin (voice)","credit_id":"62d2bd3853f8330401f4d722","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e57c3a36847f828afbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573539,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cal Dalton","original_name":"Cal Dalton","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":"/wwEbwRnK5iB0FidjGx8kPWrsHYd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e57c3a36847f828afb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031290","wikidata_id":"Q101229312","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1JpOnLnCxsECrdfckvvATG0cU6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
