Fortunately, or unfortunately, the boys are driving by. They compete for the job. Chores: Getting water from a well, picking apples, shoeing a horse, gathering eggs. Popeye feeds a hen a little spinach, and she produces a mountain of eggs, which eventually end up all over Bluto. Bluto drops an anvil on Popeye, then goes after Olive against her wishes, chasing her into a succession of haystacks (where he finds a needle!). The chicken feeds Popeye his spinach, and he triumphs, sending Bluto into the pigpen (where the pigs won't have anything to do with him).","popularity":0.4786,"poster_path":"/91m5Cw9BbeQhxQLlSZcDHzmtZGF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Farmer and the Belle","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63ccfe75e24b93007cd51192","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63ccfe9b09dda400c0e38776","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"63ccfea99a643500825439bf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e54c3a36847f828a76b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640976eb31644b00e0da1cc6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Stultz","original_name":"Joe Stultz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640976faf9a3fb00f2d3ab06","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123500,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Little","original_name":"Robert Little","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6409770531644b00e0da1cd9","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315013,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Thomas Johnson","original_name":"Thomas Johnson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64097711f9a3fb007afa8c41","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270178,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Frank Endres","original_name":"Frank Endres","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6409771a32cc2b010b3f61ec","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/91m5Cw9BbeQhxQLlSZcDHzmtZGF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xF36zDIp0RJ5GfmoWlsIopDAOSB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
