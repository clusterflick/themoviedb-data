You’ll become that annoying person that sits your friends down to watch it, only to irritatingly nudge them in the ribs again and again whispering “this is a funny bit”.  Danny Bhoy, Live at Festival Theatre is the Scottish-recently-turned-Australian citizen’s fourth DVD, and like its predecessors is full of hearty laughs and some very quotable lines.  The performance shot in his “hometown” Edinburgh covers a range of topics from Scottish soccer, to sexting, gay Vikings and an encounter with Matt Damon.","popularity":0.0518,"poster_path":"/11ewQ7pLtEV6mRKNmb9nnKc08uk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danny Bhoy: Live at the Festival Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4154338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/11ewQ7pLtEV6mRKNmb9nnKc08uk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
