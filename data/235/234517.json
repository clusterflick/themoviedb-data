He chomps popcorn and continually ribs the magician about his \"easy\" tricks, finally driving most of the audience away. Then the magician calls Woody on stage to \"assist\" him in a few \"tricks,\" which enables him to get back at Woody for some of his taunts. Then Woody turns the tables, putting the magician under a magic spell. As the magician comes out of the spell, he tries to get rid of Woody by shooting him out of a cannon. But after the shot is fired, Woody's still there. In desperation, the magician climbs into the cannon and fires himself off the stage!","popularity":0.1337,"poster_path":"/t6Hc1HExUaX7Yuj4nNcAjZJqJW4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tragic Magic","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932741,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul J.
