The show actually starts with a great joke on the audience: Boy George, looking not a day over 20, glides onstage in his once-trademark derby and beaded hair extensions, delivering a warm and welcome vocal on \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\" The startled crowd soon realises he's an impersonator. The real, fortysomething George O'Dowd, looking a lot less androgynous and a tad thicker than in his New Romantic days, smiles self-deprecatingly and launches into a pleasing set of white soul (\"Cold Shoulder\", \"Miss Me Blind\"), stark gospel (\"That's the Way\"), stirring raga-rock (\"Bow Down Mister\") and even a classic (a lovely cover of Bowie's \"Starman\", complete with audience participation and muscular guitar by Roy Hay). It's a fine show all around.","popularity":0.5264,"poster_path":"/9R2nVqN4gGWbHO1axis79FDGJ1O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture Club Live At The Royal Albert Hall 20th Anniversary Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boy George","original_name":"Boy George","popularity":0.6734,"profile_path":"/7OFcmMshgwxMPbxB0UHs4qkz8nT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54fc947dc3a36869fb004a4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Moss","original_name":"Jon Moss","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/dchilTqT2gA1dWQOPvcuU3fMN9P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54fc94869251413aa0004c71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Hay","original_name":"Roy Hay","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/phFzNUhAJ1FwgKu63kVFRh8FjxE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54fc948d92514122040024a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikey Craig","original_name":"Mikey Craig","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/zU4wq4y2kDS0MZH14Jndu8X2Q4D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54fc94949251413aa0004c75","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9R2nVqN4gGWbHO1axis79FDGJ1O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
