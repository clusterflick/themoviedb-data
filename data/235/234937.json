Some - such as Piaf, Proust, Jim Morrison and Chopin - are worshiped to this day. Others have fallen into oblivion, or are visited occasionally by a single admirer. In Forever we see the mysterious, calming and consoling beauty of this unique cemetery through the eyes of people of flesh and blood. Many come for their 'own' beloved: husbands, wives, family and friends. Others Honor 'their' artist by leaving behind a personal message or a flower. While admirers share with us the importance of art and beauty in their lives, the graveyard gradually reveals itself as a source of inspiration for the living. Death offers little consolation except for the passing of time, the melancholia of a moss-covered tomb, and the beauty and power of a piece of music, a poem or a painting Written by Cobos","popularity":0.4501,"poster_path":"/wa3aOERe5sndwfIGg34jAJF1pgN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12023,"logo_path":"/97tVKGqnkjn0hwTGGRDPRgYWbrE.png","name":"NPS","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":52190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cobos Films B.V.","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forever","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"Para siempre","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le cimetière du Père-Lachaise","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Gia panta","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"永远","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshino Kimura","original_name":"木村佳乃","popularity":1.1005,"profile_path":"/oGf2V7K4wYGXnqDaldtz8LGw1rv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f82853f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertrand Beyern","original_name":"Bertrand Beyern","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f82853f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Solari","original_name":"Camille Solari","popularity":0.1401,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1d3c9192514103240624c4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f82853ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Alazraki","original_name":"Robert Alazraki","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/1oaFxGw0QSVUILrIaNShLOKT58O.jpg","credit_id":"5a1d3cdc0e0a264cd0064493","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ester Gould","original_name":"Ester Gould","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1d3caa9251410339063561","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heddy Honigmann","original_name":"Heddy Honigmann","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/hAcQIVYwDxJA8ZSiaPh5ux1yIG3.jpg","credit_id":"5a1d3cc90e0a264ccd0652bd","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007663,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danniel Danniel","original_name":"Danniel Danniel","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/wPJAy83HUfX3xSm8wbxods2L1tq.jpg","credit_id":"5a1d3cfe92514103330622f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Cobos","original_name":"Carmen Cobos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1d3cec0e0a264cbc066009","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Judith Vreriks","original_name":"Judith Vreriks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/r5ocjHzp4aBaAHDstW04etCyCDc.jpg","credit_id":"5a1d3cbcc3a3680b9a06876c","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0906743","wikidata_id":"Q13636884","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wa3aOERe5sndwfIGg34jAJF1pgN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1227,"name":"cemetery"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":2968,"name":"grave"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"NA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
