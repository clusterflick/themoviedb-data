Each story occurs at a specific mealtime, and seeks to interpret the frailties and complexities of love through different Asian perspectives. All three stories are tethered with the question, \"Will you marry me?\" Mirroring the repasts themselves, Breakfast and Dinner are heavier in tone, while Lunch is light with a sprinkle of humor.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/pJWL6bBYGOSoeNY7ibqvfoxDGFW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wormwood Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2010-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakfast Lunch Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1270265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Chien","original_name":"Beatrice Chien","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mei","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f828543b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Pin","original_name":"Wang Pin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mei","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f828543f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamolluk Piyavittayanon","original_name":"Kamolluk Piyavittayanon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mei","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f8285443","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaz Cai","original_name":"Kaz Cai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f8285419","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anocha Suwichakornpong","original_name":"Anocha Suwichakornpong","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/n08Xosh6Ffl3cr5of4AQfnwkDin.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f8285425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074959,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Soros Sukhum","original_name":"Soros Sukhum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f828542b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270262,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tay Bee Pin","original_name":"Tay Bee Pin","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f8285431","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dai Yuxin","original_name":"Dai Yuxin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a36847f8285437","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1909446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Jing","original_name":"Wang Jing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/y5VRfWCTzU5cqm8khS2GDbMMgGD.jpg","credit_id":"59eb48dd925141565100f79a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1913003","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/beCz4OZgmFYX0zjhYEQLxMAFh3U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iI8uWKoWVAebfZe5jlSDqSZde8F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pJWL6bBYGOSoeNY7ibqvfoxDGFW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner\"  (Lunch's Teaser)","key":"sb9lUcnkiXE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-11-02T19:01:57.000Z","id":"6230c462befd91001b1c1c8e"}]}}}
