Charlie passes himself off as the team's star but Bessie insists he was only good at being their \"water boy\". Charlie, determined to prove Bessie wrong, attempts to show Junior a thing or two about the game. But Bessie was right; Charlie isn't the most experienced athlete. He dresses as a tackling dummy which leads to disaster. He also gets the football caught in his mouth several times. Finally, he attempts to kick a field goal but the football has been set up a little too close to a water spigot and Charlie kicks the latter instead!","popularity":0.8494,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foot Brawl","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Frees","original_name":"Paul Frees","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/pACT0LYkEyff7PGt88iqr5u9T7u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charlie Beary / Junior Beary (voice)","credit_id":"56f1c67a9251412e160004a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Stafford","original_name":"Grace Stafford","popularity":0.4184,"profile_path":"/whvCHcXPSfUXx3satHc7Xz9vF3a.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bessie Beary (voice)","credit_id":"56f1c68dc3a36830290004ad","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932741,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul J.
