A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noblewoman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.","popularity":0.285,"poster_path":"/rz6oyXTOiUXrdeVflGXpQl233CD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":245,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lohengrin: Opera romantica in tre atti","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lohengrin","credit_id":"6265e9cd75f1ad00aab1a6af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Heinrich der Vogler","credit_id":"6265e9dc88b148009fea6536","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Dasch","original_name":"Annette Dasch","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Elsa von Brabant","credit_id":"6265e9ed2cff180050a48a1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tómas Tómasson","original_name":"Tómas Tómasson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Friedrich von Telramund","credit_id":"6265e9ff1495651655ff252f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Herlitzius","original_name":"Evelyn Herlitzius","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ortrud","credit_id":"6265ea10d8f44e12f00933e0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnalda Canali","original_name":"Arnalda Canali","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6265e99ff794ad0065481383","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"6265e9b36ca9a000aa7076c1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2562270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ecF4DO7c94IONsbmtrSHE7MPeq2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1859,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rz6oyXTOiUXrdeVflGXpQl233CD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1242}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":223965,"name":"la scala"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
