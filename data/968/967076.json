Futuristic, large-scale land reclamation projects are visible expressions of these investments. Two case studies are explored, ‘Forest City’ in Johor and ‘Melaka Gateway’ in Malacca, both launched in attractive places by the sea. Both are part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Initially hailed for boosting the economy and creating jobs, the projects subsequently attracted criticism for exacerbating social injustices and for impacting on the environment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flow of Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3521520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monika Arnez","original_name":"Monika Arnez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626599b775f1ad0066a8359c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3521521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monika Arnez","original_name":"Monika Arnez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626599be6eecee30f2d1910a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
