This future mourning gives a particular colour to his observation, a combination of indifference (the repetition of the days governed by the principle of subsistence) and acuity (the contemplation of small things and of lost moments). The value of the shots finds itself enhanced, from the tactile close-up that captures the elementary actions—cultivating, eating, smoking—to the widest frame, espousing with a final gaze the frontiers of world that is about to be incorporated by the filmmaker as an interior landscape, a mental object. - Emmanuel Chicon","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":"/i9oSvMTSRigWjUgTfVpaaa6NoBV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven in a Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3234354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Breton","original_name":"Stéphane Breton","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/76JP7NaHQeGNnWXkzihYYJVo8Bx.jpg","credit_id":"6265ef522cff180095dab032","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0421988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1606,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i9oSvMTSRigWjUgTfVpaaa6NoBV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1071}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Groix Island Film Festival","release_date":"2004-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
