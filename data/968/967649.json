Based on a childhood memory, the experimental short film spans from the Cold War Iron Curtain, to the so-called “refugee crisis” and the renewed closing of borders during COVID-19. Textures of walls closing in, blur with pixelated maps, creating a subjective portrait of a new reality and its digital image-world.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/atwwdpoyP0nTjdTYT3Z8In8jwDl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The world is blue at its edges","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3523352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Moderbacher","original_name":"Christine Moderbacher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626722505ab81a0052787618","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iris Blauensteiner","original_name":"Iris Blauensteiner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6267223e2b113d00a5c60ad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/atwwdpoyP0nTjdTYT3Z8In8jwDl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
