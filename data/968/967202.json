This programme tells the story of those wartime British bombers that have been largely 'forgotten' either because they have been overlooked in favour of the Lancaster and other four-engine 'Heavies' or because there has been very little film footage found (until now) of their service careers.  Aircraft such as the Avro Anson, Fairey Battle, Handley Page Harrow, Bristol Bombay, Vickers Wellesley, Handley Page Hampden, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Handley Page Halifax, Short Stirling, Bristol Blenheim, Martin Maryland, Martin Baltimore, Vultee Vengeance, Lockheed Hudson and Ventura, Consolidated Liberator and Boeing Flying Fortress are all featured in RAF service on this unique DVD.","popularity":0.0665,"poster_path":"/j815DEj9m3NT2DOUkiia7DfVIHS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leading Edge Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Bombers of the RAF","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3521980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Slater","original_name":"Jonathan Slater","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6265e7a6e329430066d4ad5c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6265e7ebaaec710067bfd6e3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2017942,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruce Vigar","original_name":"Bruce Vigar","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6265e7bd7caa4714b50338ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/K1o5yiepAlwwzcgpKHOk0XtJyd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2200}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j815DEj9m3NT2DOUkiia7DfVIHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Copyright on DVD is noted as 2021","release_date":"2001-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
