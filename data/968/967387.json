The action takes place mainly in the palace of the Dukes of Pszczyna, where the last great descendant of the von Teuss family resides. Prince Hans Fredrich marries the beautiful Englishwoman, Princess Daisy, and has three sons with her. Their fate, the choice of completely different life paths and even different nationalities reflect the enormously complicated mutual relations between the Polish and German elements in the border areas.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":331,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biała wizytówka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090397","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
