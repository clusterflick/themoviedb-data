General Secretary of the Colombian Communist Party at the time, Jose Elias married Esther Bloss and on the day of their wedding in the Sudeten he left to help build the Berlin Wall. He told off Che for not having read Marx, hung out with Tamara Bunke and advised against the rise up in arms of the newly founded guerrilla group ELN (National Liberation Army) in Colombia. In 1968 he returned to Colombia after being expelled from the Party, and grew apart from his children, because of geographical distance and political ideology.\" - Juana Awad","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9Ov99RiizjVTEgBCC2CGtQ0FVzZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Great Uncle Was Here Before","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3522230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juana Awad","original_name":"Juana Awad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"6266383ed8f44e12eef1512d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Elias Awad","original_name":"Jose Elias Awad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"62663850d1a89370954ce2e8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3522230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juana Awad","original_name":"Juana Awad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626638590929f61693c846de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Ov99RiizjVTEgBCC2CGtQ0FVzZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
