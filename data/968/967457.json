Having survived the tragic events of the Essex, one of the world’s most infamous seafaring disasters, and the true life events  that inspired Herman Melville’s novel Moby Dick, Pollard optimistically set sail for the Pacific once again in the whaleship Two Brothers, believing with all his heart “that it was an old adage that the lightning never struck in the same place twice.” In this case it did, and Pollard’s promising career  as a whaling captain came to a tragic end on an uncharted reef in the most remote archipelago on earth, and what is now Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. In 2008, a team of NOAA maritime archaeologists discovered the first clues of the whaleship Two Brothers and began to unlock the mystery of the only Nantucket whaleship ever found on the sea floor.","popularity":0.2222,"poster_path":"/15hLhXsEceQJw9hdZXpshP21qxe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lightning Strikes Twice: The Real-life Sequel to Moby Dick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephani Gordon","original_name":"Stephani Gordon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6c7b6c51acd007d56e05e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3408338","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/15hLhXsEceQJw9hdZXpshP21qxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":257981,"name":"moby dick"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
