The children can't speak Turkish, the teacher can't speak Kurdish and is forced to become an exile in his own country. On the Way to School is a film about a Turkish teacher who is alone in a village as an authority of the state, and about his interaction with the Kurdish children who have to learn Turkish. The film witnesses the communication problem emphasizing the loneliness of a teacher in a different community and culture; and the changes brought up by his presence into this different community during one year. The film chronicles one school year, starting from September 2007 until the departure of the teacher for summer holiday in June 2008. During this period, they begin to know and understand each other mutually and slowly.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":"/cSlbuuQJTL4pVDoey39b291WStn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Way to School","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":31,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"On the Way to School","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emre Aydin","original_name":"Emre Aydin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Emre","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c910515d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rojda Huz","original_name":"Rojda Huz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rojda","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c910515dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vehip Huz","original_name":"Vehip Huz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vehip Huz","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c910515e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zulkuf Huz","original_name":"Zulkuf Huz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Zülküf","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c910515e5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orhan Eskikoy","original_name":"Orhan Eskikoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46579251416c910515cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ozgur Dogan","original_name":"Ozgur Dogan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46579251416c910515d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1312137","wikidata_id":"Q7091610","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/70qtmISj7t3jHBFi7UNvvm3VnIz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1968,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cSlbuuQJTL4pVDoey39b291WStn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1378}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":10873,"name":"school"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
