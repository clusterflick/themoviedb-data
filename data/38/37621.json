Directed by Louis Mouchet, La Constellation Jodorowsky includes a lengthy on-camera interview with Jodorowsky in Spanish with subtitles. Marcel Marceau, Fernando Arrabal, Peter Gabriel, Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud, and Jean Pierre Vignau make appearances discussing their various projects with the director. In addition to the interview and film clips, Mouchet features some bizarre footage from Jodorowsky’s absurdist plays in which topless women splattered with paint writhe around the stage in a theatrical production meant to represent The Panic Movement, i.e., an artistic expression in which reason cannot fully express the human experience.","popularity":0.8591,"poster_path":"/tnhJK6rc864Ztt2ArSuShGmrmDH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jodorowsky Constellation","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","original_name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","popularity":0.5741,"profile_path":"/rNLy0GHNAdq4TpWOY0yVEnc1lyb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe465c9251416c91051eff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gabriel","original_name":"Peter Gabriel","popularity":0.2379,"profile_path":"/tDxkSylWjcJyzCUWEnzECyOGnWH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587e1756c3a36849ff021b1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Marceau","original_name":"Marcel Marceau","popularity":0.2459,"profile_path":"/v6JtkwZ6wtoc2rwlZ9u5mPyNGO8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587e176e9251414143017da9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62460,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jean Giraud","original_name":"Jean Giraud","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/6EJhk8CSqG3eQBmdEs21thKoXB1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587e17829251413f1b0261f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Arrabal","original_name":"Fernando Arrabal","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/duchIlZNQJUMT1HLKjqnAiv9X8D.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"587e179ac3a368494c0212b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Mouchet","original_name":"Louis Mouchet","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/gkmbEXbnqboNLXc9feNzH0FHpXa.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"589de08b9251412cc0009232","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Mouchet","original_name":"Louis Mouchet","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/gkmbEXbnqboNLXc9feNzH0FHpXa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe465c9251416c91051efb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Mouchet","original_name":"Louis Mouchet","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/gkmbEXbnqboNLXc9feNzH0FHpXa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe465c9251416c91051f05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dorothy Cox","original_name":"Dorothy Cox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587e1725c3a368426e019494","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109474","wikidata_id":"Q3207768","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tnhJK6rc864Ztt2ArSuShGmrmDH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6026,"name":"cinema on cinema"},{"id":886,"name":"movie business"},{"id":5451,"name":"comic book"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jodorowsky Constellation","key":"MIHpeZDMt28","published_at":"2006-09-10T18:26:48.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"587e1c16c3a36849ff021d10"}]}}}
