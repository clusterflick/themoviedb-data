They brought their psychedelic fusion of blues and pop into the mainstream with albums like FRESH CREAM and WHEELS OF FIRE; Clapton, long regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, did some of his best work on those albums. London's Royal Albert Hall, the site of what was supposed to be Cream's final performance back in 1968, was also the venue for their reunion show. Sounding as if they'd been on vacation for a few weeks instead of disbanded for well over three decades, Cream brought the house down with a series of four shows, all of which are excerpted here. The band performs classics like \"Spoonful,\" \"Born Under a Bad Sign,\" \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" and \"White Room,\" among more than 20 others.","popularity":0.7057,"poster_path":"/m1eftlWtfaCfI8vaTfdMEPMNObf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cream performed for the first time in 37 years in May 2005","title":"Cream: Royal Albert Hall","video":true,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Cream: London 05","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Cream: Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6 2005","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cream - Royal Albert Hall","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Bruce","original_name":"Jack Bruce","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/44ZS1s2iKgnjHEq7mv0QtJOKdKW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Bass, Double Bass, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe466a9251416c91053c61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginger Baker","original_name":"Ginger Baker","popularity":0.15,"profile_path":"/sMxvUPji4ZEJNEksnph95peiidN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself - Drums, Vocals","credit_id":"5acf58360e0a2631e705e3b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Clapton","original_name":"Eric Clapton","popularity":0.4451,"profile_path":"/xAt8X2SzU4gghOyf8xjPPknHNyv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Guitar, Vocals","credit_id":"5acf58730e0a267f9a03c4a9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martyn Atkins","original_name":"Martyn Atkins","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe466a9251416c91053c6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549395,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Eaton","original_name":"Michael Eaton","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/6XPzUuuuJ5RGbKV1QHdDpWblOhm.jpg","credit_id":"56708e31c3a3680e7300face","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1132580","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/pr49dSgpcIIcaPI0sutL7fiDmjM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/aN9CfS0GkWy0QvB9eGWCDMWtirW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZxKIkOhs76skQsP7ISVksxKtWI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":992,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m1eftlWtfaCfI8vaTfdMEPMNObf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":661}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
