To ferret out the problem, he sends a four-man crew on Flight 412. Shortly into the test, the jet picks up three blips on radar, and subsequently, two fighters scramble and mysteriously disappear. At this point, Flight 412 is monitored and forced to land by Digger Control, a top-level, military intelligence group that debunks UFO information. The intrepid colonel, kept in the dark about his crew, decides to investigate the matter himself.","popularity":1.8148,"poster_path":"/lqfwjIJrAec4tso2grbsU2apI5E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disappearance of Flight 412","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Ford","original_name":"Glenn Ford","popularity":0.7917,"profile_path":"/5HGIsOVaVwlc4brv7IdVJ7ncEZ5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Colonel Pete Moore","credit_id":"52fe46519251416c91050995","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradford Dillman","original_name":"Bradford Dillman","popularity":0.586,"profile_path":"/o86FOgoC3gWy44KFMdyKb8G4O0F.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Maj.
