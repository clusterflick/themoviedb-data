In the space of 48 hours, a friend dies of an overdose, they are ripped off by criminals and arrested and assaulted by police. They bungle a break-in, get chased by hooligans and one is sent to a methadone clinic. The search for drugs veers between farce and tragedy, but it never stops.","popularity":0.405,"poster_path":"/9xqaZ1qtuTkXW9u7eW7nDQpaRmR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Radio and Television Board of the Australia Council","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1975-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Humour... in a black vein","title":"Pure Shit","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Pure Shit","type":"Uncensored"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Pure S","type":"Censored"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Hetherington","original_name":"Anne Hetherington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sandy","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117830,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helen Garner","original_name":"Helen Garner","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jo","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Porter","original_name":"Carol Porter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gerry","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Motherwell","original_name":"Phil Motherwell","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Laurie","original_name":"John Laurie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Waddell","original_name":"Gary Waddell","popularity":0.2445,"profile_path":"/zxl2fmCKepHO7QmXGxKaK7pkdFf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lou","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3565790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Williamson","original_name":"James Williamson","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Orderly","credit_id":"6737a1a880fda6e3e3746b36","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Weis","original_name":"Bob Weis","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/i9Vnw4Qfnt3robQ7SvZ8XAK0EBz.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Deling","original_name":"Bert Deling","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46509251416c910507bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120658,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Cowan","original_name":"Tom Cowan","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e230f7ebfeb8b0015d192c3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30461,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Scott","original_name":"John Scott","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e230f60bfeb8b0015d19282","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075111","wikidata_id":"Q7261128","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1260,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9xqaZ1qtuTkXW9u7eW7nDQpaRmR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":840},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ugrgOytcJdefJstEEWsupbWVk2y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":991,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8VZujOOO4ZRkJSR03RrO0e3Fj7R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"R 18+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
