The film explores the movement both as a native American philosophy stemming from 19th century American traditions of individualism, and as a foreign ideology brought to America by immigrants. The film features rare archival footage and interviews with significant personalities in anarchist history including Murray Boochkin and Karl Hess, and also live performance footage of the Dead Kennedys.","popularity":0.6719,"poster_path":"/82zGHBedJtTLdwgXFa6T8HCiHlX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anarchism in America","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jello Biafra","original_name":"Jello Biafra","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/ddoHZlkbI9WbimJRjIigwfQDlMm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46359251416c9104cdf5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Avrich","original_name":"Paul Avrich","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46359251416c9104cdf9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murray Bookchin","original_name":"Murray Bookchin","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46359251416c9104cdfd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Hess","original_name":"Karl Hess","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46359251416c9104ce01","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Sucher","original_name":"Joel Sucher","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46359251416c9104cdf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Fischler","original_name":"Steven Fischler","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46359251416c9104cdeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0186820","wikidata_id":"Q4751628","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l3QAdHdnmS1qesH7JvvOY99LHi6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1014,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/82zGHBedJtTLdwgXFa6T8HCiHlX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":676},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uqHy8RWFoMIMVB5M6elbx36Nmaj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"},{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"},{"id":2355,"name":"american dream"},{"id":3263,"name":"american  way of life"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":5879,"name":"anarchist"},{"id":11595,"name":"american culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
