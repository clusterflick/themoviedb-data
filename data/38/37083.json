In addition to Ernest Borgnine’s brilliantly sensitive portrayal as Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino, this engrossing picture is deftly photographed by Lucien Ballard, beautifully scored by David Raksin with a stellar supporting cast including Zohra Lampert and Alan Austin. Literate, suspenseful and emotionally moving, this memorable film remains the definitive depiction about the emergence of the Mafia in America.","popularity":1.2297,"poster_path":"/dGKWWLhxiAq99LnlePc5y1Chdwk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Artists Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Threat...and The Picture...You'll Never Forget!","title":"Pay or Die!","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Borgnine","original_name":"Ernest Borgnine","popularity":1.6246,"profile_path":"/JSHX01ZFEkIvt17HoeedsvCz1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Police Lt.
