Interviewing an increasingly mentally unstable Wuornos, Broomfield captures the distorted mind of a murderer whom the state of Florida deems of sound mind -- and therefore fit to execute. Throughout the film, Broomfield includes footage of his testimony at Wuornos' trial.","popularity":2.0612,"poster_path":"/6MJpX3xlQicN2zIBhPsjpyyIWH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lafayette
