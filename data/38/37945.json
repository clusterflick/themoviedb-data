With Eleanor out of the way he can have his dalliances with his young mistress. Needless to say the queen is not pleased, although she still has affection for the king. Working through her sons, she plots the king's demise and the rise of her second and preferred son, Richard, to the throne. The youngest, John, is an overweight buffoon and the only one holding his father's affection is the king's choice after the death of his first son, young Henry. But John is also overly eager for power and is willing to plot his father's demise with middle brother Geoffrey and the young king of France, Phillip. Geoffrey sees his younger brother's weakness and sees that route as his path to power. Political and court intrigue ensues.","popularity":2.8465,"poster_path":"/f6yEfCBBMNp6jdny9AD4ZTG9tgi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flying Freehold Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":21909,"logo_path":null,"name":"HCC Happy Crew Company","origin_country":""},{"id":4056,"logo_path":"/dnz7zZ2e11usyjPG3mTYvJfyciD.png","name":"Hallmark Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matt IV","origin_country":""},{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All of Britain and half of France were his kingdom.
