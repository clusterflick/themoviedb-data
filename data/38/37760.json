Kamelot enlisted renowned film and video director Patric Ullaeus to chronicle the night's events. Arriving with him from Gothenberg, Sweden, Patric had a large crew of professionals and equipment including 18 cameras that would be used in and around the concert grounds. The title for the band's first DVD (based on an earlier Kamelot song title) was chosen long before the actual shoot. Ironically this winter turned out to be one of the longest and coldest in the country's history, with enormous amounts of snow and numerous chaos-causing blizzards. A very special thanks goes out to fans that had to wait in line before doors opened to the sold out show. We sincerely hope we managed to warm you back up!","popularity":0.1411,"poster_path":"/owSsHd3gp9pDZ3Me3EiLG8tz6l0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolver Film Company","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":177,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rockefeller Musichall in Oslo, Norway on 11 February 2006","title":"Kamelot: One Cold Winter's Night","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Khan","original_name":"Roy Khan","popularity":0.2134,"profile_path":"/5P1cvw7ydASL9G2PPXTY9ZK6K1V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Vocals","credit_id":"52fe466c9251416c910540bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Youngblood","original_name":"Thomas Youngblood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/691CbQMALVyQEWFTYQPPXSAweQF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Guitar","credit_id":"52fe466c9251416c910540c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Grillo","original_name":"Casey Grillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oBSuPeFxyJF0gS4Md5GIy7ow3D3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Drums","credit_id":"52fe466c9251416c910540c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":118527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Palotai","original_name":"Oliver Palotai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cmwjy6CF7DnOFpHuyHOuGBOSo14.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Keyboards","credit_id":"52fe466c9251416c910540cd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1502972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Simons","original_name":"Simone Simons","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/ntQMjR1s1iwIzdkxEJB65TiL5b.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Herself - Guest Vocals","credit_id":"5b75ea63c3a368754b01bd04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sascha Paeth","original_name":"Sascha Paeth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mvaWDKO8CgjLyr2Zd89NTR9DxJy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Guest Guitar","credit_id":"535ed2760e0a264fe8006c2a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Christians","original_name":"Sean Christians","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bxIwYlaxJ1NsjZqKv1Z87KoWEgd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself - Bass","credit_id":"535f341a0e0a264feb007258","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patric Ullaeus","original_name":"Patric Ullaeus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cidRmpBB4mPtRQSdFb8fbRqfoll.jpg","credit_id":"52fe466c9251416c910540d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patric Ullaeus","original_name":"Patric Ullaeus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cidRmpBB4mPtRQSdFb8fbRqfoll.jpg","credit_id":"564e02f5c3a368602e00ac2a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patric Ullaeus","original_name":"Patric Ullaeus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cidRmpBB4mPtRQSdFb8fbRqfoll.jpg","credit_id":"564e02e6c3a368602e00ac28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patric Ullaeus","original_name":"Patric Ullaeus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cidRmpBB4mPtRQSdFb8fbRqfoll.jpg","credit_id":"564e03079251416de3007682","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2821396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qlEfOcxsyuXxsbGFbk8KA5UcOAz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/owSsHd3gp9pDZ3Me3EiLG8tz6l0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1076,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/63mIpkxIG1IecKvFXEnwTJnXU9b.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":762}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
