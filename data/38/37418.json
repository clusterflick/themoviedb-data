Basically, you use it to defend yourself, without having the right to use it for unfair attacks.\" (Pierre Bourdieu) The world has witnesses who speak out loud what others keep to themselves. They are neither gurus, nor masters, but those who consider that the city and the world can be thought out. The sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu is one such witness.\" Over a three- year period, Pierre Carles' camera followed him through different situations: a short conversation with Günter Grass, a lively conference with the inhabitants of a working-class suburb, his relations with his students and colleagues and his plea that sociology be part of the life of the city. His thinking has a sort of familiarity, which means it is always within our reach. It is the thinking of a French intellectual who has chosen to think his times.","popularity":0.473,"poster_path":"/pvi2TSmbf6ZmVFEkhMR4uw7eSuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116557,"logo_path":null,"name":"C-P
