Both a social justice story and a personally driven narrative, the film chronicles this capital case from 1984 through 2004. With exclusive footage from two decades, the film frames the judicial and emotional response to a chilling crime - and the implications that reverberate from Hunt's conviction - against a backdrop of class and racial bias in the South and in the American criminal justice system.","popularity":0.1945,"poster_path":"/tidsyiDMAUPgGK9Sq2xO5nUZfuY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10369,"logo_path":"/eT8TvahxgY8tJ7IuivC5uomXLT1.png","name":"Break Thru Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A battle for truth.
