Morgan listens sceptically to the dazed denials of Van Rooyer as he tells the story of his relationship with the murdered woman. Morgan, after hearing the story, realizes that the mystery has deepened, and it becomes more complicated when the Assistant Commissioner, Sir Brian Lewis, explains that Jacqueline was not married but was being kept by Sir Howard Fenton, a high-ranking diplomat whose names must be kept out of the case.","popularity":1.1228,"poster_path":"/9Cqpi47eDzd4QZS1TJdwhN70Mz3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Artists","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":13580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sydney Box Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1959-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Date","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chance Meeting","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'enquête de l'inspecteur Morgan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardy Krüger","original_name":"Hardy Krüger","popularity":0.6461,"profile_path":"/mWykFvz2kjBtx8uA3X3yK6mmWlH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jan-Van Rooyer","credit_id":"52fe46349251416c9104cba3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Baker","original_name":"Stanley Baker","popularity":0.6356,"profile_path":"/gpQD0tetGSWWTQvr3xphHs5H6Xs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Insp.
