Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, America suffered its bloodiest year in Vietnam and drugs seduced us. Yet idealism--and hope--flourished. Explore the significance of that turbulent year and the way it continues to affect the American landscape. Tom Brokaw offers his perspective on the era and shares the rich personal odysseys of some of the people who lived through that chaotic time, along with the stories of younger people now experiencing its aftershocks. Includes archival footage and interviews with former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who was talking to King when he was assassinated and rushed to his side to try to staunch the wound; Olympic gold medalist Rafer Johnson, who wrestled RFKs' assassin to the ground; and Arlo Guthrie, best known for his song \"Alice's Restaurant.","popularity":0.4311,"poster_path":"/n8Edw2HPZuBSKTVeHxvrnhSEM6O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5656,"logo_path":"/kUTaaU9zNDeocRqWGVUeJ630yLz.png","name":"Peacock Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The year that Everything changed.","title":"1968 with Tom Brokaw","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Brokaw","original_name":"Tom Brokaw","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/ao4AmrHwEeDd2IQKhlHATnaRIDB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46379251416c9104d12f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Brokaw","original_name":"Tom Brokaw","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/ao4AmrHwEeDd2IQKhlHATnaRIDB.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46379251416c9104d135","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1148684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1007,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8Edw2HPZuBSKTVeHxvrnhSEM6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":701}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11660,"name":"hippie lifestyle"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
