A complete studio performance of each song is captured by four cameras as Neil lays down the fiery, creative drumming for which he is known-but with new finesse gained from two years of devotion to study and practice. Following each performance, Neil presetlts a specific analysis of the drum part's relation to other elements in the song, as well as breaking down and demonstrating key sections, fills, and solos.","popularity":0.3733,"poster_path":"/5a0dUlfx58PpUz61juqmcbFs79P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neil Peart: A Work in Progress","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Peart","original_name":"Neil Peart","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/q5VO9FDmiG7iz36SBfj5m1UfH33.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe467a9251416c91055c63","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Siegel","original_name":"Paul Siegel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467a9251416c91055c69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Siegel","original_name":"Paul Siegel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467a9251416c91055c6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Wallis","original_name":"Rob Wallis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467a9251416c91055c75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Wallis","original_name":"Rob Wallis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467a9251416c91055c7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5R4O6dKvH0x5xHSFsZ8KaPM6kKV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6lhO8feaEwXr17S7snIOgaiMS3y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":830,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5a0dUlfx58PpUz61juqmcbFs79P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
