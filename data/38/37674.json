A story capturing the poetic nature of street basketball, highlighting the struggles endured on and off the court by the purest of athletes. Constantly searching for sanity in the midst of alcoholism, racism, and drugs, John Hogan and Jacob Whitmore, two junior college basketball players, find release and therapy while competing at one of the most competitive and poetic street courts in the U.S. Both men must spend an entire summer helping one another overcome their adversities. Their dedication and love for the game of basketball transcends from the playground courts into each of their dysfunctional households where the two boys play the constant role of the father figure. Together, the two boys paint a sad and delightful portrait with their innocence, concerns, and faith in the unknown.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/g9Tyl2FQqiSRpjkt3pZny7hoJFL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Streetballers is for basketball, what Field of Dreams was for baseball.","title":"Streetballers","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3564702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Scott Krentz","original_name":"Matthew Scott Krentz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John","credit_id":"628f6fe2cddbbc0e1bc3643d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrieanne Perez","original_name":"Adrieanne Perez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"628f6ffc209f1812c4a624e6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3564702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Scott Krentz","original_name":"Matthew Scott Krentz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628f6fad7d5db510a659683a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony E.
