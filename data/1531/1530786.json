The film's soundtrack features folk songs about the Erie Canal.  The singer is not credited.  The singer sounds like it is Pete Seeger.  If it really is Pete Seeger, then there are two interesting aspects.  First is he is playing the guitar instead of his signature banjo.  Second, these songs are all studio versions.  The only released versions I could find from Pete are live versions, which would make these versions fairly rare.
