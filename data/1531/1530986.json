During all those years, they had a lot, five children, Tatjana, Davorina, Nina, Denisa and Sandro. In all those years, they lost a lot. War, refugees, loss of family members... They survived all that together, raising their children to be successful and honest people. Through photos from family albums and personal and archival footage, as well as their conversations with their children and friends, we see how Nermina and Marinko dream of Srebrenica as it once was, full of people and with a developed economy, while today their town is becoming a ghost town, and they have to go to neighboring towns for the most basic foodstuffs.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/k2Es67uUx4agig5cntkwyMNuawm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179373,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Davorin Sekulić","original_name":"Davorin Sekulić","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68a088fb58e0157fce18c697","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1340,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k2Es67uUx4agig5cntkwyMNuawm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bs","note":"AJB DOC Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bs","note":"Sarajevo Film Festival","release_date":"2025-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
