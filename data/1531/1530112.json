When Brandon begins to ask questions, Rob opens up about his time in Vietnam—stories of loss, fear, and brotherhood that he’s carried for decades. But what begins as a moment of bonding quickly spirals into a confrontation between two generations divided by values, memory, and the blurred morality of war. Fireside Conversations is a stirring short film about legacy, trauma, and what happens when the past refuses to stay buried.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/uRz8pzgXdUhCGuPvpdbXNMwuZFz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":271126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premiere
