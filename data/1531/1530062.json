But when a mission goes sideways, he's given one last shot at redemption: track down and eliminate Mason Ryker, the final ghost of the feared underground unit known as The Order of the Dragon. As Rico's mission leads him to a small, danger-ridden town in Serbia, the lines between good and evil begin to blur. Is Ryker the monster he's made out to be, or is there a deeper conspiracy at play? What begins as a black-and-white hit spirals into a moral storm-and time is running out.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":149553,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dream
