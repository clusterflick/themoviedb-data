Some footage was shot live-action, 16mm, and then reanimated on an animation stand. We would blow up frames onto large Kodalith sheets, adding gels and make many overlapping passes on the stand. We edited the visuals to the beat of the soundtrack. It was all experimentation, new ground for us.\" -- Filmmaker Phyllis Chillingworth","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Zoo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phyllis Chillingworth","original_name":"Phyllis Chillingworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689f5b03a4875980485d2d12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Goetz","original_name":"Charles Goetz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689f5b1edc60600e6a8dcd58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
