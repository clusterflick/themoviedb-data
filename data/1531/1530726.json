Victim of multiple fractures and total paralysis on his left side, Escoffier managed to walk again, despite the doctors' pessimistic prognoses... The commentary on images of Éric Escoffier in his daily life in Chamonix and archive images and photographs alternates with archive documents, extracts from the films \"Profession grimpeur\" by Philippe Lallet and \"Face nord\" by Jean Afanassieff as well as interviews with the protagonist, Rémi Éric Escoffier and Michel Garcia. Great among the greatest, Éric Escoffier, who disappeared in the mountains at Broad Peak on July 29, 1998, will never have been an ordinary man.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gYfnIDxjXGUxEU4kShEp70uMe6a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Éric Escoffier - Portrait of a Man Who Became Ordinary","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"إريك إسكوفييه - صورة لرجل أصبح عاديًا","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3382548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Escoffier","original_name":"Eric Escoffier","popularity":1.3411,"profile_path":"/9RuhniA3gzKasETL6DN0vAI3lM0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"689fc079f123f51086ec736d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5628754,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rémi Escoffier","original_name":"Rémi Escoffier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wuK2s7BOBq8gegb8NZjHHmy2ZjZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"689fc232d0abb0ff2b3bc2ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5628802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Garcia","original_name":"Michel Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/e90lR4PsAL8TBYyDPGutvExWIUf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"689fce3e9173595d027bc91e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4009740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Schaffter","original_name":"Stéphane Schaffter","popularity":0.2648,"profile_path":"/nM6bsXxHYwDZoFHD1KOgKXvotEv.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"689fe4fd35f315209a85b932","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235010,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Christophe Hainaud","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Hainaud","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/yv7sTwv32DV9q21GJz2kO03GGTX.jpg","credit_id":"689fc0b50ae0fbd4268fef3c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4556241,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Gautier","original_name":"Denis Gautier","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689fc0ea032c8ba0cb339057","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Beccu","original_name":"Pierre Beccu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689fc0f97fd2c820e03bc27d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628751,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michelle Huguin","original_name":"Michelle Huguin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689fc171b34047f9e58feeac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628752,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Christian Sibold","original_name":"Christian Sibold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689fc1ae6a07f329e1dcd6c0","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628753,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Muhet","original_name":"Jean-Paul Muhet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689fc1e5c5894ec903d414f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mix Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37930253","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n4Qy40weGHCsBVa9m4FJLvGO19O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gYfnIDxjXGUxEU4kShEp70uMe6a.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nzJBrPXMnhbq4xvNpSZ2PgwZ7Ne.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":197623,"name":"free climbing"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":301436,"name":"eric escoffier"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":357196,"name":"portrait of a climber"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
