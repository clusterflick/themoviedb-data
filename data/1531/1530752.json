It was a place in Michigan that was surrounded by mystery, religion, romance, baseball, travel, sex, scandal, and huge wealth.  It was all based on an unusual religious colony that called themselves the “House of David”. Their leader and founder Benjamin Purnell preached that he was teaching the way to have “eternal life of the body” and the way to live forever on earth.  Converts traveled from afar to hear the message and many would join their colony, giving up all of their worldly possessions in exchange for the promise of everlasting life.  They came from all corners of the globe to see what they were being told was “Paradise on Earth”.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4i7IATTErEjrzUkURbWsca8PVTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary","title":"House of David - Life Everlasting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Adkin","original_name":"Claire Adkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"689fd597eddbeedc4cdcd720","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Siriano","original_name":"Chris Siriano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Actor/Executive Producer","credit_id":"689fd5aede908a46cc339085","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5628847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Byrd","original_name":"Rob Byrd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689fd55f1799b690b73bc2bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21482998","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1W13XaM2ky7LkQYritp9y6ssPDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4i7IATTErEjrzUkURbWsca8PVTM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":211349,"name":"religious community"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
