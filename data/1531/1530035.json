Pandorra, looking for an audience for his demonstrations, found in Gibson a skeptic about psychic phenomenon, but a believer in chasing a dream. A Question of Reality is a virtual frantic monologue as Pandora attempts to demonstrate the reality of psychic phenomenon. Success and failure at cards and a link to UFO's underscore a desperate effort to be as famous as Uri Geller. Gibson shows the audience a warm and humorous account of life in pursuit of a dream.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Question of Reality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5625648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Gibson","original_name":"Barry Gibson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689dfc763d8d61e18d26953d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
