The film follows her eventful life - from a childhood filled with guilt to her literary work alongside Christine NÃ¶stlinger and Mira Lobe, giving a voice to marginalized outsiders. In her writer's workshops she supports homeless people or farmers with little connection to writing to find their own voice. But a sudden stroke robs her of her own voice and mobility. A touching portrait of an extraordinary author who overcomes both her own and others' silence - never ceasing to tell stories.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":271117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plaesion - Film + Vision e.U.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Renate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5625732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Welsh","original_name":"Renate Welsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"689e077d147fe15bf75e4934","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5311393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Nguyen","original_name":"Martin Nguyen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e07acc69f05151e2695c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5311393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Nguyen","original_name":"Martin Nguyen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e07b89e81e6e63b269215","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5311393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Nguyen","original_name":"Martin Nguyen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e07ce914c8546a18dbfd1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238169,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Astrid Heubrandtner","original_name":"Astrid Heubrandtner","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e07d5993a5e97772691eb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1647682,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esther Fischer","original_name":"Esther Fischer","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e07e8afc68ae3542691e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Janecek","original_name":"Peter Janecek","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e07f0da9b244a391a3fce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29742753","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
