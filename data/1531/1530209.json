The U.S. Army set up a court-martial to try them. Almost by chance, it hired the writer Louis Guilloux as an interpreter. Little by little, the novelist discovered that only African-American soldiers were sentenced, often to death. He recounts this in a short story: \"Okay, Joe!\"  By comparing his account with historical reality and the recollections of witnesses and descendants, this documentary reveals several taboos of World War II: the atrocities committed by the U.S. Army against civilians, the rape of women, racial segregation, and the cruel and selective punishments it inflicted on its Black soldiers. The film tells a little-known side of World War II.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Okay, Joe! or the Memoirs of Private Guilloux","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Okay, Joe! oder die Memoiren des Gefreiten Guilloux","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"¡Vale, Joe! o las memorias del soldado Guilloux","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525458,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Guilloux","original_name":"Louis Guilloux","popularity":0.2357,"profile_path":"/uzX05LX3vzMx5rh6xOh0cDy8IiS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"689e5d8086c32cdfa28ec331","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5626443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Baron","original_name":"Philippe Baron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689e5dd80022c5c7938ec10f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
