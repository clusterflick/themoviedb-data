A crossroad of stories, edifications, hopes, and conflicts altogether. Social ties and cultures take root. People nurture sympathy and care for their equals, but also animosity towards those who are different. It does not take long for an ‘us versus them’ atmosphere to take over. From the Main Square is an interactive VR experience that invites the viewer to witness the rise and fall of a divided society. A civilization blossoms, with all its contradictions, only to become a danger to itself.","popularity":0.1317,"poster_path":"/7QXWgLuTGNBbapjulOukulgTfuw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86782,"logo_path":"/zuXKoPd9apgEOvy6rHthcEjJkR7.png","name":"Filmuniversität Babelsberg
