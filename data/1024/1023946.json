Featuring bits about growing up in New York, the material is neither profane nor squeaky clean – but has a slice of life element obviously lacking in the cuddly Carlin of the '60s. There’s a gold star moment of longhaired George mocking a cardboard cutout of the suit and tie version, and so take-em-or-leave-them musical appearances by BB King and Kris Kristofferson. Certainly, worth a modern glance.","popularity":0.8942,"poster_path":"/pQTEcnQYOoFGABdKrxwiHNZnjkS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Carlin: The Real George Carlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Carlin","original_name":"George Carlin","popularity":0.8269,"profile_path":"/6YKQHJzml6XviUADpSC6kfF56W9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63203c5e3927120083294363","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.B.
