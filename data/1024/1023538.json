He creates a “flicker” effect by rapidly switching between the images captured by these cameras, shifting the spatial perspective from one side to the other. This effect becomes especially interesting when Stark does things like look side to side, or sway his right arm, then the left. He showcases his ability to confuse and distort his body’s own form.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/iUmA7ewsE9hRtXEnmJ4m5X3THTq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shape Shift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Stark","original_name":"Scott Stark","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631ed5d58566d2007df6c597","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iUmA7ewsE9hRtXEnmJ4m5X3THTq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
