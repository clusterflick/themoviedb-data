The soil is poor, there are no trees and the landscape resembles the moon. Is this what the future of desertification will look like? Incredible creatures with surprising behavior live in this strange landscape. The documentary explores a place with very dry skin but a wet hidden heart where even waterfowl or amphibians can live. Living in such conditions is not easy and only the toughest animals will survive.","popularity":1.1456,"poster_path":"/3zVNtkSpbYfGIBYYznWDmCHNzkc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alvaro Mendoza Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Get to know the Bardenas Reales, Europe‘s largest desert.","title":"Europe‘s Largest Desert","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2286622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Hughes","original_name":"Stephen Hughes","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/2keLwI4JBsVT6VY8nWhBJb5KCEQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"660ac7ed0b5fd6017c36b60a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377687,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Alvaro Mendoza","original_name":"Alvaro Mendoza","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631dbb9b0bb07600928675f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377687,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Alvaro Mendoza","original_name":"Alvaro Mendoza","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ac7d7cabfe401652f03c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627619,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Macarena Torres","original_name":"Macarena Torres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ac95bc8a5ac017c7866c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709515,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Foinquinos","original_name":"Eric Foinquinos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ac96ea0be28017d723a14","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377687,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Alvaro Mendoza","original_name":"Alvaro Mendoza","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ac8840b5fd60162362794","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377691,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pablo Valdivieso","original_name":"Pablo Valdivieso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ac94bae3843017d1dc8bf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francisco Moreno","original_name":"Francisco Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660ac991a0be28017d723a25","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627624,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"M.
