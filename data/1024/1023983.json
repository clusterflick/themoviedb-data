The fanciful story is set in an imaginary kingdom and all, naturally, ends well. However, despite the slight plot line L’Étoile is something of a pivotal work, a unique example of French 19th-century light opera, orchestrated with great sophistication and flooded with gossamer wit.","popularity":0.2999,"poster_path":"/1twoRiS8cV94li0myulB1y4UK2G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra
