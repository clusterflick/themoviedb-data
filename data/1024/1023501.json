Highly symbolic, it celebrates the beauty of the imagination and impossible dreams that come true, the effort that goes into them, the wait, the joy at last. It's a film about songs that is openly inspired by Werner Herzog's masterpiece Fitzcarraldo and revisits the choir \"Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares\", here in the form of a colorful troupe of dancers from Romagna.","popularity":0.1287,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La nave sul monte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabetta Sgarbi","original_name":"Elisabetta Sgarbi","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/c6asaW5f74uexZ6vZi7mtuDWTPx.jpg","credit_id":"631e94e89c24fc007a46609a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15310314","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
