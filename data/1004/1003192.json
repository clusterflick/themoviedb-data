This stunning production at Milan's La Scala unites four luminaries of today's opera scene to great effect: with his lilting legato, Marcelo Álvarez (Manrico) does justice to the opera's bel canto character; Franco Vassallo brings assurance and flair to the Count di Luna; Maria Agresta (Leonora) effortlessly rises to the challenges of the score; and Ekaterina Semenchuk (Azucena) also masters the most difficult notes. With the fastidious Daniele Rustioni leading La Scala's world-class orchestra, the music leads the action apace, resounding alongside the hall's legendary chorus and amid monumental sets and decor in this sublime production of one of the world's favorite operas.","popularity":0.1563,"poster_path":"/msIBYn4Ps0TtfQ1VLrbE6yP3MrX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Trovatore (La Scala)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Vassallo","original_name":"Franco Vassallo","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/xGdVi5bryDF6DkD1BArlmyq3vTF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Il Conte di Luna","credit_id":"62db34d0c439c00051b3a304","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Agresta","original_name":"Maria Agresta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/v4ho9ZVG5z1pEr6aRpHR9VW76Vx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leonora","credit_id":"62db34dc322b2b005f9549d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1567668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Semenchuk","original_name":"Ekaterina Semenchuk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/z7rTjbrJTfAvCjtZeo5RUYhqagv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Azucena","credit_id":"62db34e8e323f30054a9c9e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcelo Álvarez","original_name":"Marcelo Álvarez","popularity":0.1324,"profile_path":"/cs1e8vXhhAkH8ECq1FhpewriD9q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Manrico","credit_id":"62db34f65ca70400679bb899","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwangchul Youn","original_name":"Kwangchul Youn","popularity":0.1001,"profile_path":"/7RZfJCEh0zUq2TnyV6zr5eOzoSe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"62db34ff322b2b005f9549ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3634117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marzia Castellini","original_name":"Marzia Castellini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ines","credit_id":"62db350b61bac4004d6cf6e1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimiliano Chiarolla","original_name":"Massimiliano Chiarolla","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ruiz","credit_id":"62db3516c439c0004eb18722","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Panariello","original_name":"Ernesto Panariello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Un Vecchio Zingaro","credit_id":"62db35255ca704004c807e57","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3634119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Bellanca","original_name":"Giuseppe Bellanca","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Un messo","credit_id":"62db352fe9da690051327a77","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902924,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniele Rustioni","original_name":"Daniele Rustioni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62db354f61bac4005098a358","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo De Ana","original_name":"Hugo De Ana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62db35b25ca704004c807e71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1585,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/msIBYn4Ps0TtfQ1VLrbE6yP3MrX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1070}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Il trovatore - Trailer (Teatro alla Scala)","key":"iDP5Vc5qLWw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-26T10:04:37.000Z","id":"62db36a22866fa00c4ec5b3c"}]}}}
