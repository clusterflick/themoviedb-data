Mixed in are spinning planets, colorful light spheres, and a tricky teeter-totter--flashier segments for more sophisticated scientists in the making, up to around age 3. Beethoven, Strauss, and primal African beats liven up this loopy first lab assignment (what kind of baby video would this be without a classical soundtrack?), and a parents' guide full of useful teaching tips can be downloaded from the Internet.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"For children 3 months and up","title":"Newton in a Bottle: Physics for Kids!","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
