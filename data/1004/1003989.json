On a long rainy afternoon, employees Sam and Willie practise their steps for the finals of the ballroom dancing championship.  Hally arrives from school to hide out in his parents’ tea room. These two men have been unlikely best friends to Hally his whole life. But it is apartheid era South Africa: he’s Master Harold, and they are the boys.  Tony Award-winning playwright Athol Fugard’s semi-autobiographical and blistering masterwork explores the nature of friendship, and the ways people are capable of hurting even those they love.","popularity":0.3107,"poster_path":"/iwsiJeg6wSHnYaiayTjK1KNLdFY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National Theatre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Theatre Live: 'Master Harold’… and the boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hammed Animashaun","original_name":"Hammed Animashaun","popularity":0.5515,"profile_path":"/vYOmgYYQ5xb52PVJskiJJrtVpCk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Willie","credit_id":"62ddf11b58361b0054693423","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2430575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anson Boon","original_name":"Anson Boon","popularity":0.3269,"profile_path":"/nxrcq1SiFpvrMckcDq5SV3fwYvj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hally","credit_id":"62ddf124ea84c700674ae0c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1240427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucian Msamati","original_name":"Lucian Msamati","popularity":0.6349,"profile_path":"/vGPnCNjSL4JwVQ4yqh0XLK2GpXM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"62ddf135a44d09004b11d605","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501053,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rajha Shakiry","original_name":"Rajha Shakiry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ddf158e9da690e4e4f3135","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501053,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rajha Shakiry","original_name":"Rajha Shakiry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ddf15033a533051fb938ca","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1897657,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Paule Constable","original_name":"Paule Constable","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ddf1621dbc8800543dcf14","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Alexander Weise","original_name":"Roy Alexander Weise","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ddf14533a533051fb938be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3636443,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giles Thomas","original_name":"Giles Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ddf17f33a533051fb938f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":932,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iwsiJeg6wSHnYaiayTjK1KNLdFY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":621},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1442,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sWxZrVMdKsbpvdqh4oENYark8RO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246884,"name":"filmed theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
