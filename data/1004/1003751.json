The work is created from two basic compositional premises; pulse and feedback. The backbone of the composition is a stream of visual and sonic pulses, leaving its intervals to be explored and brought to life by a feedback generating a network, consisting of envelopes, gates, compressors, and masks. The intertwining layers provide the experience of an elaborate audiovisual time-space-continuum. Running almost entirely without input from the outside world, the system becomes a magnifier of its own rudimentary functions and algorithms.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/g9lALqNzPn4nWiWeP0LDwalLeM0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Semaphore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telcosystems","original_name":"Telcosystems","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dd4d5f5ca7040b2ad2484f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g9lALqNzPn4nWiWeP0LDwalLeM0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
