John Funn, a lonely Missing Persons detective at the frayed end of a once promising career, hitches his wagon to the rising star of a strange and impressionable young sergeant named Snookie. Computo, a World War II Army surplus robot, and Crazy Legs, an horrifically injured streetfighter, eke out a desperate living hawking mislabelled narcotics, while patiently awaiting happier times. Woven throughout the unraveling of these two dysfunctional partnerships is the story of a bizarre Missing Persons case involving a mysterious half-drowned man living one foot below the surface of the Atlantic ocean. A tale told in a cycle of interlocking absurdities--played almost alarmingly straight--MISSING PERSONS is an entirely CGI-generated 3D animated film, rendered in \"toon-style\" using custom software.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing Persons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan O'Donnell","original_name":"Dan O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62dce30b27d9cc0060ba76f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt O'Donnell","original_name":"Matt O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62dce31761bac400557ff033","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0365510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
