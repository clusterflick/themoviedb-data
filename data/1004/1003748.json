The generated visuals and sounds are presented on a widescreen projection and a 5.1 surround speaker system in a pitch dark space. Non-referential shapes and sounds with a clear and austere aesthetic are the starting point for the composition, which bases its rhythm and development on the actual date and time.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/fx0X06MS4mfOFXqzh1p1kKeEsqc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meta_Epics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telcosystems","original_name":"Telcosystems","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dd4b110d9f5a0067b79aaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fx0X06MS4mfOFXqzh1p1kKeEsqc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
