Children are playing, running around, laughing loud and enjoying their time. The sudden death of a pigeon is the start of a destruction to all these beauties. Time goes on and people get more and more cruel. An intimate warm space turns into a low quality, black and white world which reminds every spectator of a cheese game.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/5XxCFkMBlTyr1MprZoxY8l10m08.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2022-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gambit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naime Pakniyat","original_name":"Naime Pakniyat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62daedd969d280023bd030a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21349518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5XxCFkMBlTyr1MprZoxY8l10m08.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Linoleum International Contemporary Animation and Media Art Festival","release_date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
