This film gives an intimate and nuanced look into the adoption journey of the Curry family, making a case for their humanity. By exploring themes of alternative parenting, ambitious altruism, the power of family love, and the challenges of special needs adoption, it empowers and gives an honest voice to the adoptive parents who are rarely represented. In this time of increasing racial diversity and growth of the unconventional family, the Currys' story inspires us to introspect on social justice and making a difference in others' lives.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/qq79q6pgoCkqxBA88uRdie2eiCx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hayden & Her Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"May May Tchao","original_name":"May May Tchao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dadd26a3144000543ad216","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Craig J.
