Chan uses time-lapse to accentuate the transitory movement of light over the structures, highlighting their physical form within the altered landscape.\r Shifting from micro to macro, she investigates traces of human presence within the buildings, as well as the social and cultural shifts within the respective societies. The atmospheric soundtrack combines ambient field recordings including conversations, songs, traffic and natural sounds with old recordings of her grandmother's Hakka songs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/smNIxFuN0QvVzY9KffDSXsiWI9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interval II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suki Chan","original_name":"Suki Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dd59dfe9da690e50c42d04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/smNIxFuN0QvVzY9KffDSXsiWI9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
