Armed with a Ferguson Videostar camera they set out to record as much of the event as they could. While the BBC’s official footage amounts to only a few minutes for news broadcasts, James and Roger recorded several hours, and their material includes interviews with both Patrick Troughton and Tom Baker.  Some of this material has been used in other productions by both Reeltime Pictures and BBC Video, but the original tapes were thought to be lost forever – until rediscovered earlier this year. So now enjoy another chance to take a trip to Longleat in 1983. The sound may not be perfect and the pictures come from ageing VHS tapes – but the atmosphere is unmistakable. So avoid the queues, and get to the front of the line with a trip down memory lane!","popularity":0.6449,"poster_path":"/hla9WxEcm2nX5p9krl3bXU5NJWv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Longleat '83: The Lost Footage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2741692,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Russell","original_name":"James Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62dbe7472866fa00c4ecc277","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Davison","original_name":"Peter Davison","popularity":0.7297,"profile_path":"/v6VPbMj7iTrhE5sBo3g7hoRSofA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62dbe75185005d004e01adf6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Strickson","original_name":"Mark Strickson","popularity":0.2346,"profile_path":"/xqk0PxWC4d2nHyZcgZ13uu2l0Ae.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62dbe757c50ad200dc402202","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Briggs","original_name":"Nicholas Briggs","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/7QUxZVfw8WqUSxPVHrhmRtXGFUl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62dbe7705ca704004c80e05d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Franklin","original_name":"Richard Franklin","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":"/7kbqUiDjaoHdLE2epFu6pwrDXVR.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62dbe777ea84c7004cdb26f4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Leeson","original_name":"John Leeson","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/tmnsokNJvaXt6E5fvmTmcqoQJC5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62dbe77fe9da69042e43afe3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450011,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David J.
