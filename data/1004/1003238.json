From the \"Furrie\" phenomenon, to rabid pin collecting, to Disney theme park \"annual pass holders\" spending every day of their life at Disneyland, we see not only the driving force of fear behind the irrationality but also how a disillusioned generation brought up with the \"nuclear family\" ideals of the fifties is beginning to turn its back on a frightening, hostile world resembling nothing like the one promised in their youth, choosing instead to purchase a more kinder and magical facsimile from Disney at a much steeper price than they realize.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Dream Worlds Collide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1438286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
