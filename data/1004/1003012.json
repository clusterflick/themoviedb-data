In the story a newspaper editor sends his reporter to investigate the low-income housing shortage in Los Angeles. Visiting slums in central L.A., the reporter finds decaying dwellings, some without plumbing and heating. The film contrasts them with the sturdy preâ€“World War II city housing projects that continue to provide a healthy environment for their residents. And Ten Thousand More takes its title from the number of new housing units reportedly required by L.A. residents.  Note: The film was broadcast and screened at public meetings during the postwar public housing debate in L.A.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/waotaqEar0xyLvq2yn7XHj4udCR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1901,"logo_path":"/qYVzHQwrymunQoYPcTgbSQb3n2V.png","name":"University of Southern California","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Ten Thousand More","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chet Huntley","original_name":"Chet Huntley","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/dLVbiPPXInmM4WmQrLDnmAnqNXE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62daaca315dea000565056c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold C.
