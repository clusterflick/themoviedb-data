It is a memorial trace of childhood. Some fog, dead trees, dwellings, a few piano keys, abandoned boats. It is a dreamlike, fluid poem which contemplates a mental landscape and an absence within a tangible organic cycle. It is a proportionless sensory journey. It is a bitter-tasting portrait-in-time of an intoxicating beauty.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/21e8WLBsnsqWwMVcbRO8ooWGVdS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1985","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaetan Besnard","original_name":"Gaetan Besnard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dd44f127d9cc0060baa23f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/21e8WLBsnsqWwMVcbRO8ooWGVdS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
