This gave him the perfect excuse to eliminate several political enemies and tighten his grip on a tumultuous nation. This episode covers Napoleon's golden era - his rise to Emperor in 1804 and his remarkable military victories at Austerlitz, Eylau and Ulm. By 1808 the Emperor of France was just a short step away from becoming the Emperor of Europe.","popularity":0.0881,"poster_path":"/gEVg6G0M6gnZNkIKc0EZ0oUcjDV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleon: Imperial Zenith","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1681445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Whelan","original_name":"Robert Whelan","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62dbca1e2866fa00c6bcab2d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62dbca98dc1cb4004fab2868","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3634467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gavin Bott","original_name":"Gavin Bott","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbcab785005d005150f70d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3634466,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Eales","original_name":"Simon Eales","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbca5685005d00694ddc3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3634464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Malcolm Seymour","original_name":"Malcolm Seymour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbca6361bac400557f66d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3633447,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Audrey Healy","original_name":"Audrey Healy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbcac15ca704004fe9a1dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gormlie","original_name":"Chris Gormlie","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbcaddc50ad200db40f18b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gormlie","original_name":"Chris Gormlie","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbcae485005d005150f724","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Russell","original_name":"Gary Russell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dbcaa92866fa00c6bcab74","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/WryLszmiXxaZNdS02J0fSbR8WP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2200}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1008,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gEVg6G0M6gnZNkIKc0EZ0oUcjDV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
