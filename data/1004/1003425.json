He made himself even better known outside the art community as the signer in the July 22 trial. In this film, the creators have followed and observed Malling in the creation of the giant work of art «Norwegian muskox»: a drawing of a muskox. We follow every stroke of the canvas in a fascinating study of both the work of art and Malling as an artist, and the great detail work and focus one can have on a project over such a long period of time. The muskox is a slow animal and the film is a tribute to the slowness, which gives a pleasant and meditative pace to the film.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2DZgaoLjlbuLR2dyPAaOaLTdC6g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moskus - Fortelling om et bilde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2DZgaoLjlbuLR2dyPAaOaLTdC6g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
