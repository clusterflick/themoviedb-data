A child grows up in an uncertain world, while his father, camera in hand, tries to capture that moment and build a bridge to the future. Between fragments of life, reflections and farewells, the question arises: how to raise a child in a time marked by collapse? Far from the noise of the city, looking for another way to inhabit the world, the director receives a visit from his father, a man who once lived in cinema and now carries the fragility of the years. Between grandfather and grandson, the director discovers himself in transit: still a son, now a father. The skin is a portrait of love as a refuge, of memory as an anchor and of cinema as a witness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"La Piel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Olivera","original_name":"Javier Olivera","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/zcHoYwOxN6OLBu7VFeZsaxJrBPZ.jpg","credit_id":"680b92abd148a82b0d9d0c36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
