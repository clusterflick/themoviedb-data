It's 1991. On board his first ship, the Raúl Primero, he records what words can't explain. On dry land, his son, Adrián, has just been born. Thirty years later, Adrián embarks for the Gran Sol, guided by those old recordings that his father filmed between networks, storms and dawns. In the solitude of the boat, with the engine vibrating in the chest and the wind hitting the deck, he tries to understand the distance that separated them. Recording his own journey, between memories and movement, he finds a way to approach, as if filming he could tell his father what he never dared to pronounce.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fomos Ficando Sós","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
