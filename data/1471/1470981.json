The shooting of a community film serves as a pretext for the inhabitants of Lerga, the 'Cucos', to film themselves thinking about posterity. Songs to the Virgin of Uju√©, rituals of faith, aerobic exercises in synchrony, work in the field and crafts or the preparation of a meal collaboratively are combined in the present but are projected towards the future, when the image will be footprint, memory of a life in common. Between resilience and invention, cinema builds senses of community and belonging.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/b7As8SW4SEkYsjgd2rFHbxGoEYA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kukuaren Kanta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5397676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Los habitantes de Lerga","original_name":"Los habitantes de Lerga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680ca17ff75d6f4718377cd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5397676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Los habitantes de Lerga","original_name":"Los habitantes de Lerga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680ca27e5cefd19d1c859001","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2000744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ione Atenea","original_name":"Ione Atenea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h55d9uRKKIKBtT3IxzB7mHGoCKn.jpg","credit_id":"680ca2ae2b3959560d6e2e5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2000744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ione Atenea","original_name":"Ione Atenea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h55d9uRKKIKBtT3IxzB7mHGoCKn.jpg","credit_id":"680ca2c2f75d6f4718377db8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
