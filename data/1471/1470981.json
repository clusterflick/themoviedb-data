The shooting of a community film serves as a pretext for the inhabitants of Lerga, the 'Cucos', to film themselves thinking about posterity. Songs to the Virgin of Uju√©, rituals of faith, aerobic exercises in synchrony, work in the field and crafts or the preparation of a meal collaboratively are combined in the present but are projected towards the future, when the image will be footprint, memory of a life in common. Between resilience and invention, cinema builds senses of community and belonging.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kukuaren Kanta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
