They say that before a tree dies, he visits his family in dreams.  A film story \"found footage\", of found footage, which questions the limits of archival material. A piece created from images that document the history of Spanish colonization during 1926 and 1930 in Equatorial Guinea. The nitrate emulsions of the film are released from their original political function. And the traces of colonial Equatorial Guinea of 1926-1930 are recycled with poetic justice, far from extractivist logics. Decipher the enigma of the \"other\", of the absolutely different.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mtOU4rNXqr4nhUwVSJVFVv5VUd8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maldito ni침o","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Violeta Pag치n","original_name":"Violeta Pag치n","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680b31c9f3cf6d66d79d47f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1449,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/mtOU4rNXqr4nhUwVSJVFVv5VUd8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":966}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
