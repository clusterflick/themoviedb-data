Now, I have an artsy audience, made in New York, exchanging their creative works with your local storyteller. That’s why subtitles are a must.  Among the sonic contributions, the whistles—those gentle breaths of life—belong to Juan Alberto Cristobal Paredes, my father. I’ve always wanted to use his whistle in a video.  This project also stems from a deep desire to connect with those who are just beginning their artistic journey. While I’ve done this through interviews before, this time, I do it through a more personal piece.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VIDEO ARTE 2020","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3141049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jimy Cristóbal","original_name":"Jimy Cristóbal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gKB51KYEmi2YEPxfGq1bNoOi8TH.jpg","credit_id":"680ace0115a1d5a614ab4326","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
