Miserable at the convention, Tom's luck turns around when he meets April, a bartender at the hotel lobby bar. She convinces him to leave the convention and they find themselves exploring Charlotte. The two spend the day in and out of museums, parks, and pubs. Aided by April's free spirit, Tom is able to take a closer look at himself and the choices he's made to get him where he is. His passions, fears, and outlook are all exposed by April. The question is, will he do anything about it?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8G6idUXrUmcb2bQZZ0kEaYQWQL8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Tom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1771527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candace Blanchard","original_name":"Candace Blanchard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6790P0V3kZNLff6XFrLdiBL4wM2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mindy","credit_id":"680bff4063c5f9522989fa76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Cardell","original_name":"Jay Cardell","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Abe","credit_id":"680bff7663c5f9522989fa95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Moore","original_name":"Nathan Moore","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/1RIJNnfh621hCZQ44OiNJZLS2Ak.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"680bffa7f3cf6d66d79d8115","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2149020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Holt","original_name":"Tim Holt","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Craigster","credit_id":"680bffbcf3cf6d66d79d812c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053414,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Simpson","original_name":"Christian Simpson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tuUjQUmfGgfjtswof91im64LzTQ.jpg","credit_id":"680c0031271ecb3ae08a9b8d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Moore","original_name":"Nathan Moore","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/1RIJNnfh621hCZQ44OiNJZLS2Ak.jpg","credit_id":"680c005763c5f9522989fb14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1674424,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tara DiPetrillo","original_name":"Tara DiPetrillo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/nK9e9Nlwm38rmDxODSNzTCs7c5y.jpg","credit_id":"680c00ed8bcea66a86ab0ea8","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3293888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":2651,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8G6idUXrUmcb2bQZZ0kEaYQWQL8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
