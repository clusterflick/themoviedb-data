Through celluloid portraits, interviews, WhatsApp audios and the rhythmic beating of fans in the heat, their voices claim labor rights and the recognition of an essential and invisible work. Those hands that clean, iron, and that, although they hurt, provide care, become a symbol of resistance and dignity. Between seriousness and play, between work and rest, this essay celebrates the collective wisdom of those who sustain life and demand justice with joy, patience and determination.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xU2TL5lCNdv0YJgzjsKcv8DLMBN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las territorias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
