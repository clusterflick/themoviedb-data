Shooting took place in a remote area in Iceland with a computer-controlled 16 mm camera that exposed one frame every three minutes. As a result, some three months were compressed into 23 minutes. An affinity to structural film of the 1960s and 1970s is evident, particularly to British landscape films. However, in spite of the undeniable interest shown in topographic conditions of light, shade, weather and the color and texture of the landscape, Sackl does not permit us to succumb to the fascination of natu-ral phenomena. This landscape is intruded upon by human bodies and various objects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Open","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Sackl","original_name":"Albert Sackl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a45e2778b4626739d0b6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lincoln - TIE International Cinema Exposition","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
