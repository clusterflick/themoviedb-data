In September 2016, the Turkish President appointed trustees to replace elected officials in pro-Kurdish municipalities, stripping away the power of local governance. Despite this, the participants are devoted to preserving Kurdish culture through land, body, food, and music. As their stories unfold, epic encounters between good and evil emerge on a dramatic stage.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ouPe8ypjjyHSiksOKRdQ8NytVQY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against Forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5394064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azad Azizyan","original_name":"Azad Azizyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680a836fbfbdf1f8c589b180","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35052074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ouPe8ypjjyHSiksOKRdQ8NytVQY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2.
