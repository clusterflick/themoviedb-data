Performers and real-life husband and wife Micky & Philip Bottenberg play Mia and Carlo, a recently separated couple who are meeting in their empty apartment for the last time to finish painting over the traces of their old life together.  This is a realistic short film that shows sometimes there is no need for words, just unrestrained passionate sex between two people who don't know if this will be their last time together.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mJhRDIgxLBf1XHWL2wSMsGs1tBO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Remember?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mJhRDIgxLBf1XHWL2wSMsGs1tBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
