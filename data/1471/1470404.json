During filming on the streets of Barcelona, Ricardo was filming in Super-8 while Oscar was driving a convertible. The interiors, recorded in the studio of photographer Oriol Maspons, show Serena and Beatriz dancing. It is a modest but casual walk in which the sinuous shapes of the facades of the Barcelona of Cerd√† are presented in relation to the female body. A dialogue is established between the modernist tradition, the symbols of pop culture and the powerful visual language of the Archigram group.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagen de la ciudad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162780,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oscar Tusquets","original_name":"Oscar Tusquets","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680b3391e92f940ca69d3a32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Bofill","original_name":"Ricardo Bofill","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/fwtMobOjBjpBPJUx2N7upVEDMm8.jpg","credit_id":"680b3432e92f940ca69d3a58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
