Her journey is not just one of physical healing but also a powerful exploration of body acceptance and resilience.  Through a blend of self-shot footage, animation, and archival clips, the film brings humour and heart to the sensitive topic of breast cancer recovery. Joanna’s imaginative outlook shines through as she revisits her treatment, reconnects with family, and meets other survivors to share stories. Along the way, she faces the emotional toll of illness, navigates her own transformation, and demonstrates the power of creativity as a tool for survival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye Breasts!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
