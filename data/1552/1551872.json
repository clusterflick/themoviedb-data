Tata Posadas, like the rest of her fellow vendors, only wants to still be able to preserve that history and culture. However, the place with such distinct culture through their food, which locals and tourists loved and always look forward to, is at risk with a redevelopment plan from a private company that involves changes that could completely erase what made Manokan Country the way it was. The redevelopment promises that it will help the Manokan Country progress by being bigger and better, a promise that is still being held on to today: in which some vendors are hesitant as they ought to preserve the unique ambience of the Manokan Country.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pagtipig","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5709582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tata Posadas","original_name":"Tata Posadas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68d48472735740e45991391b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5709583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hon.
