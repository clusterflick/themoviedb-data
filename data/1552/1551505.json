The film unfolds like a passage along the Nile, through dreamlike currents of Cairo where memory and presence blur, part vision, part yearning, part possibility. Upon its waters, a fragile utopia awakens, a world where exile never arrived, where return is still within reach, and the home once lost flows back into reach.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/h2u1xWFZn4FTn6LFXJSUEHPxBD2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UNTIL WE RETURN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5708770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Huss Al-Chokhdar","original_name":"Huss Al-Chokhdar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d3ea686a1d924dbc2ec42d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2u1xWFZn4FTn6LFXJSUEHPxBD2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
