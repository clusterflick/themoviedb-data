Through distorted visuals and fragmented rhythms, it explores the blurred line between physical confinement and mental unraveling. As the shelter becomes a pressure chamber of the soul, hallucinations and inner fears begin to seep through the cracks. The film is less a narrative than a sensory experience â€” a descent into the emotional and perceptual dissonance of isolation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tJeCkLrc1HVO4N7i3oUoXxWOIRq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bunker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5266591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samira Alizadehghanad","original_name":"Samira Alizadehghanad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2f814c9beb2ffcbd4265e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/tJeCkLrc1HVO4N7i3oUoXxWOIRq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
