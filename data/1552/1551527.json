Diagnosed with a case of acute depression, Sheila was sent to a psychiatric hospital for four months to treat her mental illness. Now out of the hospital, Sheila feels like her old self and doesn't want anyone to treat her with kid gloves. But those closest to Sheila, including her fianc√© and his parents, her parents, her best friend, her neighbors and her coworkers all talk about how they treat her in relation to how they really feel about her. Some believe that Sheila is never to be trusted again, others want to be close to the \"old\" Sheila but now feel uncomfortable around her, and others don't believe there anything wrong with her but don't want to be associated with the predominant notion of her being not well. With so many obstacles all of which Sheila is fully aware, she may never get a fair chance in life unless people openly come to her defense.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stigma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2891938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanley Jackson","original_name":"Stanley Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d3facabc958fb60349f5b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
