She attempts to ignore the buzzing courtroom lights, the constant eye-contact from the jury and tries to manage her own distressing emotions recalling the event – all the while navigating the confusing questions from the legal staff, who don’t seem to be able to understand her situation or enable her to be helpful. Until… A narrative story entirely set in one court room over the course of the witness statement, intercutting with a visualisation of what’s going on in the autistic protagonist’s mind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"A Witness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1590758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Carey","original_name":"Emily Carey","popularity":0.8548,"profile_path":"/tWUHikgtPCAPgYVrReXAPjMYNAW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68d3c0c571c235bf376d515c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Small","original_name":"Sharon Small","popularity":1.8644,"profile_path":"/yRlVnUrp7yDJet6UGsugQ7EblhD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68d3c0d6bc55c0bba82ec3ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2695374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Peters","original_name":"Jordan Peters","popularity":0.224,"profile_path":"/e0MIcachX8qy0NNnmUXgTAm78Ly.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68d3c0e6e169c92708840159","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Ludwig","original_name":"Linda Ludwig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d3c0975198d096b249f4ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Curle","original_name":"James Curle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d3c0b069b34b33cc6d51dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34634711","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Norwich Film Festival","release_date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
