By the early 1960â€™s The Jackson dropped its curtains for good. Few photographs or other historical documents existed to help preserve and tell the story of the Jackson during its heyday.  At the heel of a decade long project to restore and reopen the Jackson, a group of life long residents, nearly all octogenarians, share their most memorable time visiting the Jackson when they were young. Nearly 60+ years later, on the heal of the grand reopening, the history of this small town theatre comes to life - told by those who where there.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jackson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Davis","original_name":"Donald Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2c4ece9849342eb7a5055","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Clumbley","original_name":"Amber Clumbley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2c5018ec1c32f4497e59c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Wolfe","original_name":"Kelly Wolfe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2c50fb177a60674749704","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Causey","original_name":"Virginia Causey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2c520ddf045e02b97e412","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angel Verde","original_name":"Angel Verde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2c3fca1a3d96f8fac906f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angel Verde","original_name":"Angel Verde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2c48c2a5e7c0a45cecf69","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angel Verde","original_name":"Angel Verde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2c4a56d6b12cb857a518a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angel Verde","original_name":"Angel Verde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2c4b1b9737cbd25cc41b0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angel Verde","original_name":"Angel Verde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2c4c019a93df4e37a51e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38489451","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Nashville Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
