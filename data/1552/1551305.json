They dig into lost metaphors that seem to have been missing and explore the ways of storytelling in the face of the current climate. Rather than seeking definitive answers, they encounter a collective process towards an open dialogue, and a vital force: enthusiasm. It is that moving force that remains portrayed as an attempt of passing it on to  those who need a reminder of why, making films is still worth it.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/sMywIcA9Ot4CU2u43OBBwbNYyDS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"A guide to spreading enthusiasm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seby Lepeiú","original_name":"Seby Lepeiú","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Payaso 1","credit_id":"68d32c040743f6b8d7334703","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabo Agüero","original_name":"Gabo Agüero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Payaso 2","credit_id":"68d32c1c7d69e48fd0dd0b4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Linares","original_name":"Francisco Linares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrador (Voz)","credit_id":"68d32c3a25f294b8fe6d2d8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pilar Gomez","original_name":"Pilar Gomez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narradora (Voz)","credit_id":"68d32c614804b036db43019d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agustina Balmaceda","original_name":"Agustina Balmaceda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32ae18a6296590a4301ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Sanchez","original_name":"Tomás Sanchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32b00c8852713a4dd0b56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087940,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Camila Pellicena Rome","original_name":"Camila Pellicena Rome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32b12708480cb2c8d2a57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5658559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Livellara Laplace","original_name":"Juan Livellara Laplace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32b3d18df64375c6d2d5e","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Thourte","original_name":"Victoria Thourte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32b6c70749a7dc243019c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707830,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Agustina Maia Casullo","original_name":"Agustina Maia Casullo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32b7d170107995f62b100","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4629228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cielo Iturralde Carrera","original_name":"Maria Cielo Iturralde Carrera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32b9717a02aaa2a62b114","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087930,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alejo Passaro","original_name":"Alejo Passaro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32bb731344eee8cdfe764","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agustina Balmaceda","original_name":"Agustina Balmaceda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32cb6a5000318e262b0f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Sanchez","original_name":"Tomás Sanchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32cd919e381d31743018e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707842,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabella Mazzoncini","original_name":"Isabella Mazzoncini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32ceaf4073976bd334735","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4839425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Candela Roca","original_name":"Candela Roca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32cfadb2813f7e63346fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/sMywIcA9Ot4CU2u43OBBwbNYyDS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
