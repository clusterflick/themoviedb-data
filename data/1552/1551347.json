The couple is at the twilight of their decline; the boiling point is near but doesn't take hold. Deep down, it's comfort that keeps them sober and silent. Comfort provided by a cocoon, an interior that reassures them, that doubly encloses them. They need to talk, hope to see emotional changes, but the silence has lasted for a long time now. We notice that in every room, even if inside they seem distant, they are together, continuing to live in synergy. With the exception of one. In the bathroom, the man finds himself alone. Why is it when the other is no longer there that we finally say what we think? This is what happens to the man, he ruminates. But holding back for so long only leads to harmful thoughts, and he can't help but imagine his decline from now on.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":300,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why is it only when the other person is no longer there that we finally say what we think?","title":"Will we get through the winter?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Will we get through the winter?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flore Lallau","original_name":"Flore Lallau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"68d351af997fa371b20e39f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5708031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geanni Petrisor","original_name":"Geanni Petrisor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Man","credit_id":"68d351e186ed184ce149f31d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100548,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Melle","original_name":"Lucas Melle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d352030286fe564d1f8b4a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5708035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milan De Cet","original_name":"Milan De Cet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d35225b89e07b9870e3a23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5708037,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Dege","original_name":"Louis Dege","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d3523f08677ae1fa2ec2ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@milandct","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
