This is the story of the heroic cat rescuers who have devoted their lives to finding and returning the cats to their families who had lost everything. One year later, a monster known as the Camp Fire wiped out Paradise. Four times the devastation of the Santa Rosa fire, the rescuers packed up and dove right in. While they were now more seasoned, fiercely dedicated-and more complicated-an antagonist appeared in the aftermath of the Camp Fire that no one had planned on.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mT5n6s7qk35hPu1Zcf6wbVsW5yT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":275320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ravenshoe Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fire Cats: Save Something Small","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Craig","original_name":"Philip Craig","popularity":0.6192,"profile_path":"/kG9GSLHvquQtYY3hirawO6MiRPI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"68d47f5f54cabccecc4a91af","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5709572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharine Parsons","original_name":"Katharine Parsons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d47f1374caf351ca93632d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5709572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharine Parsons","original_name":"Katharine Parsons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d47f2b29cbc88b2a22848b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5709573,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Thron","original_name":"Douglas Thron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d47f4311ed6f9d1a22848c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9032398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cDaB50MvoOkPU9EoVKe244ldWyf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mT5n6s7qk35hPu1Zcf6wbVsW5yT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Julien Dubuque International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE FIRE CATS â€”Save Something Small TRAILER","key":"ypQbctHerwg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-06T19:04:33.000Z","id":"68d47fee7ca9447d0bdfd0b5"}]}}}
