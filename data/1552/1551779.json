Little by little, the sea has swallowed its homes, its streets, and its memories. As the community prepares to be relocated inland, a family holds onto the fragile beauty of what remains, celebrating birthdays, fishing together, walking the shoreline one last time. Between what was and what’s left, they face the impossible task of letting go. Filmed on the edge of absence, La Mar is a meditation on memory, loss, and the quiet strength of those who continue to live while everything around them slips away.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ozp5w6EEsYcUk6fl2XZrt6nupaE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Mar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Chapiro","original_name":"Jean Chapiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d45ab8b689e2aac022842e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4695141,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jessica Arzate","original_name":"Jessica Arzate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d45aca8907871adde74aa0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3621534,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kenia Carreón","original_name":"Kenia Carreón","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d45adde985a7908b91e8ab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1566,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ozp5w6EEsYcUk6fl2XZrt6nupaE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1058}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
