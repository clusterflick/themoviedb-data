But what does Joan Get? A naïve and inexperienced Angel sits in a sterile room awaiting judgement for having failed to bear witness to a young farm girl called Joan receive divine instruction. Switching between the black and white world of an angelic HR interrogation and the French country side The Angel looks to her interrogators in the hopes of finding meaning and justification for why Joan, having followed her instructions is destined to be burnt as a witch and heretic. Inspired by the painting ‘Joan of Arc’ by Jules Bastien Le Page the question at the heart of this film is not whether we drowned or burnt Witches. Rather why the violence and murder of women and all who identify as women is such a consistent and unrelenting thread throughout history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"They Burn Witches, Don’t They?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5453387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Izyan Hay","original_name":"Izyan Hay","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/wjJe29I4nMzfRbtd75KY21pYjN8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2b893e99679837c7a52f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Clarence","original_name":"Carolina Clarence","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2b8a61890269e05ac8c29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finn O’Riordain","original_name":"Finn O’Riordain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2b8c04a6be65bbccd8225","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1861345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Ellerby","original_name":"Sophie Ellerby","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/zLKVtIKfNAU3xDtwwCfjrw9RHWm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68d2b8d01c2974ee42d4237f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hester Bloom","original_name":"Hester Bloom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2b86f8ec1c32f4497e555","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5706763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hester Bloom","original_name":"Hester Bloom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d2b87cdb4c421484d422f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Norwich Film Festival","release_date":"2025-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
