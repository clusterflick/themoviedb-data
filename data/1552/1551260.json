Set in the gritty aftermath of a global pandemic that has decimated the population, this short film explores themes of loss, survival, purpose, and the struggle to overcome a painful past. Created as a fundraising tool, the proof of concept supports the development of the feature-length adaptation of America Down, based on the web series of the same name. Designed to demonstrate the production team's capabilities on a limited budget, the short emphasizes the tone, visual style, and narrative scope of the larger project - offering a powerful glimpse into a devastated America through the eyes of its young protagonist.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/o3RbkZirgOh3P9Cq7BTAUYdo17X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":275207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Last One Standing Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"America Down: The Proof of Concept","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4434183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Harmon","original_name":"Lucas Harmon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hkk6d1ONa5xjyZT04ZN2ZCVtCvV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jamie Davenport","credit_id":"68d31ad7b722df240dfea499","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Grace Schuman","original_name":"Ella Grace Schuman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Brinley","credit_id":"68d31ae863370bc3d1ac8ed2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Miles Johnston","original_name":"Jake Miles Johnston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Liam Davenport","credit_id":"68d31af81fe1eea1cececf96","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Brockmeyer","original_name":"Jeff Brockmeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Daryl / Dead Body","credit_id":"68d31b0b63370bc3d1ac8ee2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ty Leech","original_name":"Ty Leech","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cultist","credit_id":"68d31b1a4a6be65bbccd83c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Baranksi","original_name":"Jamie Baranksi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cultist","credit_id":"68d31b2f844a1f0e1efea3be","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5707645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.J.
