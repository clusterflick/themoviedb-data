In Paweł Kędzierski's film, perversely entitled Children's Day, we accompany them from a difficult morning wake-up call to going to bed in the evening. Although childhood is seen as a time of fun and carefree, Kędzierski's camera closely observes the full lives of the boys who take part in rehearsals for the absurd school play, learn by heart boring poems and help with everyday shopping. In the background, and sometimes in the foreground, the reality of the communist Poland.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children's Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Kędzierski","original_name":"Paweł Kędzierski","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/5qTzXi4yKgsveAGmaXLhG8ST4v6.jpg","credit_id":"68d46951e65139b8b191e8ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1074955","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
