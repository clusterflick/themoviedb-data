Mathematically Alive explores why Sports are such an integral part of American culture. What the affects are of following a team and, more importantly, why fans continue to invest so much emotion, time, and money into their team. They are the stories of any fan in America. For some it's an escape from reality, for others it forms their identity. Their fanaticism, not too far off from your own or someone you know, makes for a fascinating window into an often unexamined part of everyday life - Sport fandom.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Faces in the Crowd Take Center Stage","title":"Mathematically Alive: A Story of Fandom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1169152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
