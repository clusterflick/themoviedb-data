But when his friend fails to return, Amos discovers he has been deliberately trapped in a bizarre time loop. In a desperate attempt to escape \"yesterday\", Amos coaxes his ex-wife onto the island, but instead strands them both there. To ensure their own freedom, the two must scheme to invite their most dislikeable friends to the island, with unforeseen and messy consequences.
