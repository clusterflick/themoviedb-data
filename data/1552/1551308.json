One summer night, while stargazing with her childhood friend Goro and little sister Non-chan, they meet Kazuo, a mysterious young man in uniform who seems oddly familiar. After inhaling a lavender-scented mixture in a lab accident, Kazuko gains psychic powers, enabling her to time leap. Her strange experiences lead her closer to a shocking truth—Kazuo is a time traveller from the 27th century. He warns her that hearing the sound of something breaking triggers her time travel, but leaping into the past or future more than a day could bring dire consequences. A feisty Kazuko never bothers; she makes use of her abilities to help those around her until the ultimate price is paid. Her relentless kindness costs her the one person she loves most: her little sister, Non-chan.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5yhwtM87mSQJ9jX3ArrPLThkgxv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3341,"logo_path":"/dTG5dXE1kU2mpmL9BNnraffckLU.png","name":"Fuji Television Network","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":554498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Minamino","original_name":"南野陽子","popularity":1.2459,"profile_path":"/iJzJ6Rq68B6YrvmrToctnxbPaEb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kazuko Yoshiyama","credit_id":"68d32bdc4385f3958633470b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaru Takahashi","original_name":"Masaru Takahashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d32c31164c3709dadd0b36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38390437","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1248,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/5yhwtM87mSQJ9jX3ArrPLThkgxv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":821},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":752,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/npNLf3K5pUH3kLftCDJQ8qpMSdv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1985-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
