KISSINGER: The Journey to China","overview":"Richard Nixon was the first American President to visit the People's Republic of China.  His peacemaking visit opened the door to a country that he realized was destined to be one of the world's most important economic and military superpowers.  Henry Kissinger was President Nixon's National Security Advisor, later Secretary of State, and his indispensable partner in framing the mission to China.  In this fascinating address, given February 17, 1997 on the 25th Anniversary, to the hour and the day, of their departure from Washington, Dr. Kissinger speaks with great insight on how this historic initiative, and the resulting Shanghai Communique, still guides U.S. policy in Asia.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eEOHliQma6YgHVljlkIMR4IBDzL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":275325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nixon Library","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"President Nixon's Historic Journey to China · NIXON LIBRARY & NIXON CENTER · American Leadership Video Series","title":"HENRY A.
