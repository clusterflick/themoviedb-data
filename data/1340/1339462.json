But there's something wrong with that last catch. What the catcher doesn't know: the kidnapped boy is a vampire. And he's not the only one men get in trouble with - because there's also \"Popsy\". And he doesn't like that his boy was kidnapped.","popularity":0.2737,"poster_path":"/yepw5G4PFTYU5Obj4S40gk42qUf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Popsy Produktion
