In 1840, a few years after the Portuguese Civil War, a young man arrived at a village by the Douro, carrying a book full of stories. Following the teachings of that book, the villagers of Granja do Tedo founded a social and religious movement that would last seven years, led by the healer Maria das Neves, self-styled “Third Eve, by Jesus Crowned”. The promotion of women’s role in society, the divulgation of naturism, solidarity with the poor and the expansion of free education were some of the movement’s demands. Maria Coroada, Crowned Maria, tells us of the ability to converse with the gods that live inside of us, of the courageous search for voices that transcend us. It also tells us of a book’s power to transform a whole community. And of the beauty of that transformation.","popularity":0.4002,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8683,"logo_path":"/tLgfcgUC96znl4rzt8gaUCRruY1.png","name":"Cinemate","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowned Maria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Chambel","original_name":"Carla Chambel","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/vubI5HDAuL2DlTpkT0KOMV0tB2f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maria Coroada","credit_id":"66ce232f77e0fbd4419ff788","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleia Almeida","original_name":"Cleia Almeida","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/kEQvzzEeeM9zJVD3jRIuuLpKCPm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Antónia","credit_id":"66ce234053556e38d056bed0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Barata Belo","original_name":"Sandra Barata Belo","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/vN4Hu83sarXvVtEWjPWWUaYF93z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cristina 1840","credit_id":"66ce23501b5d693296c57cfd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oceana Basílio","original_name":"Oceana Basílio","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/ene4VVjNU4W6MBX39jSPlh3qxeP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cristina 2012","credit_id":"66ce235f7cd9f8ff0e81ad34","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Carriço","original_name":"Ricardo Carriço","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/u4Z9JwDDwmvxktJjSlZeCnXhmDf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"José","credit_id":"66ce236c639f5fcd1f63a695","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":647347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diogo Morgado","original_name":"Diogo Morgado","popularity":1.3221,"profile_path":"/KsnfgusybjgPfxGnwokID6Dqu5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Basílio","credit_id":"66ce23a6ff229ead7e22b174","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Salgado","original_name":"Sara Salgado","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":"/dD6ocZy9wlqqtEf4GR7le4T3Vqc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Felícia","credit_id":"66ce23b47fd2e306ee470bfe","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Monteiro","original_name":"Miguel Monteiro","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/5TUnHU8PxOUJ0U3aT132PWQ6feC.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Padre","credit_id":"66ce2c3370ce85bf1d63a734","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Coelho da Silva","original_name":"Carlos Coelho da Silva","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ce2310eae19343009ff706","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Coelho da Silva","original_name":"Carlos Coelho da Silva","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ce23195e29169a5556be29","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerardo Fernandes","original_name":"Gerardo Fernandes","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ce24188706bc6a5697d1ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2325402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
