Artur spent time in the city of Lod (Lydda) where a wall has been built that divides the Jewish Israeli neighbourhood from the Israeli Arabic neighbourhood. Zmijewski attempts to invite both sides together to do an exercise but finds that only two neighbours show up from the Jewish neighbourhood. The asymmetry makes the exercise impossible and what results is a heated yelling match which mirrors the stereotypical and canonical arguments on the surface of Israeli society.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1797173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artur Żmijewski","original_name":"Artur Żmijewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n4n3dL7nhigCa7csEC79jORaoGO.jpg","credit_id":"66cc8c89366688c8483d2bc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
