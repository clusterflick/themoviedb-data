Isabella Rossellini, from whom Patty rents her land tells us, \"Patty is the Picasso of vegetables!\" The documentary upends the romance of farm-to-table â€“ buying fresh produce directly from farmers markets and at farm stands is wonderful, but the farmer's life is a constant struggle. We watch Patty work her butt off (with her small, mostly female team) seven days a week, growing the vegetables her top chef clients treasure. Patty's passion is to constantly improve her soil, increase her yield of organic vegetables, and just as urgently scramble to stay afloat.","popularity":0.2405,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soul of a Farmer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Rossellini","original_name":"Isabella Rossellini","popularity":2.4103,"profile_path":"/z0zojT6nwDxi35HMcXlVpBfuBAU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ce03698d415171c8c57bf8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2248532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Missy Robbins","original_name":"Missy Robbins","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/fja6fIgV2tPNjs0gDZ7mUjoPhAh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ce038764e5770797bd181c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Lo","original_name":"Anita Lo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ce03c613455cddfac425a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3769901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Sohyi","original_name":"Kim Sohyi","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ce041119f6fb629b682329","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Sherman","original_name":"Roger Sherman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1c8c340190671b1b1550c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
