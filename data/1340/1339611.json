It was the power of family - his wife, child, and uncle - that led this good-for-nothing to start a new life. Kaneko now runs a commissary that provides items to people imprisoned like he once was and visits them on behalf of their families. However, the peace is shattered when a young girl, his son’s friend, is found dead.","popularity":0.2606,"poster_path":"/56iBJAW3aUbK7vXJM8YqtSOfUC8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2073,"logo_path":"/tWxRSaKmRJNTcmtlXsmn5R4KOSU.png","name":"KADOKAWA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":142186,"logo_path":"/bdXTOuU7PdsDtQngyM7vb47zePs.png","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":202952,"logo_path":"/1lkaaSq1FCx1KtnFuGcAYV7zHRy.png","name":"REMOW","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":257031,"logo_path":"/tR4h6OYTRjoMYNr0ipBfnNzGjj1.png","name":"stormpictures","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":249883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Happinet Media Marketing","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2024-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaneko's Commissary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryuhei Maruyama","original_name":"丸山隆平","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/8h5XypjU5QOwACO5AO8RpFjcSGc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66cddfad5736afbfb19db1eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Maki","original_name":"真木よう子","popularity":1.3692,"profile_path":"/romJ40cSGxem3D07twR4gH4a6h4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66e4b50f4716c941b5ee6ca4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kira Miura","original_name":"三浦綺羅","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/9HTGb2eSw9ZqDmtuWFwflrHFaJL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66e4b5194716c941b5ee6caa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akira Terao","original_name":"寺尾聰","popularity":0.4587,"profile_path":"/6Q6AoPCEbGzC8cmLZC7yZRXgk1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66e4b59546dec56c4e3aceff","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Go Furukawa","original_name":"Go Furukawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cde03e0fe621cfe89aab8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4003561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Go Furukawa","original_name":"Go Furukawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cde0486adb2bd13fb34829","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092920,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomoo Ezaki","original_name":"江崎朋生","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e4b5a660735e990d3accb4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33290681","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3J33UZS3JGt2DZpZKpqOEyauBc9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2113,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/56iBJAW3aUbK7vXJM8YqtSOfUC8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
