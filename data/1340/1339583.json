Where the downs descend to the sea there are craggy headlands, sweeping bays and magnificent beaches. There is always plenty to see and the railway travels right through the heart of it all. Our journey will take us from Weymouth in Dorset, across Hampshire and then down to the Isle of Wight. We begin in the popular seaside town of Weymouth by sampling some of the many delights it has to offer. We then head to the historical town of Dorchester before turning east towards Bournemouth via Wool, Wareham Corfe Castle, Swanage and Poole. Bournemouth is the largest holiday resort on the south coast, and we take a look at some of the reasons why it reamins so popular. From Bournemouth we travel to Christchurch, Brockenhurst, Beaulieu, Lymington and across to Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/dakl4LXaYAxTnxTlUhaFjiuufZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Demand Media Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"British Railway Journeys: Weymouth to the Isle of Wight","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Symes","original_name":"Robert Symes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66cdcd6791b04dd50cb34661","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406469,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew Skelhorn","original_name":"Andrew Skelhorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cdcd81f4a8f90237c57a89","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dakl4LXaYAxTnxTlUhaFjiuufZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
