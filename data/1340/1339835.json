This \"linguistic thriller\" force-feeds the viewer a non-verbal banquet they won't soon forget, giving new meaning to \"reading between the lines\". Naomi is a woman with a calling. A calling to deliver divine vengeance. Disgusted by the irreparable hideousness of the people that surround her, she sets out on a mission to correct it in the only way she knows how, even if it costs her her soul. But maybe beauty ain't worth all that.","popularity":0.066,"poster_path":"/vLyqUL50Uo5Ak7k8s29Py4sTbK7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post
