As their deranged General pushes the ill-equipped survivors on a manic hunt for 'the enemy', Henri Fabergé must face the absurdity of his own mortality, experiencing the loss of his friends, of his moral compass, and of his own mind. A disturbing examination of war, power, friendship and honour, the film's tone pivots from dark comedy to a metaphysical dream as our anti-hero is made to realize that the enemy is never what it seems.","popularity":0.4854,"poster_path":"/fgJ0ig2XPBbvI5OrHufa7E3Ildn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
