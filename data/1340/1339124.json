He can take no more, and knives his rival in a fight.  But his troubles are just beginning.  His girlfriend is not coming back.  The police are after him, as are the other members of the gang.  Everywhere he is a fugitive.  He suffers a breakdown, and fantasises that the doctors in the hospital are killing his injured rival, and that he will be blamed.  He steals a bottle of serum that a doctor had used for an injection, hoping to convince his former friends that he is innocent, but it is just an empty bottle which will convince no-one.  He finds himself cornered in a dark lane where there is no way out.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ubaB46lFHcEvK4Iin0QMvXBQTxr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fugitive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Easton","original_name":"Donald Easton","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Fugitive","credit_id":"66cc868e5ba48b084b6eb06d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4905203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Baxter","original_name":"Caroline Baxter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"66cc86986816ec5dfc0ec9ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Andrews","original_name":"Nigel Andrews","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rival","credit_id":"66cc86a787d0e713456eb139","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96233,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Wynne-Simmons","original_name":"Robert Wynne-Simmons","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc8678cd1a3dd2653ed955","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96233,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Wynne-Simmons","original_name":"Robert Wynne-Simmons","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cc8654570df6ca39caf492","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ubaB46lFHcEvK4Iin0QMvXBQTxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
