He suffers from a real condition called: Cognitive Dissonance. Right feels wrong. Bad feels good. Problem is, Darius sustains this at the weapons- grade level. After being discovered as a child, he's been in a secret government holding facility for special humans such as himself. Well someone left the door open and Darius and all his fucked up friends are out on the streets.
