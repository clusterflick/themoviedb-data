It also reveals the diverse and competing ideologies that coalesced on Jan. 6: angry Trump voters marched alongside sovereign citizens, Three Percenters, Proud Boys, and Christian Nationalists. Some rioters demonstrated solidarity with the police as others brutally assaulted officers.\"","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/4M01S3ZiZK4BDpAbQ5r3hxPrY5B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200381,"logo_path":"/1OAjprr0LoAWXC5WS6favtDTohg.png","name":"VICE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Stitched Together All the Footage from the Capitol Riot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4M01S3ZiZK4BDpAbQ5r3hxPrY5B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
