Ağa not only did not have a son, but also lost his wife at a young age. He raised his daughter Emine as a baby so that she would not feel orphaned. However, as Emine grew up, she became more and more unruly, stuck-up and disliked by everyone. She would drive away the suitors who came to the house and embarrass her father in front of his guests. Hüseyin Ağa set a condition for his daughter; either he would put someone in front of his daughter that he wanted, or the Ağa would marry her off to someone he deemed suitable. Emine had been waiting for Murat, whom she had been in love with for a long time, to want her. But Murat did not think of getting married, he roamed around like a vagabond all day and enjoyed his day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zeytinyağlı Yiyemem Aman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
