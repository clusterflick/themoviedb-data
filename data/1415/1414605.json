For 16 year old Sophie fitting in proves to be challenging. Things get off to an embarrassing start when mom goes full Karen mode on the school secretary. Being partnered with a pair of sexist guys in marketing class doesn’t make things easier for her - neither does learning about women’s rights when she can’t tell the gender of her study partner. A newfound crush convinces her to join his club - but is he too good to be true? From the trendy divas in her biology class to making friends with the friendliest Taylor Swift fan at school, authenticity proves hard to find.  But with all the pressure to fit in, finding the courage to stand out becomes the biggest challenge of all.","popularity":0.2734,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":249645,"logo_path":null,"name":"young actors project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"As if starting Junior year wasn't hard enough, try doing it at a new school without any friends.","title":"Sixteen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"16","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Diab","original_name":"Rosemary Diab","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"677f6909a6778aa5b37b2672","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adison Hardy","original_name":"Adison Hardy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Faith","credit_id":"677f6929e0d56493e4bb2a0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brooke Bartlett","original_name":"Brooke Bartlett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Teacher","credit_id":"677f6946a6778aa5b37b2691","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2024747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brent Hirose","original_name":"Brent Hirose","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/2Xf6y7MNYypoSmAYmfjHrQXukqy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marketing Teacher","credit_id":"677f696b1431e0591abaf35c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve James","original_name":"Steve James","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Anderson","credit_id":"677f69ed12667968854e94a2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f6b33912cb27280baf854","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f6b5812667968854e94eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f6b78912cb27280baf879","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168376,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Morgan Dasilva-Rolph","original_name":"Morgan Dasilva-Rolph","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f6c0ea6778aa5b37b274c","department":"Production","job":"Casting Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Randall","original_name":"Catherine Randall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f6c36a6778aa5b37b277d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Randall","original_name":"Robert Randall","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f6c61044b6ca6764e817a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31843358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"youngactorsproject","instagram_id":"young_actors_project","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":10873,"name":"school"},{"id":208349,"name":"kids"},{"id":327676,"name":"junior year"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sixteen","key":"OxmWvhLeItk","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-16T17:00:11.000Z","id":"677f6db11431e0591abaf454"}]}}}
