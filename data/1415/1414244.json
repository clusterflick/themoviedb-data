Hilma is a city girl from a well-off family. They dream about a happy life together. Construction specialist Pilliroog becomes covetous and puts pressure on Hilma's bourgeoisie parents in order to catch Hilma's attention and win her friendship. In order to get what he wants, Pilliroog stops at nothing and fears no intrigues nor violence. Depicting the life of the nouveau riche in Tallinn during 1920s adds the socio-critical touch to the silent film. Only 1 min and 9 seconds of this film are preserved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3bEPidtmOFcDbt3EZ8Srk7NZMGx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Klubi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1927-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kevade unelm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Russy","original_name":"Georg Russy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Enn Mänd, tehnikumi üliõpilane","credit_id":"677e8b51e0d56493e4bb0b41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Silber","original_name":"Elsa Silber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hilma Aamisep, tõusiku tütar","credit_id":"677e8b6544d649ffae7b0f4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Puhov","original_name":"Leonid Puhov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ants Kivistik, üliõpilane","credit_id":"677e8b8ee0d56493e4bb0b80","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Päts","original_name":"Olga Päts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aino","credit_id":"677e8b9c601acfe7bd4e686d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Köösel","original_name":"Johan Köösel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jaak Aamisep","credit_id":"677e8bac34a4e75e497b0e46","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Holts","original_name":"Olga Holts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aamisepa naine","credit_id":"677e8bb6a6778aa5b37b094d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Hindrea","original_name":"Alfred Hindrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pilliroog, ehitusmeister","credit_id":"677e8bc5e0d56493e4bb0b92","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Udal","original_name":"Anna Udal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Hilda","credit_id":"677e8bcf34a4e75e497b0e5b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Voldemar Päts","original_name":"Voldemar Päts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7Cj9M1FjzQYyNUJBvqMnOl0dnez.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ehitusinsener","credit_id":"677e8bdda6778aa5b37b095e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Voldemar Päts","original_name":"Voldemar Päts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7Cj9M1FjzQYyNUJBvqMnOl0dnez.jpg","credit_id":"677e8c03218fd57acf4e6a05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Voldemar Päts","original_name":"Voldemar Päts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7Cj9M1FjzQYyNUJBvqMnOl0dnez.jpg","credit_id":"677e8c12044b6ca6764e63bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166811,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Voldemar Mannov","original_name":"Voldemar Mannov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e8c1e218fd57acf4e6a16","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212272","wikidata_id":"Q12366903","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1028,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3bEPidtmOFcDbt3EZ8Srk7NZMGx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":685}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
