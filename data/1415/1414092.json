This mass migration gave birth to a new artistic movement. Using the corner of 15th & Irving Streets in NW DC as their home base, artists brought meaning to a uniquely Salvadoran-Wachintonian identity.\r In the process, they shaped the city’s vibrant, longstanding, and thriving cultural scene.\r Las Muertes Más Bellas del Mundo tells a story of the Salvadoran diaspora’s struggles and humanity through the eyes of artists who created art out of war.\r The film follows a poet’s journey to find acceptance and healing through his writing of Las Muertes and interweaves a collection of Salvadoran-Wachintonian artist portraits – a poet, a photographer, a dancer, and musicians.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Most Beautiful Deaths in the World","title":"Las Muertes Más Bellas del Mundo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
