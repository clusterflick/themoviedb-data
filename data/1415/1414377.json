Unfortunately, Oidinoy has not yet reached school age. And each time, the teacher sends the persistent little girl out of the classroom, patiently explaining to the child that she should come next year when she grows up a little, and then she will definitely be accepted into the school. Oidina, smart beyond her years, shows extraordinary talent in everything: she sews dolls, plays the violin, dances, sings. But the most amazing thing is that inexplicable fantastic visions appear all the time in the night skies over the village of Dune. And only Grandfather Ehson-buwa knows that it is the dreams of his beloved granddaughter that are reflected in the starry heavens.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":216201,"logo_path":null,"name":"«Gala-film» studio","origin_country":"UZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UZ","name":"Uzbekistan"}],"release_date":"2009-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moon-Eyed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5167260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjona Shavkatova","original_name":"Марджона Шавкатова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"677ec9ea601acfe7bd4e7388","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khusan Amirkulov","original_name":"Хусан Амиркулов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/20tp9TohTUwhsSRS3dtb6o0p6pX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"677eca9b3881c79419bb1e7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilmira Rahimjanova","original_name":"Ilmira Rahimjanova","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"677ecae6c81acaa63dbb2b4c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zulfiya Raimkulova","original_name":"Зульфия Раимкулова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"677ecb38c81acaa63dbb2b9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tukhtasyn Muratov","original_name":"Tukhtasyn Muratov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"677ecb88b11d0881117b1d5c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2402704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bekzod Hamraev","original_name":"Бехзод Хамраев","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"677ecb94f2c621807dbb21cb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2085127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazim Abbasov","original_name":"Nazim Abbasov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/f2ZGViHQb6uXAIwbO82kqQKhOCC.jpg","credit_id":"677ecbc4f2c621807dbb21f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2085127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazim Abbasov","original_name":"Nazim Abbasov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/f2ZGViHQb6uXAIwbO82kqQKhOCC.jpg","credit_id":"677ecbceb11d0881117b1d7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
