Ada was employed as a seamstress and cook for four explorers, who hoped to claim the island for the British Empire. However, the four men fell ill and eventually died or disappeared while attempting to seek help, leaving Ada to survive alone on the island for three long months. The words you hear in the film are unedited extracts from Ada’s diary, expressing her concern for her young son Bennett, who she reluctantly left behind in a care home.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":249562,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silver Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Ayagaduk Ojanen","original_name":"Carrie Ayagaduk Ojanen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voice of Ada Blackjack","credit_id":"677e6d93e0d56493e4bb0756","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2429536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Cupples","original_name":"Aaron Cupples","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e6dc9e0d56493e4bb0767","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Laity","original_name":"Adam Laity","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e6dd2e0d56493e4bb076f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406222,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elan Gamaker","original_name":"Elan Gamaker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e6de4601acfe7bd4e6439","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2104614,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sara Pinheiro","original_name":"Sara Pinheiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e6defa6778aa5b37b03d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212856,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Bramley","original_name":"Sophie Bramley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677e6dfea6778aa5b37b03de","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Special Effects Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2167852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Williams Gamaker","original_name":"Michelle Williams Gamaker","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":"/nLZJ1iEsEOh6cG9HknK5Dda0aXd.jpg","credit_id":"678111572b29a918d04e7c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35315358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
