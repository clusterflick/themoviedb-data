Hydrogen plays a central role in this. At the same time, countries in Africa such as Morocco and Namibia are gearing up to become giga-suppliers of the new energy source. But does it all make sense? Why not just produce green steel in Africa? And what's the story behind the blue hydrogen that is supposed to come from Norway via pipeline? The film follows pioneers on breathtaking projects and shows that the energy transition is more complicated than expected and holds many surprises in store.","popularity":0.4258,"poster_path":"/pyxRzDNCLYDZRWcoOPIbQKWMcdK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eikon Film","origin_country":""},{"id":88880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miramonte Film","origin_country":""},{"id":249609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Relation 04 Media","origin_country":""},{"id":22926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magnet Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2024-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hydrogen - Revolution or Illusion","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Pichler","original_name":"Andreas Pichler","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":"/e3U9xKKfYxRMo1Iue7VGlXCDmiY.jpg","credit_id":"677ef2b0c81acaa63dbb2dba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pyxRzDNCLYDZRWcoOPIbQKWMcdK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":952}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4377,"name":"high technology"},{"id":175980,"name":"greenhouse gases"},{"id":179670,"name":"propeller airplane"},{"id":238508,"name":"environmental issues"},{"id":239616,"name":"airplane setting"},{"id":242164,"name":"scientific research"},{"id":256187,"name":"environmental perspectives"},{"id":257092,"name":"industrial pollution"},{"id":270971,"name":"environmental crisis"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":322437,"name":"industrial documentary"},{"id":325892,"name":"science documentary"},{"id":333257,"name":"environmentally-themed"},{"id":334788,"name":"environmental movement"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
