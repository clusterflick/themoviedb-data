Footage shot in California and Caucasus Mountains is overlaid with the poetry of Nima Yooshij, June Jordan, Etel Adnan, and contemporary artist Emilia Yang, to map exile as a space of collective difference and transnational solidarity. Against the passivity of nostalgia and the impossibility of assimilation it is the figure of ‘stranger’ (June Jordan) that keeps the surging waves of displacement alive.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/mqOOtliFYYHzkP5JMPD0qbGTL1q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2023-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Keep the Mountain at Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2831473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gelare Khoshgozaran","original_name":"Gelare Khoshgozaran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fde47a6778aa5b37b37f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mqOOtliFYYHzkP5JMPD0qbGTL1q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
