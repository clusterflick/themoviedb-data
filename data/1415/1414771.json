In the early 1970s, Captain Matchbox became a phenomenon, delighting audiences with lively performances of Fats Waller classics like My Canary Has Circles Under His Eyes and quirky originals such as Wangaratta Wahine and Fernando’s Hideaway. Mic’s passion for vaudeville and creating instruments from anything at hand has driven his work across countless bands over the last 40 years, blending performance, circus, and humour. Jim, a blues purist, found his voice in Captain Matchbox as a harmonica player, becoming one of Australia’s foremost blues harp players.","popularity":0.0746,"poster_path":"/p12TGKVFna7gDOzLeOuRjcNoTte.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whoopee Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Cochrane","original_name":"Fiona Cochrane","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fe6757732209e17bb334d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p12TGKVFna7gDOzLeOuRjcNoTte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antenna Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
