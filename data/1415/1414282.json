But to marry her, the inexperienced marksman Max must participate in an archaic tradition and score in a shooting trial – an unfulfillable challenge for him. The dubious war veteran Kaspar knows about this. He convinces the scrivener to meet him at Wolf’s Glen at midnight to forge “free bullets” that never miss their target. Max, who does not see any other way out of his unfortunate situation, sells his soul to the devil. Not knowing about the catch behind this deal: while six of the cursed bullets will hit the desired target, the seventh lies in the devil’s hands.","popularity":0.185,"poster_path":"/9cCP3MlVpWCnxIvRCgjRG3rW5p7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Freischütz - Von der Seebühne Bregenz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liviu Holender","original_name":"Liviu Holender","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ottokar","credit_id":"677e9b0689fc5d94424e7580","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Hawlata","original_name":"Franz Hawlata","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kuno","credit_id":"677e9b1534a4e75e497b11b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikola Hillebrand","original_name":"Nikola Hillebrand","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Agathe","credit_id":"677e9b29601acfe7bd4e6b90","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5166919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Ruckgaber","original_name":"Katharina Ruckgaber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ähnchen","credit_id":"677e9b3cc81acaa63dbb1f3b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christof Fischesser","original_name":"Christof Fischesser","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/tQ3DQcmKC3NqXHuuaOEdH3fHlmr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kaspar","credit_id":"677e9b4d89fc5d94424e7590","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauro Peter","original_name":"Mauro Peter","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/uq4Jz4TAZoqL62SAVWDYNkwTBZx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Max","credit_id":"677e9b5734a4e75e497b11e0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1821063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moritz von Treuenfels","original_name":"Moritz von Treuenfels","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/5DRuJQTIVYXCvjfSnIzJuTWk9QK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Samiel","credit_id":"677e9b6934a4e75e497b11f9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Stölzl","original_name":"Philipp Stölzl","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/zlq8SY4Tu7DSV87w4Rgh4IRZzuJ.jpg","credit_id":"677e9a43b11d0881117b1575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172810,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Gesine Völlm","original_name":"Gesine Völlm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782a364601acfe7bd4ef78e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Stölzl","original_name":"Philipp Stölzl","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/zlq8SY4Tu7DSV87w4Rgh4IRZzuJ.jpg","credit_id":"6782a37d136e157cf27b07bb","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248214,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Florian Schmitt","original_name":"Florian Schmitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782a392601acfe7bd4ef7b3","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172812,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wendy Hesketh-Ogilvie","original_name":"Wendy Hesketh-Ogilvie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782a3b38c2309ceafbb0030","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172813,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alwin Bösch","original_name":"Alwin Bösch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782a3dfbd793c03544e70f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172814,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clemens Wannemacher","original_name":"Clemens Wannemacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782a3ed3881c79419bba937","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615694,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Petzold","original_name":"Jan Petzold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782a3fdee84fa4def7b4835","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172816,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olaf A.
