cinematic art, especially the projection of films on celluloid.","popularity":0.0623,"poster_path":"/gNCJkyBWEhbOhabZLzLBkCNcN8A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249583,"logo_path":null,"name":"FEITIO","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film
