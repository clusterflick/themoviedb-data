Since 2021, the Canadian government has been planning to further extend MAiD to people whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental disorder. It became one of the most toxic and contentious debates in Canadian medical and parliamentary history, and highlighted a striking lack of compassion, empathy and understanding towards people who have been suffering from profound mental anguish for decades. NO WAY TO DIE follows two deeply mentally ill individuals, Jane Hunter and Savannah Meadows, both of whom had been planning to apply for MAiD, watching in sadness, anger and torment as a phalanx of opponents launch a ferocious (and often misleading) effort to halt the government's plan to offer relief to people like them-people who are out of resiliency and out of options.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Material Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Way to Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc de Guerre","original_name":"Marc de Guerre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f3b052037ff04c94e7f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc de Guerre","original_name":"Marc de Guerre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f3b14f2c621807dbb34c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rose Bolton","original_name":"Rose Bolton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f3b3cf2c621807dbb3508","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879624,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sasha Jordan Appler","original_name":"Sasha Jordan Appler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f3b4e2037ff04c94e7f80","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500087,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carole Larsen","original_name":"Carole Larsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f3b5e044b6ca6764e7eae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc de Guerre","original_name":"Marc de Guerre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f3bfea6778aa5b37b21e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35288405","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
