For the past decades, abortion divided the country and the voters. Now it’s public libraries that have been transformed into the new battlefields in America’s cultural wars.

This film follows four distinct stories that illuminate and explain the evolution of this newest battleground in America’s long culture war.","popularity":0.1313,"poster_path":"/55I1NfhGmawW7R3WroAaPvElV7L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serge Gordey for Temps noir","origin_country":""},{"id":249614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paul Cadieux for Filmoption","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Library Wars: A New Front In America's Cultural Wars","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Amerikas Bücherkrieg","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Ziv","original_name":"Ilan Ziv","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677f0286601acfe7bd4e8229","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6q4Z8ytIuiusEamj3kAjfpdEu2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWLr40OrVUenLaZ46M1cIrpyMSF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/evpWMM0dQpwhopHUGU0G7rZNLIw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1612,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/55I1NfhGmawW7R3WroAaPvElV7L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1074},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5RCR0jarzxqgyNU0lQkURKSYRVk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
