Two South Londoners tried to change that, starting up their own music video channel, they soared above the top dogs, until they tried to bring them down.  Through Interviews with bands, fan’s and the creator’s of P-Rock TV we look into DIY nature of the punk, ska, “alternative” music industry. Shining a light on the community this music scene has as well as answering the age old mystery of what happened to P-Rock TV.  Many elements of the story will be told through dramatizations, in style of early 2000s music videos, using mixed media such as stop motion, 2d animation as well as shooting on mini dv and film. The overall tone should be uplifting, championing forging your own path and sometimes the only way too get something done is say fuck it and do it yourself.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/rqS5aadFKT6abeSHfjTWDl0jtgA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Knight Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"P-Rock The Doc","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5169030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Shipman","original_name":"Alex Shipman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fe79789fc5d94424e9bd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.856,"height":243,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rIS3dsSd0gcDFJyQajYm2kyoM7A.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":694}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2666,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rqS5aadFKT6abeSHfjTWDl0jtgA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"P-Rock the Doc - Teaser Trailer","key":"JFYdXadxPr4","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-29T16:29:33.000Z","id":"677feae32b29a918d04e498d"}]}}}
