Three different eras, three different settings, three different ‘colours’; though for Puccini, it is through the contrasts between them that the unity of the work is revealed. For his second time directing at La Monnaie, Tobias Kratzer preserves the original order of the pieces, while weaving them together to form a narrative whole, like a circle with no end. With a cast of artists from the extended La Monnaie family, Alain Altinoglu is the ideal conductor to meet the daunting challenges posed by this triptych.","popularity":0.3635,"poster_path":"/wXd8DRnuwBSovfVBpBQoOfiG6k3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82718,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Munt / La
