The first banned Estonian film tells a grotesque story about the comical adventures of a naive priest and an ebrious sacristan during a winter bear hunt. The funny burlesque taking place in the beautiful landscape of Southern Estonia takes an unexpected turn when after the three day hunt the priest returns home and instead of his modest wife he will find a fashionable looking woman. His wife has meanwhile been in town to get a close-cropped haircut and acquire modern social etiquette.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/k0LyDA3x10AjYPxpW1CSOBXQjOU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taara-film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1930-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pühapäevakütid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","title":"Karujaht, Õpetaja ja köster karujahil","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Laas","original_name":"Karl Laas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Õpetaja","credit_id":"677fc14061a873952c7b2ccb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Leies","original_name":"Georg Leies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Köster","credit_id":"677fc14f44d649ffae7b3f44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Holts","original_name":"Olga Holts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Köstriemand","credit_id":"677fc16961a873952c7b2cd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ly Schönberg","original_name":"Ly Schönberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Õpetajaproua","credit_id":"677fc17612667968854ea1ec","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168745,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gustav Pihlak","original_name":"Gustav Pihlak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fc1b012667968854ea27f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5165562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Balduin Kusbock","original_name":"Balduin Kusbock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/i9diSsLhB3jYsHnR7E3z7Qcy0sO.jpg","credit_id":"677fc1be12667968854ea28c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5168745,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gustav Pihlak","original_name":"Gustav Pihlak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fc1c912667968854ea295","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1884268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Märska","original_name":"Konstantin Märska","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677fc1dbc81acaa63dbb42a5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1327,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k0LyDA3x10AjYPxpW1CSOBXQjOU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":885}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
