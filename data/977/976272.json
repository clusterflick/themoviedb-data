The first site of the project is Piazza del Popolo, a natural stage set in continuous motion where the camera has been set up, like the minute hand of a clock, to complete a 360° revolution over the course of an hour. The result is an extra–ordinary temporal flux, whereby 8 hours of film have been accelerated to a 1:20 ratio, resulting in 24 minutes of time–lapse video. The camera’s eye gradually discovers the site’s hidden identity, encountering strange narcoleptic beings who sleep, stare, act and inhabit the architecture and send mysterious signals while oblivious pedestrians flash precipitously by. The performers move through a parallel temporal landscape in which they experience the dimension of permanence. This flux is charged with visions and omens in which other possibilities of life take form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/16ze5DtlWNfDP5gwWmAZek8HKCO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panorama Roma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3551134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zimmerfrei","original_name":"Zimmerfrei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6281415dfd140b569a699aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16ze5DtlWNfDP5gwWmAZek8HKCO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
