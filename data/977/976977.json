Do we belong to nature or does nature belongs to us? A thought-provoking story in which documentary maker Marijn Poels explores the human urge to control our climate, security and preferably the other. Balancing on a razor-thin line between regulation and manipulation. When technology reigns supreme and common sense vaporizes through the test of time, humanity is on the brink of becoming the tool. Miles away from the collective panic, fear and chaos, there is hope, inspiration and reconnection.","popularity":0.2181,"poster_path":"/kpDEIn5sKGBBtsSxRNWbLOQtfXp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marijn Poels Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Return To Eden - Itâ€™s all about coming home.","title":"Return to Eden","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marijn Poels","original_name":"Marijn Poels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"640f6ff7ede1b0007b4e4552","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Savory","original_name":"Allan Savory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"640f7026323eba00ef627692","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marijn Poels","original_name":"Marijn Poels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6283e62efd140b300ec5157b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12678438","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kpDEIn5sKGBBtsSxRNWbLOQtfXp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1576,"name":"technology"},{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":305898,"name":"climate science"},{"id":314611,"name":"regulation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"What is science - Return To Eden","key":"rt0m4PltGHA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-14T07:10:58.000Z","id":"640f6f39c390c500796f0dac"}]}}}
