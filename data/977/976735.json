When slavery was abolished in 1834, the UK government paid compensation to slave owners, but the enslaved received nothing. In the wake of the racial reckoning in America following the death of George Floyd, Grenada's national commission on reparations for slavery has begun to meet and debate what reparations means. In this film, Laura she travels to Grenada to try and learn more about the legacy of slavery on Grenada and her family's involvement in the slave trade.","popularity":0.7938,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GD","name":"Grenada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grenada: Confronting the Past","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3159353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Trevelyan","original_name":"Laura Trevelyan","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/A8DwrXCAXv1Sh9zUWewq1HwAU4I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"6282d414058224006604ae7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Phillip-Dowe","original_name":"Nicole Phillip-Dowe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6282d570982f74006853d9de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dunbar 'DC' Campbell","original_name":"Dunbar 'DC' Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6282d58ecee481541d59d5be","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garfield Hankey","original_name":"Garfield Hankey","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6282d662031a1d14ac3b747a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arley Gill","original_name":"Arley Gill","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6282d69a20e6a51a19de71e9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552864,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Koralie Barrau","original_name":"Koralie Barrau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6282d831ec455200a516469a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552885,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Ivers","original_name":"Mike Ivers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6282e557abf8e2009deba25c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vara Szajkowski","original_name":"Vara Szajkowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6282e5bd87a27a009eb7e62f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552890,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Robbins","original_name":"Sarah Robbins","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6282ea10058224006604f116","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552868,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephen Greaves","original_name":"Stephen Greaves","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6282dbd3dcf875334cbceaa6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2831,"name":"slavery"},{"id":3136,"name":"plantation"},{"id":163120,"name":"slave trade"},{"id":208067,"name":"imperialism"},{"id":285917,"name":"carribean"},{"id":297038,"name":"reperations"},{"id":297039,"name":"grenada"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC World News","release_date":"2022-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
