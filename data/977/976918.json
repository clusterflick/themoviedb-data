During the drive, they ruminate on the departure and the resulting ruptured relationship. Before leaving, Jack entrusts his car to Wan-yu. Underneath Wan-yu’s calm and almost indifferent façade lies a hidden anxiety and confusion, for other than the car, she has to deal with another more complicated problem of her own. Shot as a conversation in a car, the short’s claustrophobic atmosphere heightens the helplessness of the characters. From director Wong Fei, winner of the 15th Fresh Wave Award, comes a quiet and contemplative piece about making difficult decisions amid drastic changes in life.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/6VAwKtC3ujL4Eg5gwn5vzvyu5qQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phoebe Au","original_name":"Phoebe Au","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62c34811773941007d2a07de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Ng Chi-kit","original_name":"Joseph Ng Chi-kit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62c34830af6e942c952700e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fung Wai-shing","original_name":"Fung Wai-shing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3484a544c41004cb7c391","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chan Wun-ling","original_name":"Chan Wun-ling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62c34870c525c4004b87654b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3270586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Fei","original_name":"Wong Fei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6283c3269ca7590066254183","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3270586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Fei","original_name":"Wong Fei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c347d14a4bfc005a870c62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3270594,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"MOK Yeuk-fai","original_name":"MOK Yeuk-fai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c347ec3a48c50059c4a370","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArxmajZbdNrET7wXe7Atr97Llb8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VAwKtC3ujL4Eg5gwn5vzvyu5qQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1018}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
