Having found a job in home care for the elderly, the woman will have to reach the people assigned to her in the most remote places, discovering a world that lives the contingent situation with serene acceptance. In front of the camera, women and men on the threshold of a hundred years old expose personal memories and emotions, letting themselves be infected by the unpredictable musical drifts of the protagonist. As in an ethnographic film revisited by Jacques Demy, real-life cinema and musical come together, creating an unprecedented experiment that is also social.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4DIEGfJKQvPZzG2nKD4gYOkRGk7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Badabò","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rossella Faa","original_name":"Rossella Faa","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62823072dcf875334dcee8e0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Cau","original_name":"Stefano Cau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6282308a20e6a51a182ce397","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Marras","original_name":"Andrea Marras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62835e1a8d77c4005073ac6a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Cau","original_name":"Stefano Cau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62835e276d9fe834938266d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cladinè Curreli","original_name":"Cladinè Curreli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62835e36873f006bb3aa1676","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/4DIEGfJKQvPZzG2nKD4gYOkRGk7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Bellaria Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
