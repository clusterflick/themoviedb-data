Three students from the Audio-Visual team are shooting a documentary on a schoolmate who has recently committed suicide. It is intended to convey a ‘positive message’ to the entire school about the importance of life. During interviews, the students notice some discrepancies in the testimonies, particularly those by a prefect and a teacher, while friends of the deceased seem to be withholding some inconvenient truth. Should the team pursue the truth, or act as the school’s propagandist? Filmed in a mocumentary style, The Handbook of Suicide Prevention challenges and exposes the hypocrisy and suppression that haunt adolescence.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/aKLNr6GenlLFQju0Ak3PMRMPq7M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Handbook of Suicide Prevention","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Siu-tung","original_name":"Li Siu-tung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62c346573a48c5007cb16c4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Sum-yu","original_name":"Lee Sum-yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62c3467e2a210c06cbd58e70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chan Kin-ho","original_name":"Chan Kin-ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62c346ad773941005aca0dde","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Kin-yi","original_name":"Leung Kin-yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62c346db3af9290059a1c350","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Wong Ka-nok","original_name":"Jonathan Wong Ka-nok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6283c5f50859b4009a8462dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611876,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giddens Chan Wun-chak","original_name":"Giddens Chan Wun-chak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c34715af6e942c96a0da9a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Wong Ka-nok","original_name":"Jonathan Wong Ka-nok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c346f93a48c50059c4a333","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3611879,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wong Yik-fung","original_name":"Wong Yik-fung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669702ce3750e8465fcf128f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kykK5f4l1hzeGaBOCKsrPatfAJ5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7HOoHJNSRakDnmoVSO3mH3XnRhm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fctGWDX7WuIjuKOqXl2ULuJs2z4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vpn7fmWnPbSsbGviDyyuwM36uSe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1752,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/aKLNr6GenlLFQju0Ak3PMRMPq7M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1168},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1863,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omKWy1bcGXdN8LcQu8OQB2vpp5t.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1242}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"16th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
