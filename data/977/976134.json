Lucky to be alive, he needs to outmaneuver Serbian ground forces who want one thing only - his head. In Afghanistan, a US Marine accidentally falls out a chopper door and into the arms of heavily armed Al Qaeda terrorists. And in Sierra Leone, British soldiers are captured and exploited as live bartering tools by a gang of drunken guerilla warriors. Will these fallen heroes suffer the ultimate sacrifice? Or can their brothers in arms, risking life and limb, rescue them in time?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/44XDqrWNPiBkIT1ixdtLX23LKlQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Commando Rescue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/44XDqrWNPiBkIT1ixdtLX23LKlQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
