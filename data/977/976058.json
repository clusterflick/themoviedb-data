But Hitler couldn't have done it alone. The atrocities of the Nazi party required a vast network of evil; from the intellectual elite who legitimized Hitler's ideas to the public, to the desk-jockeys who carried out his orders with ruthless efficiency, to the low-level thugs who delivered those orders face-to-face and blow-by-blow to their intended victims. Who were these people? What did they do? How did they become this way? And which ones--in some people's minds--are considered as evil--or maybe even more evil--than Hitler himself?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/lF0mwO10yEJo7tgtj9IxwfhCwfO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nazis: Ultimate Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lF0mwO10yEJo7tgtj9IxwfhCwfO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dpunCZHL9AMZIlXr3cAEaikCknN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":549},{"aspect_ratio":0.764,"height":2134,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/xp2FO3znAZJHzJo0knNemvKr8FO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
