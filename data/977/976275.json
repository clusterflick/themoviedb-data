Anamorphosis-- That is, the deforming an image and then straightening it using a suitable mirror-- was once a popular curiosity. Henri Chrétien imagined lenses that make it possible to anamorphose the image when shooting, then to de-anamorphose it when projecting. Shot by Chrétien between 1938 and 1949, \"Vues Hypergonées\", as the film is also known, was restored in 1999 by the French Cinémathèque from a 269-meter nitrate copy, for the retrospective “Jeune, Dure et Pure! A history of avant-garde and experimental cinema in France\".","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/f8lzo4RfdtkTVcuGvAabyPMDGYw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Hypergonar","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Chrétien","original_name":"Henri Chrétien","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/8RtcDVWi40zcjkRjQdHX5kL7GKI.jpg","credit_id":"628142ddcee48100502dd6d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8lzo4RfdtkTVcuGvAabyPMDGYw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5SLryPKH9BAEPW9e1sDDY09GgL8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
