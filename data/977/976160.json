Based on his own life, actor Choi Cheol-ho, the leader of the theatrical troupe Stray Dog Bullet, directs, writes, and stars in the film, which depicts a family that faces difficulties without forgetting to laugh and encourage each other in the midst of severe circumstances such as racial prejudice and poverty. In a zainichi Korean town in Ikuno, a funeral is being held for Omoni, who was like a mother to everyone. However, her eldest son Yong-gi, who disappeared 15 years ago, is not there. The three siblings, except Yeong-gi, are at their wit's end, burdened with debts from the store that Omoni used to run. Yeong-gi eventually returns, but the siblings are bewildered by his changed appearance.
