Jenny comes up with a scheme for beating the lottery, which involves the seduction of Byron, an accountant who was hired to keep the lottery honest after the previous accountant dropped dead during the show. As the scheme proceeds, difficulties arise. A cleaning man, originally from India, is suspicious when he sees the lottery - supposedly live - being pre-taped; and the person chosen to buy the winning ticket is pursued by a loan shark. As the scheme unwinds, more and more people in Toronto - and India - learn the winning numbers of the upcoming draw. Meanwhile, Jenny and the accountant start falling in love. Her determined efforts ultimately turn an imminent disaster into a financial and romantic success.","popularity":1.4881,"poster_path":"/hmkyb7C9tgQUb1yy0qn6VYax4hS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norflicks Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balls Up","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Lóvá tett szerencse","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Schultz","original_name":"Albert Schultz","popularity":0.194,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Byron","credit_id":"65d424c023d278017cf41206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torri Higginson","original_name":"Torri Higginson","popularity":0.5134,"profile_path":"/gMYIyJKmfPxX12lRFFAV1NeIymI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"65d424ca414291017ca228a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Dubin","original_name":"Ellen Dubin","popularity":0.2947,"profile_path":"/cvf1pX4t6ZzDPsRi9J2xGrGj78c.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tracy","credit_id":"65d424d4967cc7018662b4e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":180937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allegra Fulton","original_name":"Allegra Fulton","popularity":0.2295,"profile_path":"/hw5zfA4QVLK4WVgtVUfA1oXYn6N.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"65d424debbe1dd01645e89b0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pam Hyatt","original_name":"Pam Hyatt","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/yWZeZ22BnLYU35dX5QgjOhwtY0r.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"65d424f47d5db501633615a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":183919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Sinha","original_name":"Pamela Sinha","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/rJnByyn8jB5V4MmezqHl2mXYhow.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Macbool","credit_id":"65d424feeb79c2014b43c25c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vik Sahay","original_name":"Vik Sahay","popularity":0.8007,"profile_path":"/690bPfmzaXsrZ1eDcUOCDT5TPpq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Debdash","credit_id":"65d4250856b9f7017cb1b648","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Moses","original_name":"Sam Moses","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/huGipz3rKcNV9O19cSQjTNGz2d3.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Guru","credit_id":"65d42513967cc70163625504","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Potts","original_name":"Jonathan Potts","popularity":0.3999,"profile_path":"/wQgtJsdFJI7FNYiRPlfYx9Y4zeB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ken","credit_id":"65d4251ee640d6017dec27be","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel S.
