Granny Di makes a meagre living out of recycling cardboard and found objects on the street, carrying the ashes of her late husband wherever she goes. As the going gets tough, she is reduced to stealing and selling sacrificial offerings from the funeral home. Ellen Liu plays the desolate and desperate Granny Di, rendering a lively and moving performance with a human touch. The short brings us through the nooks and crannies of Hung Hom district, chronicling a sorrowful tale about forsaken old age.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/vaTG2zDl5vX4p9BINXloieSw73B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2188297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Liu Oi-Ling","original_name":"Ellen Liu Oi-Ling","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62b19cb990cf5100535134ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3611896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu Kam-chu","original_name":"Yu Kam-chu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62c348db3af929007ca5d037","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teddy Tsui Chiu-fai","original_name":"Teddy Tsui Chiu-fai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6283c46fcee481544b18b1c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":970,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vaTG2zDl5vX4p9BINXloieSw73B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"16th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
