The haughty princess complains to her father the emperor, expecting him to exact punishment on Guo Ai for what she regarded as abuse. The wise and benevolent emperor devises a plan to teach both Guo Ai and his daughter a lesson. This is the sole surviving Singapore-made Hokkien (Amoy dialect) film out of only three, and was the first and only Hokkien opera film wholly funded and produced by Singapore or Malaya film companies and talents. It was an unprecedented venture by local arts and cultural groups to document the vernacular Chinese traditional performing arts through cinema. The cast were renowned opera performers from the popular Sin Kee Lin Hokkien Opera Troupe.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/eQxDlcg5FwJTzsaKAI8pkmcmrb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong United Co., Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taming of the Princess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hsu Chiao Meng","original_name":"Hsu Chiao Meng","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628358f3fd140b300c1134ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eQxDlcg5FwJTzsaKAI8pkmcmrb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1156}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"Hokkien","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
