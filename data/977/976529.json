From the late Renaissance to the present, revolutions and traditions have alternated, leaving an uninterrupted flow of images imprinted in the memory of the centuries-old tree. Shot using a drone in a 15-minute sequence plan, The Great Oak is the result of a courageous technical challenge, but above all a conceptual one: to overturn the anthropocentric point of view of film narration and offer a more articulate perspective on reality, on the invisible links between living beings and on our role in the world.","popularity":0.0879,"poster_path":"/15pnTdMKSZJ3OW8kLCbKpVPnpKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180281,"logo_path":null,"name":"anima
