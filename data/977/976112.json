Through this agreement, Europe was to be thrown into war. For a long time, the relationship between Hitler and Stalin was ignored: their mutual fascination, their moves to get closer, the marks of confidence they exchanged and all the benefits they derived from the German-Soviet pact, before resuming their war to the death in June 41 with the \"Barbarossa\" operation.","popularity":0.0957,"poster_path":"/8k683GKiuKM9QspAANjt80YYew8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39460,"logo_path":"/AiQxylbHR61M4NA6KmQ2aFKhOt2.png","name":"Siècle Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler-Staline, le choc des tyrans","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Hitler-Stalin, un xoc de tirans","type":"Catalan language"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michaël Prazan","original_name":"Michaël Prazan","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/2QUiAqMU9fGsvEbJfRzMkl7fjOO.jpg","credit_id":"62841018bf09d100ab471499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20232608","wikidata_id":"Q117795130","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wXpyt9l8mqktNiXJUk297WQhRH4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.393,"height":460,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/3VNcmPmYOwUt6CikbAnnyGArWCX.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1101}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1157,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8k683GKiuKM9QspAANjt80YYew8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":771},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1155,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yjReRYBdt1AcGRdNXfKE0hGfgJl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":770},{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/nUrFLzqv5oE8u0NQQsX67p3InuK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Une (in 2 parts)","release_date":"2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 3","release_date":"2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
