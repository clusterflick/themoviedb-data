Threatened by the arrival of German troops on the island too, resist. Armed with a 8mm camera, they create an army of \"nameless soldiers\" who panic the Nazi machine. A film about love, passion for art and the resistance of two heroines who challenge totalitarianism with the power of the imagination; a work that supports the radical flair of its protagonists by resorting to divergent narrative and stylistic registers, juxtaposing the analog creaks of surrealist ascendancy with more \"contemporary\", muscular, punk-looking forms of subversion typical of genre cinema.","popularity":0.2156,"poster_path":"/u26dNg6iVtMLbQzffPL6ilZgYSI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69202,"logo_path":"/9fzgnt1PkVQw0d4twUVej4pmp8N.png","name":"Bathysphere Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Héroïnes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Demeyer","original_name":"Sophie Demeyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64dd94fad100b614b159e34a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Moynot","original_name":"Jeanne Moynot","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64dd95015ab81a00c5b5fc7d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurélien Deseez","original_name":"Aurélien Deseez","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64dd95085ab81a00ffc0e689","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Föry","original_name":"Julia Föry","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64dd950fa3b5e600c5bc4d02","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4096547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian McKinnon","original_name":"Julian McKinnon","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd95205ab81a00ad1fd7f3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287758,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gabriel Gonzalez","original_name":"Gabriel Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/uEKVf1tTL7VVPe2yckXOkgG519G.jpg","credit_id":"64dd953159e8a9011c8bbc46","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1886901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Charles Bastion","original_name":"Jean-Charles Bastion","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd953a37109700c51da420","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astré Desrives","original_name":"Astré Desrives","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd951959e8a900c5a0797f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2229025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amine Berrada","original_name":"Amine Berrada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd95415ab81a00c5b5fca5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astré Desrives","original_name":"Astré Desrives","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628385eff5c82400a56b486c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u26dNg6iVtMLbQzffPL6ilZgYSI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
