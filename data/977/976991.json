This one is about the outlaw art form called Graffiti (bombing) where your name and the crew you rep is key. To society it’s vandalism, to graffiti writers it’s a part of everyday life. The late nights, the rattle of a spray can being emptied of its paint, running subway tunnels dodging the iron giants, the dangerous city nights, the chase from the law, the beef, the battles, and the rush. That’s what every graffiti writer experiences during his/her graffiti career. The purpose of putting \"State Your Name\" together is to show the true essence of graffiti, it’s not the watered down shit you see on the music videos or on trucker hats. To the old school cats this is a shout out for paving the way, to the newer generation of Graff writers pay your dues and learn your history...","popularity":0.1879,"poster_path":"/cbpF7LWiVHfTlHS0TEViI6uEa3c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oz Perla Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State Your Name","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"OZ","original_name":"OZ","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6283fa7e0d5d85456263a40a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3999377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gone","original_name":"Gone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64307b33e92d830113071b55","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cbpF7LWiVHfTlHS0TEViI6uEa3c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zFya8JuzXG5S7cX9iTw95W0KjjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
