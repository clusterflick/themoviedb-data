The following day, Molly discovers that both her jewels and the girl are missing, and Tom supposes that the strange girl, who gave her name as Isabel Francis, is responsible for the theft. Tom later learns that Isabel is the Princess of Lividia, who has run away from her country rather than marry King Danilo (who has also run away and is in London, paying court to Molly Montrose). Danilo and Isabel are kidnapped by agents of Lividia and taken home to be forcibly wed. Tom and Molly follow them, and Tom prevents the marriage.","popularity":0.4882,"poster_path":"/g9ocdRSc4eEWXfm26uLquu69KZV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greater Than a Crown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Lowe","original_name":"Edmund Lowe","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/8aDjzC5moz2NQZ8aBhBn5bmuFXj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Conway","credit_id":"62816a51387651009f56dcf4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Costello","original_name":"Dolores Costello","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":"/xEsZUdwjqZdIWi2yWDo8mC6Ugt0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Isabel Frances / Princess of Lividia","credit_id":"62816a63fad8e91203fd4c8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Livingston","original_name":"Margaret Livingston","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/7yrbb5QRn6Jy0xRzyzYMer1sh2q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Molly Montrose","credit_id":"62816a756d9fe80068fe1a3b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Hendricks Jr.","original_name":"Ben Hendricks Jr.","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/gpNJtZQ78NvXRmYoErCPuotQJ7y.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tiger Bugg","credit_id":"62816a8c9672ed0066d9f303","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Panzer","original_name":"Paul Panzer","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/6NhO8FSFg6azBGaga5IaSNaUNEs.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Marquis Ferasti","credit_id":"62816a9ed34eb30050bfc6f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Merlo","original_name":"Tony Merlo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"King Danilo","credit_id":"62816ab3c92c5d51d4b8263a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Klein","original_name":"Robert Klein","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Count Seda","credit_id":"62816acd0d5d8507051a11b5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33692,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wyndham Gittens","original_name":"Wyndham Gittens","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62816a3c75110d00507f2f5f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy William Neill","original_name":"Roy William Neill","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/bidntaxwVL49RtayKeh2WQrRrA1.jpg","credit_id":"62816a23c92c5d51d4b823df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Bridges","original_name":"Victoria Bridges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62816a2ecaa50850da993c03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0015880","wikidata_id":"Q3776159","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g9ocdRSc4eEWXfm26uLquu69KZV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1068}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
