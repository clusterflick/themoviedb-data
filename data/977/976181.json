The plot centres around Sarita,  a beautiful young woman who has been predestined to be an actress since she was a child. Headshots of her are sent to Metro Goldwyn Mayer, in hopes of making her a big star and thus help prevent the imminent demolition of the Maracaibo neighbourhood of El Saladillo where she lives in. Everyone anxiously awaits the answer, which may never come.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7p43Lkl0Jjb6GBeaWfYcEQtGftt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joligud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3550873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marau Robelo","original_name":"Marau Robelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sarita Estuche","credit_id":"62811745caa50850da97ccd5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3550926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Consuelo Gonzáles","original_name":"Consuelo Gonzáles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6281218f873f004e7f896739","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3550863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Augusto Pradelli","original_name":"Augusto Pradelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628121a2c92c5d51d4b6e887","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3550863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Augusto Pradelli","original_name":"Augusto Pradelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628115a4cee481006663c493","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0099895","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7p43Lkl0Jjb6GBeaWfYcEQtGftt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
