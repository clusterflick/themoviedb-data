In six months, the community that had been their home for generations would be demolished. DISLOCATION chronicles the lives of tenants in one building as they move through the six-month relocation process. The filmmakers follow three families as they prepare for their own move and as they help others around them. Dislocation is a story of a community coping with its own impending demise. It is a tale of courage, hope, and survival.","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":50946,"logo_path":"/1lTs6kx4LNc48mypKt9F0y5X3XH.png","name":"WTTW/Chicago","origin_country":"US"},{"id":86617,"logo_path":"/xoh9vGYbYdloJh2IwMO1pczA9ab.png","name":"Genco Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dislocation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sudhir Venkatesh","original_name":"Sudhir Venkatesh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a5ebb092514152d1000a82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759133,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jason Morfoot","original_name":"Jason Morfoot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a5ebca92514152ab000a8b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759134,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brock Graham","original_name":"Brock Graham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a5ebd3c3a3681bc8000a32","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759132,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Kamerman","original_name":"Larry Kamerman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a5ebb992514152d7000a62","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0493236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Chicago, Illinois","release_date":"2005-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
