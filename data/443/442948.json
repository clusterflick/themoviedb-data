Nema and Don, made orphans by tuberculosis, are left on the reservation following the wisdom of their science-fearing grandfather and the community’s respected leader, Slow-Talker. Robert, their neighbor and friend, has gone away to school—forsaking tradition, according to his detractors—and has learned the scientific ways of the white man. He has also learned that he has TB and, through rest and treatment, is cured. The film progresses as a battle between traditional faith and contemporary medicine. Medicine wins and Slow-Talker, a convert to its ways, becomes its spokesperson.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/deNRyvG7D8m9lb32cuBeRKs8mvW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another to Conquer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Birdsbill","original_name":"Geraldine Birdsbill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58abeff392514158df0105cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Day","original_name":"Sammy Day","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58abeffdc3a36849e000fa88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard Gorman","original_name":"Howard Gorman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Slow-Talker","credit_id":"58abf00ec3a36849b000ef5e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hogner","original_name":"Richard Hogner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58abf016c3a36849e000faa1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.W.
