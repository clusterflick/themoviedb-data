Marine scientist Marcus Eriksen invited onboard an unusual crew to help him study the sea: renowned surfers Keith &amp; Dan Malloy, musician Jack Johnson, spearfisher woman Kimi Werner, and bodysurfer Mark Cunningham become citizen scientists on a mission to assess the fate of plastics in the world’s oceans.  After years of hearing about the famous “garbage patches” in the ocean’s gyres, the crew is stunned to learn that the patches are a myth: the waters stretching to the horizon are clear blue, with no islands of trash in sight. But as the crew sieves the water and sorts through their haul, a more disturbing reality sets in: a fog of microplastics permeates the world’s oceans, trillions of nearly invisible plastic shards making their way up the marine food chain. You can clean up a garbage patch, but how do you stop a fog?","popularity":0.2008,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Our impacts, use of plastic and its effects on the oceans.","title":"The Smog of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"58a86bbf925141565d00a555","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Johnson","original_name":"Jack Johnson","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/aNPho9m18zey5lV8cI9njqKYsHt.jpg","credit_id":"58a86bf4925141566900978b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Beins","original_name":"Simon Beins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a86c2bc3a368667100993e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760537,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Johnson","original_name":"Kim Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a86c5c9251415691009a0c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmett Malloy","original_name":"Emmett Malloy","popularity":0.0849,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a86c76c3a36866790099b5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Johnson","original_name":"Jack Johnson","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/aNPho9m18zey5lV8cI9njqKYsHt.jpg","credit_id":"58a86c8bc3a368668d009516","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kizzy O'Neal","original_name":"Kizzy O'Neal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a86cc8c3a368661a009b9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"58a86cde9251415671009fa2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"58a86cfbc3a368668500990b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"58a86d149251415661009e54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760545,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"chris shilakes","original_name":"chris shilakes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a86d5d92514156ab00a815","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q120490674","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":33480,"name":"environmental"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Smog of the Sea (Trailer)","key":"jXURG3meS-Q","published_at":"2017-04-14T19:11:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a252597925141032c0d93fb"}]}}}
