The brigadier is transferred to Buzy to investigate, but Buzy is not Champignol, and Captain Raspec is an irascible superior. Suzette is nowhere to be found, and Binoche can't think of anything better than organizing robberies under the name of \"Bandit de la colline aux oiseaux\". This bandit does exist and is on the rampage. His name is Vittorio. Binoche, eager to prove herself, earns the respect of the locals and the friendship of Vittorio, Suzette's own brother.","popularity":0.3394,"poster_path":"/ux6A7g835SHhe6Sm5AGPHZcCPil.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chronos Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1959-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gendarme of Champignol","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Richard","original_name":"Jean Richard","popularity":0.2103,"profile_path":"/qnNsKeI9jfSCNFsKeO3B3Yc7bTQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Claudius Binoche","credit_id":"58a88a77c3a3686425000490","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1502671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véronique Zuber","original_name":"Véronique Zuber","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/vi2YMpzx6fce6RtwzK6a2R5dWmN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Suzette","credit_id":"58c64cabc3a36840f6011bcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Pierre","original_name":"Roger Pierre","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":"/3zAUJjV4OzNMO8V8Kb8jZmD0tJv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vittorio","credit_id":"58c64cb59251411d1101384b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noël Roquevert","original_name":"Noël Roquevert","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/fDKPvwIaOdF35khvifDxYUvnzsY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Raspec","credit_id":"58c64cbec3a36840b8012f8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Basile","original_name":"Nadine Basile","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/sHXm3ufwj1q6psl9oMRCOCszhYn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Suzette Grégorio","credit_id":"58c64cca9251411d550138fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Elloy","original_name":"Max Elloy","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/b9Jl9GNoLyVqw6SsvPuWIaNfPoP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"La Huchette","credit_id":"58c64cddc3a36841140117db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Adam","original_name":"Alfred Adam","popularity":0.392,"profile_path":"/lYsguYFlS522KLgBsuu3NcXayoO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"M.
