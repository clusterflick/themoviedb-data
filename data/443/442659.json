The greatest legends of jazz, from Louis Armstrong to the cool Miles Davis, are caught in some of their most passionate or private moments. Epitomizing the spirit of 1960â€™s counter-culture, a hippie plays a flute as he walks along, all his earthly belongings in a back-pack. Lost in her own thoughts for a moment, Audrey Hepburn sits pensive between takes.  Images capture the subdued beauty of a Provence winter. Like an abstract painting, the sun appears as a point of light behind a window coated thickly with frost. Modern architecture captured as an almost sci-fi fantasy - an environment so artificial that it is sublimely beautiful. All of these images came from the eye, mind and camera of Dennis Stock (1928-2010), one of the most influential chroniclers of the late 20th century.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Iconic: Photographer Dennis Stock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Stock","original_name":"Dennis Stock","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58aa0a259251411513002a43","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761414,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hanna Sawka","original_name":"Hanna Sawka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58aa0a36c3a36879180028c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761414,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hanna Sawka","original_name":"Hanna Sawka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58aa0a3ec3a36878e0002841","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1708389","wikidata_id":"Q17509665","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
