During two years, always with a camera on him, he observed and interacted with all kinds of metro 'inhabitants': passengers, bill posters, homeless persons, musicians, metro drivers, frequently conversing about life expectations. The result is a film that reveals this eclectic underground world from an unusual, irreverent and personal point of view.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/9ceP4rtAXXvbqQ6p78LxDKjaUXH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guilherme B.
