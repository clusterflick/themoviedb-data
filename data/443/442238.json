It is an existential question regarding the postmodern condition. If one looks into the contemporary arts and sciences, one will find that this may well be the case. The postmodern condition has been characterized as that of denial (Pinker), shock (Hughes), disorder (Lwoff), chaos (Bloom), dismantling (Bauman), and oblivion (Borges). Do we find ourselves in a world, like it or not, of disarray, disillusionment, even illusion? Does this inevitably lead to internal and external conflicts? We will let each viewer of our film be the judge of that\".","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mare's Nest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Gentry","original_name":"Kenneth Gentry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a759fbc3a36850da0016d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred L'Epee","original_name":"Fred L'Epee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a75a059251417900001735","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
