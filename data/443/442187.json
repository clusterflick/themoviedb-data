Hilarious misadventures begin when Max' butler, chasing a maid, breaks an expensive full-length mirror. The butler persuades the cook, who somewhat resembles Max, to stand behind the frame and be Max's reflection. This gag, developed by Max, has become a classic of film and even television borrowed by everyone from the Marx Brothers to Abbott and Costello to Red Skeleton.","popularity":0.1474,"poster_path":"/otdaobGDIuSRqsEDj8sVpdXnR4j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Max Linder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1963-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laugh with Max Linder","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Laugh with Max Linder","type":"International title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"58a70a40c3a368669d009602","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Clair","original_name":"René Clair","popularity":0.2302,"profile_path":"/m6pYOo5Yp2N4i6egvVFXYOnmS82.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrateur (voice)","credit_id":"58a70a4d925141742700a091","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","credit_id":"58a70a5e925141742b00a0da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1531273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maud Linder","original_name":"Maud Linder","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a70a579251417442009679","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0057031","wikidata_id":"Q48752219","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/otdaobGDIuSRqsEDj8sVpdXnR4j.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Ps5YglABKAvJCqImiXw82ey9z7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1963-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
