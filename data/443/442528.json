It was a sweet triumph for the man from the Gorbals, who had been raised in extreme poverty. Archive footage, animated sequences and the admiring comments of modern boxers combine to celebrate Benny’s remarkable achievements and to put his life in context. Lynch was only 33 when he died in 1946, overwhelmed by the chronic alcoholism he had been unable to defeat. Benny is an affectionate salute to the people’s champion.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Gallimore","original_name":"Andrew Gallimore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a9843692514173ee006712","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seumas MacTaggart","original_name":"Seumas MacTaggart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a9844c92514173fa0066dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Glasgow Film Festival","release_date":"2017-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
