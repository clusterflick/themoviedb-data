The documentary shows the group discussing their criteria for the band, as well as their interviews with the individual bands. It is quickly apparent that the group isn’t interested in any sort of musical talent or the potential audiences’ interest.  Rather, they are focused on ideological or moral issues that may be perceived as negative, such as groupies or outfits that are seen as too trendy. They settle on the musical group that is potentially the easiest to control, the youngest band. SELECTION works as a larger metaphor for what censorship was like in Socialist Hungary and was banned from being publicly screened until 1982.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1970-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Selection","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gyula Gazdag","original_name":"Gyula Gazdag","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/meG91qaugrEyBB1JBvwXuOOyWRg.jpg","credit_id":"58a9ae7bc3a3680b8d008b1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761272,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"János Illés","original_name":"János Illés","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0f6c8f9f37b0000f57ab09","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460892,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Péter Jankura","original_name":"Péter Jankura","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0f6c9658361b0012bfee29","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0241043","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"1970-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
