Shot like a psychological short film, it follows a man haunted by a voice from his past, wandering through a familiar street he no longer recognizes. As fragments of memory resurface, reality starts to slip. Metamorphosis dives into themes of grief, denial, and the fear of facing the truth, leading to a quiet and unsettling moment when he finds a mask. It’s a story about running away from pain, and what we become when we do.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zzPXksls1k4LFYH4JSCY6AvIGJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Till Dawn Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Dawn is finally here.","title":"Metamorphosis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5792358,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathis Davier","original_name":"Mathis Davier","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/4EEAvwjXK4Ai5nMqppA1O4DkEMK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Dawn","credit_id":"691b6ee0410f53540cc7d0fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Hazotte Maggipinto","original_name":"Nina Hazotte Maggipinto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ava","credit_id":"691b6f3b4076bb4800176102","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5792358,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathis Davier","original_name":"Mathis Davier","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/4EEAvwjXK4Ai5nMqppA1O4DkEMK.jpg","credit_id":"691b6e999706c646295e0005","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5792358,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathis Davier","original_name":"Mathis Davier","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/4EEAvwjXK4Ai5nMqppA1O4DkEMK.jpg","credit_id":"691b6eab007aae9cf25e00b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5792358,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathis Davier","original_name":"Mathis Davier","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/4EEAvwjXK4Ai5nMqppA1O4DkEMK.jpg","credit_id":"691b6eb9ab23a172ffc7d382","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5792358,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathis Davier","original_name":"Mathis Davier","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/4EEAvwjXK4Ai5nMqppA1O4DkEMK.jpg","credit_id":"691b6ec7b71b8ff3ad446d25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823200,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pablo Davier","original_name":"Pablo Davier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b6f78ce430394eb5e0075","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5819064,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gaëtan Malfroot","original_name":"Gaëtan Malfroot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b6f992364d5792881c257","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5172676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Paradis","original_name":"Emma Paradis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b70012d8ce4d41e81c2db","department":"Production","job":"Unit Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5819075,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François De Gouttes","original_name":"François De Gouttes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b7024370fc1c86c52ec1f","department":"Production","job":"Unit Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5209223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Simorre","original_name":"Paul Simorre","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b707a3f3f221395c7d173","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823239,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Alice Vincent","original_name":"Alice Vincent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b70c0ddbd01b06952ec82","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5819051,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Justin Gaillet","original_name":"Justin Gaillet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b70dcd11cb8decbc7cfea","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leny Limoux","original_name":"Leny Limoux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b711c7dd98e028c52ec8d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zzPXksls1k4LFYH4JSCY6AvIGJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Dawn -
