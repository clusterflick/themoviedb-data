Heroine Sharigan, is the lone champion of those marks, periods, commas, parentheses, and yes, apostrophes, used in writing to separate sentences and their elements, and to clarify the meaning of a communication. The story chronicles Sharigan's enlightenment, journey and eventual triumph over a culture that has become, perhaps, too desensitized to the plight of said damp punctuation. Initially challenged by and then heralded by her city's grammarians, Sharigan enlists the help of Jammy, trusted friend and confidant with a heart of gold and a mind that shatters. Sharigan and Jammy are aided by the amorphous Mr. Forleak, part James Bond, part Gerd Bonk, part Catie Rosemurgy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/buq69oAySykqYGvZPXUjbJjS3yr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tale of the Moist Apostrophe","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Blamire","original_name":"Larry Blamire","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/w5c4BLQK8uyJDO503mWWZpV7zBc.jpg","credit_id":"691a38b4ab23a172ffc7cba2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Blamire","original_name":"Larry Blamire","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/w5c4BLQK8uyJDO503mWWZpV7zBc.jpg","credit_id":"691a38c60b7ecf25d181bde6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Blamire","original_name":"Larry Blamire","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/w5c4BLQK8uyJDO503mWWZpV7zBc.jpg","credit_id":"691a38df028afab45a175ad8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Blamire","original_name":"Larry Blamire","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/w5c4BLQK8uyJDO503mWWZpV7zBc.jpg","credit_id":"691a395244b4f1a1ac6d9048","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Allen Stuart","original_name":"Mark Allen Stuart","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a39c244b1110edd609490","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12000800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1154,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/buq69oAySykqYGvZPXUjbJjS3yr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":772},{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":788,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jOvOkz1vTbHzmOYpBXAGhpcyX7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":598}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
