Disability is glazed over or not recorded in the official police reports. Nor is the fact adequately represented in the media and even in popular movement around this issue of police brutality in general. It informs us that for them, disability doesn’t matter. But clearly disability does matter, and this documentary project makes that statement loud and clear.  Where Is Hope: The Art of Murder, chronicles disabled victims murdered by police as well as the activists/artists who are fighting to end police brutality against people with disabilities. The work of many disabled activists and artists/activists are explored around this issue, especially involving disabled people of color. Notably, Director Emmitt H Thrower, is a retired NY City cop turned artist/filmmaker.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary: Mentally ill victims murdered by police brutality prompts friends, family and activists/artists with disabilities to rise-up and battle these injustices by any means necessary.","title":"Where Is Hope: The Art of Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leroy Moore Jr.","original_name":"Leroy Moore Jr.","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691be6334bce5bcab281c607","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lethea Warren","original_name":"Lethea Warren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691be64aee0dbe3606c7d381","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mesha Iriza","original_name":"Mesha Iriza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691be65ccf869c672a609b8b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalyn Hefferna","original_name":"Kalyn Hefferna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691be66e9cf4377733609bd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Jones","original_name":"Keith Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691be67844b1110edd609a79","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmitt H.
