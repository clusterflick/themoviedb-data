The Trinity test had a handful of eyewitnesses and of those just a few took part in the creation of the weapons which less than a month later would destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One of them was Roy Glauber (1925-2018). The film presents his extraordinary, personal account of those crucial events.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roy Glauber: The Bomb That Shook the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6660772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
