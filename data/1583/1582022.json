Between shouts and clean vocals, between brutal riffs and anthemic hooks, magnificent songs forge their way to the listener. Frontman Rudi Schwarzer and singer/guitarist Christoph Wieczorek complement each other perfectly, forming a wall of sound that cuts deep and resonates long after the last note fades. Live, Annisokay don't deliver a run-of-the-mill show, but rather intense moments oscillating between loss of control and clarity. For everyone who's looking for more than just noise, but still doesn't want to sacrifice volume.
