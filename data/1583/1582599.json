Serie N°1","overview":"In the 1920s, the newsreel was an essential part of the film program: it opened the evening and gave way to short films and feature films. Juan Chabalgoity, a photographer from \"el interior\", founded the San José Film Company, with which he produced five newsreels that were screened in that city and which are, to this day, the only ones of this genre in the country. Chabalgoity created a valuable repository of social, cultural, political, and historical practices, as well as of the techniques used (colouring, stop motion, animation).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":280721,"logo_path":null,"name":"San José Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1924-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Actualidades de San José.
