He wants to investigate the demise of the Golden Loom, a once-flourishing culture centered around the weaving of the sacred carpet. In its late phase, a carpet industry dominated the country until it was liberated from the all-consuming Carpet Authority and its huge factory by a catastrophe. Fabian travels to the sites of the past culture. There he meets descendants and survivors of the catastrophe. With their help, he writes his research report. An unspecified incident in his homeland prevents him from returning. By marrying a young weaver, he eventually becomes related to all the people he met during his research and becomes an employee of the local carpet museum.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hamburger Filmbüro","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Untergang des goldenen Webstuhls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franz Winzentsen","original_name":"Franz Winzentsen","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/heX5Q6NtJIYgogGmdZE7RqtsVhz.jpg","credit_id":"691b21fe1c141d759981c0c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0096346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
