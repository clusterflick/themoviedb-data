There is so much else going on there, through their nuanced mastery of sincerity, evasion and improvisation.  Chloe Swarbrick admitted at the opening for The Tomorrow People that \"politics is my performance art,\" and I believe her. The fact that a politician can be judged on how \"human\" they come across, suggests to me a divide between how politicians communicate and how everybody else does.  In making this video, I realised pretty quickly that I don't know how to speak their language. Instead, I wanted to try and translate a political message into a more domestic, intimate scale.\"  Artist's statement","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just go with me on this one","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
