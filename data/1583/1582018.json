This second anthology unravels six eerie tales rooted in the shadowed heart of La Laguna and beyond: “The Witches of Mercado Juárez”, “The Boy Who Flew Over Torreón”, “Jesús Solís, the Blind Man”, “The Goblin of Venustiano Carranza Forest”, and “La Cubana”. For the first time, the series reaches into an ancient Aztec myth with the terrifying legend of the Tzitzimimeh—celestial beings said to descend when darkness threatens the world.  From cursed markets to restless spirits and cosmic horrors, these stories expose the supernatural pulse buried within Mexico’s cultural memory. Dare to step once more into the darkness… at midnight.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/shSNJc77nj0r3DAp03PVsmzuKra.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"At Midnight Vol. 2","title":"At Midnight Vol. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2861684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Elizalde","original_name":"Ian Elizalde","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/fw230fPk0UPSXyB7lGOyzK5poFk.jpg","credit_id":"691a19e19e0edb599f877857","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anwar Safa","original_name":"Anwar Safa","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/cRFWfxSZG1xPURr6BqGF8n995uY.jpg","credit_id":"691a1a129f53be2e004ca7f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda García López","original_name":"Brenda García López","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1a39ef8e97fa7640f51f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4234751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"César Alfaro Rivera","original_name":"César Alfaro Rivera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1a9064907fabe331dae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Garza","original_name":"Victoria Garza","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1aa087eb54ced231d7aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Orozco","original_name":"Alex Orozco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1de7de8b33d4ad6d8fab","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397637,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Hernández","original_name":"Daniel Hernández","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1e97684e97806f52e67b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084059,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Zapata","original_name":"Carlos Zapata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1eb13f3f221395c7cb1b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084064,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bibian Trinidad","original_name":"Bibian Trinidad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1ebd8d7369a98a609436","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4853768,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brayan Simental","original_name":"Brayan Simental","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1ee121810ee76a175a8d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682666,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alejandro Sosa","original_name":"Alejandro Sosa","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1ef67dd98e028c52e65d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417260,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yojanan Montaño","original_name":"Yojanan Montaño","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1f22684e97806f52e68b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1829,"iso_3166_1":"MX","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/shSNJc77nj0r3DAp03PVsmzuKra.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1219}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
