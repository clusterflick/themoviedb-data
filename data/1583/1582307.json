Chroma-key utilises two cameras – the one camera omits one colour from its spectre, the other then fills it in. Blue is the best colour-key.  “Anne Bean covers up her face with a blue paint. Because the one camera doesn’t pick up blue, her features disappear bit by bit as she applies the colour. ‘Through’ her we see Eylath’s face appear, becoming ever more dominant. The dialogue is a complete agreement with this struggle between two identities.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue For You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
