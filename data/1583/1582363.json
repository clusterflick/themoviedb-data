She confides in Harrington that she feels herself destined to become a duchess, and when the news reaches the local paper, Ritzy determines to make good her ambition and insists on going to Europe. Brown induces Harrington to cure Ritzy, and the latter tells him about a friend, Algy, who can play the part of a nobleman. During the voyage, she continually throws herself in Algy's path, while she stifles her affection for Harrington. In London, Ritzy is finally made to realize the fallacy of her infatuation with titles and finds happiness with Harrington--the Duke.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ritzy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0018330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
