In the candlelit room, a nude young woman places her feet in the water as two female attendants bathe her body. Intercutting scenes show a mysterious figure starting a fire with only a hand gesture and sharpening their swords. The scene cuts back to the young woman as her attendants help her into a ceremonial robe and place a wreath of flowers on her head just as the man’s voice finishes narrating.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hptlmiFQlO1UMbltvPp0Mk73ILi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Witcher IV : Cinematic Reveal Trailer","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821288,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sebastian Kalemba","original_name":"Sebastian Kalemba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1902c5c5faff3aa0f174","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kajetan Kapuscinski","original_name":"Kajetan Kapuscinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a194f86f8f3fce7ac35df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomek Suwalski","original_name":"Tomek Suwalski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a19825ffda4900c4ca762","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_3166_1":"PL","iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/hptlmiFQlO1UMbltvPp0Mk73ILi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Witcher 4 — Cinematic Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024","key":"54dabgZJ5YA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-13T01:15:49.000Z","id":"691a1b34b83adf228eac37b0"}]}}}
