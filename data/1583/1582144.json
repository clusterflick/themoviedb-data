Stout, an art student from Winterset, Iowa, who became the leader of the Monuments Men during World War II. This group, a military special forces unit, was assigned the mission of retrieving stolen art from the Nazis.

Many of his innovations are used today to preserve masterworks from deterioration and extinction. Today, the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield continues the work of Stout L. Stout and The Monuments Men by protecting cultural heritage globally.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3F09lBxOKWO11fX9fHKVUCo9DLA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"He Rescued Stolen Nazi Art and Created a Science to Preserve It","title":"Stout Hearted: George Stout and the Guardians of Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5263448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin J.
