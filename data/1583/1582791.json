Her solitude is interrupted when a lively young boy bounds up the stairs and spots a girl on the opposite platform. Without speaking, they start a playful game of rock-paper-scissors, their laughter filling the empty station. But as the girl’s train arrives, their connection is cut short. She waves from the window, and he waves back, smiling. The elderly woman, watching from afar, is reminded that even the briefest encounters can create lasting memories of joy and shared humanity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mQXUWtb6IZp89jDGK6bQN34HrMa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock Paper Scissors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ace Ramsey","original_name":"Ace Ramsey","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"691b93c013265c5b0652ed19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alaeddin Djelllouli","original_name":"Alaeddin Djelllouli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"691b93c9c35d05db1c0b6153","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Pisapia","original_name":"Annie Pisapia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"691b93d61d8911ca60c7d1c5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Kweskin","original_name":"Alex Kweskin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b92813395c67ace6d9593","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5823520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Ward","original_name":"Lauren Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b93080c62c6cf58446d55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739507,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raven Jensen","original_name":"Raven Jensen","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b931b61a74647bf446cf4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777310,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mika Altskan","original_name":"Mika Altskan","popularity":0.1132,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b93802e365ab0c752ed8c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463117,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luca Balser","original_name":"Luca Balser","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b939113265c5b0652ed14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eléonore Hendricks","original_name":"Eléonore Hendricks","popularity":0.9628,"profile_path":"/TR81u29o3jXuaKOd3cAhuCfQM7.jpg","credit_id":"691b93a5b3e1cd51cf176110","department":"Production","job":"Casting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mQXUWtb6IZp89jDGK6bQN34HrMa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
