The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause into a single continuous presentation. The series premiered on Adult Swim on January 1, 2011, 4:00 am New Year's Day.  Hughes is a former employee of MTV Animation who first pitched it to Mike Lazzo at Adult Swim after producing a video mixtape for the network's 2010 Carnival Tour event. As a result of its 4 a.m. graveyard slot and small selection of episodes, the series remains relatively unknown on the network, but has been received positively and dubbed a cult phenomenon by critics and Adult Swim itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4DT41mcmPKUBzqIJjFQvPpcH0AH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Off the Air is an American psychedelic anthology television series created by Dave Hughes for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim.","title":"Off the Air","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":882,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4DT41mcmPKUBzqIJjFQvPpcH0AH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":588}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
