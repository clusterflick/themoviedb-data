In this case High Rollers adds a much needed layer of knowledge to the origins of radical vertical, and over-vertical, skateboarding. The skateboard boom of the 1970’s went from “sidewalk surfing” and driveway antics to aerials out of backyard swimming pools in an astonishingly short span of time. This evolutionary leap was for the most part well documented in the pages of Skateboarder Magazine and the 2001 documentary Dogtown and Z-Boyz. However, the field of vision both of these forms of media is narrow (although both are excellent), they both deal almost exclusively with what was happening in California (with occasional nods to Florida). It is understandable as skateboarding was born and given life in California, but what happened next? What was going on elsewhere?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Golden Age of Arizona Skateboarding","title":"High Rollers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Staab","original_name":"Kevin Staab","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"691aa4c69fdf7552aa5dfd34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Brannon","original_name":"Brian Brannon","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"691aa4fbe9d44ec1150b5c4f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5822154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Don Ho","original_name":"Don Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691aa3074be1fd5e715dfcba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5822155,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Albillar","original_name":"Joe Albillar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691aa32859963a83616d9206","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5822156,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Hathcote","original_name":"Mike Hathcote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691aa33c38f60e99bb52e9d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5822154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Don Ho","original_name":"Don Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691aa42d4076bb4800175d6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"High Rollers Movie Trailer December 2019","key":"uBTJG7olG1w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-03T02:42:14.000Z","id":"691aa3cb897622578a4468e5"}]}}}
