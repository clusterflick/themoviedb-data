How can one agree on a future when the past is lived so differently? Over a hundred years ago, the state forced Northern Sami to move into Southern Sami territory. Today, their descendants are fighting in court for land, reindeer herding, and the right to be Sami. The film shows how state actions continue to divide a people, and how the past continues to shape their future.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84349,"logo_path":"/f5o98Qe4RKjwlhdSlkK2ZZf9JUi.png","name":"Ten Thousand Images","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2026-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Same mot Same","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Lapp versus same","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen-Astri Lundby","original_name":"Ellen-Astri Lundby","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b66b128063141386099e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2227118,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mette Cheng Munthe-Kaas","original_name":"Mette Cheng Munthe-Kaas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b66c7cf869c672a609940","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen-Astri Lundby","original_name":"Ellen-Astri Lundby","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b66cf9487989ff46099ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":420416,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jesper Bergom-Larsson","original_name":"Jesper Bergom-Larsson","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691b66de7569f4514e52eaec","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
