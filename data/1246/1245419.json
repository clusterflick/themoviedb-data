The work reframes financial instruments as a time-travelling machine that allows the wealthy to borrow money from their future selves. It follows Philip Tose—an ex-race car driver and CEO of an insolvent company— from 1997 to 2047 as he attempts to escape the impact of the economic crash to seek a bailout from his older self. Hong Kong in 2047 is ridden with the aftereffects of Friedman’s advocacy, where economic freedom has not produced the unparalleled human freedom that he predicted but new forms of corruption. In this dystopia, preferential treatment for time-travel is given to the rich and powerful, while young “credit rating” activists demand universal access to the future.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/9AgqxgrubnH7Uh3g6K3s2NjhKmI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free to Choose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195709,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bahar Noorizadeh","original_name":"Bahar Noorizadeh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ce80b503bf840162c6073f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9AgqxgrubnH7Uh3g6K3s2NjhKmI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0NP4iADWdk1zV6Hzao8wgwc6wb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
