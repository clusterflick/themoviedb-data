Russia invades Ukraine, a war that brings back dark memories and tragic lessons from World War II. Ariane Mnouchkine, the founder of the Théâtre du Soleil who was born when war was declared in 1939, was in shock. For her, going with part of her troop to Ukraine is above all a message of solidarity and gratitude towards this people of resistance who are fighting both for their freedom but also for that of Europe. The desire of Ariane Mnouchkine and her actors is to find with Ukrainian artists, beyond differences of language and culture, a common and universal language: that of theater.","popularity":0.2123,"poster_path":"/5ywopaZ20GqKmBFzFihD3Th7OfE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kyiv Theater, An Island of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariane Mnouchkine","original_name":"Ariane Mnouchkine","popularity":0.1449,"profile_path":"/eyxBImqpcEzi9NsjmDyalRnLh5i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65cfde97f0647c017b00c165","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duccio Bellugi-Vannuccini","original_name":"Duccio Bellugi-Vannuccini","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfebab6dc5070187e1bc86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Briat","original_name":"Thomas Briat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfebbd006b010186138ab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ywopaZ20GqKmBFzFihD3Th7OfE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 5 (Aux arts et caetera)","release_date":"2024-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
