Сергій Михальчук","overview":"Before the full-scale invasion began, cinematographer Serhii Mykhalchuk was making feature films that were watched in Ukraine and around the world. His work includes about 40 films, 4 of which were nominated for an Oscar and received dozens of world awards for cinematography. However, with Russia's attack on Ukraine, Serhii Mykhalchuk's focus has completely shifted to non-fictional, real-life stories. Having picked up a camera on the first day of the invasion, he still records the events and participants of the war every day. This is the story of an artist who stood up to defend the country at a crucial moment for the country, and a warrior whose main weapon remains creativity.","popularity":0.0771,"poster_path":"/sUg420Ua8AAI3AGnd9ughgA81vP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture vs War.
