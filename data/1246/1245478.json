Teta uses Hidalgo’s narration and the footage shot by her husband to portray the ups and downs of nursing a baby as a working mother of two. As the film shows Santiago go from his first nursing session minutes after being born to his last as a walking and talking toddler, Teta illustrates the transcendent emotional bond created by nursing, not only between mother and child but between all members of the family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mfxTDvGWPkyxWBodEPwjAxz1rja.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220935,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sabana Grande Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A nursing mother tells her story.","title":"Teta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4538654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","original_name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hUIUMrkNYYTjPI2KFQWE403YIix.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65ceacd766469a017c094c35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4538654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","original_name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hUIUMrkNYYTjPI2KFQWE403YIix.jpg","credit_id":"65ceacf666469a017c094ca5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4538654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","original_name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hUIUMrkNYYTjPI2KFQWE403YIix.jpg","credit_id":"65ceae3b8efe73017b754733","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4538654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","original_name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hUIUMrkNYYTjPI2KFQWE403YIix.jpg","credit_id":"65ceaecffdf8b7018666b552","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4538654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","original_name":"Alexandra Hidalgo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hUIUMrkNYYTjPI2KFQWE403YIix.jpg","credit_id":"65ceaee2706e560179388bbb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538673,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathaniel Bowler","original_name":"Nathaniel Bowler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ceaeff6d9fe80163ce8581","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sarah Shaw","original_name":"Sarah Shaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ceaf7efdf8b7014966a8e2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538679,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jenna Ange","original_name":"Jenna Ange","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ceaf9c6d9fe80163ce86ca","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6011416","wikidata_id":"Q96407987","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mfxTDvGWPkyxWBodEPwjAxz1rja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Emotional Process of Weaning Your Baby | Documentary Clip","key":"zjgGn76vZ0w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-13T18:11:20.000Z","id":"65ceadb7c8113d014dda24b4"}]}}}
