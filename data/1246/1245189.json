A beautiful life that turns tragic. Dr. Harris (Thai \"THE THAIGA\" Edwards) returns home from work after working a double shift at the hospital to find his pregnant wife Tameka (Nicola Lambo) waiting patiently in bed. They converse for a short time highlighting the events of their day. Before going to bed Mike asks if she needed anything? Reluctantly, she tells him that she's craving ice cream. It is after 3 am, but the devotion he has for his wife and mother of their first child is far more important than his exhaustion so he goes to make a store run and on his way home one brief encounter changes their lives forever.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ice Cream Stop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13404750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
