In response to his letter, the couple decides that they will conjure up memories themselves: how they met in their early childhood, and how Jack Stevens got in timid Phillipe’s way. Or how Phillipe argued with boys who were throwing snowballs, because he wanted to defend Maud, which meant that he arrived late when visiting his antisocial mother. Or how Maud invited him to her birthday, or how Phillipe worked as a newsboy for J.Metz and used his wages to buy chocolates for Maud. Or how Jack gave the chocolates to Maud, and got into a fight with Phillipe, and finally how Maud and Philippe shared the chocolates, and kissed for the first time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When They Were Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1152376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1913-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
