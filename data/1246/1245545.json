The legacy of enslavement strips the fullness of life from those caught in its suffocating nightmare. In moving and static images, Director Charlotte Brathwaite in collaboration with Photographer Malick Welli imagine the dreams and nightmares of forcibly enslaved Muslim scholar Omar ibn Said. In shifting projections and large form photographs – the work unfolds as a cinematic ghost song that connects Said’s stolen spirit back to the living presence of his ancestors across the oceans, across time and space. FORGOTTEN PARADISE transforms the darkness of captivity into the light of knowing freedom, and loving family.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FORGOTTEN PARADISE: DREAM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Brathwaite","original_name":"Charlotte Brathwaite","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee5856d1bb201614c0706","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Brathwaite","original_name":"Charlotte Brathwaite","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee591c8113d014dda3252","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Brathwaite","original_name":"Charlotte Brathwaite","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee59cc9054f0187c42a16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539029,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Malick Welli","original_name":"Malick Welli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee5af9ac5350184dfda30","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539030,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clara Soria","original_name":"Clara Soria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee5c266469a0163096dbb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539031,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hugo Resende","original_name":"Hugo Resende","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee5d08efe7300e5757369","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195212,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tareke Ortiz","original_name":"Tareke Ortiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cee5e3c8113d0167da62f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
