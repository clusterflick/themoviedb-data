The focus is on interpersonal relationships. The school, the circle of friends, the parental home, the social milieu, the housing situation and leisure activities form the environment in which the young people find themselves on the threshold to adulthood. The film explores their wishes, thoughts, fears, dreams, hopes and conflicts. Opportunities and offers that go beyond school and can be helpful in resolving problems are also shown. It is up to the viewer to weigh up the different views of the interviewees and form their own opinion.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Junge Ehen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die FÃ¤higkeit zur Liebe oder Probleme der Anpassung","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Merz","original_name":"Eva Merz","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65cea6e452dc7f017dfa7471","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327789,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eberhard Geick","original_name":"Eberhard Geick","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cea6b552dc7f017dfa72e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538597,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ursula Bredow","original_name":"Ursula Bredow","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cea6c053f83301486a7baa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Ackermann","original_name":"Rainer Ackermann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cea68cf0647c017c7f5047","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Ackermann","original_name":"Rainer Ackermann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cea68553f83301856a8772","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4538436,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerhard Gartenbach","original_name":"Gerhard Gartenbach","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cea6d1c995ee0187601f31","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
