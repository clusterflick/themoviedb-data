So, one hopes it is engaging one’s intuition rather than, say, cognition. Coming from the world of visual art, I embrace the imperative that visual art is a sovereign language. Ideally, a person reacts to a painting free of instructions, information or intent on the part of the artist. The painting speaks to you … or it doesn’t. Information accompanying a work of art corrupts the moment one becomes engaged with the art. While i was working on you thRill me, I was thinking: “ this is either a baroque fairy tale or a drawing.“","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/84YjPsTLHf2ghg5ppubfuoq4jK3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"you thRill me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4539317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Docken","original_name":"Phil Docken","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cf354a66469a016309922d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":939,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84YjPsTLHf2ghg5ppubfuoq4jK3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
