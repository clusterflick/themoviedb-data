This documentary, produced and written by John Peer Nugent and narrated by notable urbanist William H. Whyte, was released on public television to provide a behind-the-scenes peek at the planning process. There's a lot that is gone from contemporary New York in this documentary: a gritty Hell's Kitchen, a robust Model Cities program, and acres of slums in Bedford-Stuyvesant. But there's a lot that, for better or worse, is still the same: poverty and prosperity, diversity and wealth, greed and good intentions.","popularity":0.1613,"poster_path":"/u6P57OvChoKxbVhFx0jgA0QHnH0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Is The City But The People?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William H.
