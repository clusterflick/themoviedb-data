This totalitarian State run by a ruthless Overlord, is ever looking to expand its rule and stake its voracious appetite for the world's most precious resources wherever or whatever they may be. From the wastelands comes Grifter Logan - a lone wanderer who some believe is the key to the Federation's ultimate destruction, foretold in bygone prophesies. The Overlord is well aware that as one-by-one the omens are coming to pass, not just the survival of the Federation is at stake, so is his very own. Equally determined to protect the Chosen One and guide him to his ultimate fate is an ambitious Wizard, for whom the destruction of the Federation is not just a moral cause; it's a personal one.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/18EnHVwMf4LUTkKsV0X7qAN2G8V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gunslinger Grifter Logan","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1357413","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/18EnHVwMf4LUTkKsV0X7qAN2G8V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
