The film toggles between the scales of the granular and microscopic to the vast and planetary. United in this collage of found and re-animated footage, one finds: an analog countdown from the start of a film reel, sun spots, magnetic field disturbances, and an overheard conversation. The film is created using an ink-jet direct-on-film technique where the digital frame is printed directly onto recycled 16mm celluloid.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/8wz2XhrzPYsW2I5OqptxboaWtYG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solar Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3315171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Vlasova","original_name":"Masha Vlasova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ce4aa06c0b3601628dfe52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8wz2XhrzPYsW2I5OqptxboaWtYG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
