But little known to anyone, other than Hopper and a handful of his buddies, he had another agenda entirely. While he did indeed screen his movie, Hopper had actually come to Houston to blow himself up.  After screening his movie Out Of The Blue, Hopper arranged to have the audience driven by a fleet of school buses to a racetrack on the outskirts of Houston, the Big H Speedway. Hopper and the buses arrived at the speedway just as the races were ending and a voice was announcing over the public address system 'stick around folks and watch a famous Hollywood film personality perform the Russian Dynamite Death Chair Act. That’s right, folks, he’ll sit in a chair with six sticks of dynamite and light the fuse.  'The large guy making the sign of the cross is the writer Terry Southern and the jerk threatening to blow up my camera is the German filmmaker, Wim Wenders.'","popularity":0.3295,"poster_path":"/nqOYiJzVnXO6oBgCvTjPETKfVwb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dennis Hopper's Russian Dynamite Death Chair Act","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Hopper","original_name":"Dennis Hopper","popularity":1.2061,"profile_path":"/kqyNvLHi5RZGZcZMxl7e6XvoB5U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65ceae1260c7510162689358","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terry Southern","original_name":"Terry Southern","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/zvaYee6lkHqjLE47IHPZfUWijSS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65ceae38fdf8b7018666b28c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Wenders","original_name":"Wim Wenders","popularity":1.0062,"profile_path":"/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65ceae4066469a0130093c5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4075688,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Olie Anderson","original_name":"Olie Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67d7c14c31538de608f1cf90","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Huberman","original_name":"Brian Huberman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ceae6c8efe7300e5753cd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqOYiJzVnXO6oBgCvTjPETKfVwb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
