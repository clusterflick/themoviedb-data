In this major center of Eastern Orthodox monasticism men still try to do things in common. The sounding boards and the bells, the voices of the monks chanting sweeten the soul of man. Divine music, next to it Byzantine iconography. The most mystic period in the history of art. Manuel Panselinos, Thophanis Strelitzas or Bathas and a number of other great painters. Nature guileless and innocent. The garden of the only woman who is venerated here: The Holy Virgin. At the summit of Athos we realized how much this pilgrimage had changed us. We found ourselves in a place nurtured by benediction and blessing is never absent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gfF1r4SVHfNoIm7YBNLEx1pxSBO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1999-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passages through Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4540485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiannis Lambrou","original_name":"Yiannis Lambrou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfcd43fe5c91017bc19e1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0363878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gfF1r4SVHfNoIm7YBNLEx1pxSBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
