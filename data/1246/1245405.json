Костянтин та Влада Ліберови","overview":"Before the full-scale invasion, a couple from Odesa, Kostiantyn and Vlada Liberov, were successful photographers: they photographed couples in love, held master classes and taught the art of photography. But after February 24, 2022, they radically changed the vector of their work: they began to work as documentary photographers in the hottest spots of the war. Their photos are striking, poignant, terrifying, and no one will be left unmoved by them. The works of Kostiantyn and Vlada have traveled all over the world, they are shared by thousands of users on social networks and published by the largest international media, including BBC, Associated Press, Welt, Vogue and Forbes. Photography became their weapon in the fight against the enemy.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/xm7TyUlatRINacOJhD5zQPanH25.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture vs War.
