It is a medium that has all too often sought to control, define and dictate perceptions of ”other” places. Comprised of footage shot while travelling on group excursions across Russia in 2019, An Uncountable Number of Threads is an attempt to draw out the ethical restrictions of a travelogue, while questioning how (and why) to make one. At times there is an awkward tourist-gaze, aware of its outsider position. But as a self-reflexive work that considers its own creation, it ultimately unravels, as the artist rationalises themselves out of a particular way of working, inviting the viewer into their uncertainty.﻿﻿","popularity":0.4037,"poster_path":"/fPd17i6NmP6i7KwmxeqpFLneeEz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Uncountable Number of Threads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cf1d778efe730162755075","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cf1d5e873f00018a0d38fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cf1d81706e560179393ecb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fPd17i6NmP6i7KwmxeqpFLneeEz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195239,"name":"travelogue"},{"id":211062,"name":"ethics"},{"id":230967,"name":"self-reflexive"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":328788,"name":"film making"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
