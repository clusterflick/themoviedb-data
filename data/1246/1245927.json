Her photographs are items of evidence through which she tells stories that are both ordinary and disturbing, using her own life and experiences as the raw material for reconstructions that hover somewhere between truth and fiction.\r The Contacts collection is an invitation to discover the artistic approach of the greatest contemporary photographers from an original angle. Through a series of images (contact sheets, proofs, prints and slides), with a commentary by the photographer, the viewer enters the secret world of their creation and is guided into the heart of the photographic creative process.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/82xPwI2AGaVR0rFcrRvqdQH3rjP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre National de la Photographie","origin_country":""},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":40545,"logo_path":null,"name":"KS Visions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contacts: Sophie Calle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Sophie Calle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Calle","original_name":"Sophie Calle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/CxxMIiAkHrjcW1o1wiWu0Ar39t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65cfe8a61b722c017bc91ee3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Krief","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Krief","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfe97a323eba017c3606cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Klein","original_name":"William Klein","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/5SLqYqn6i0KjLXWkl3tvPurMv0R.jpg","credit_id":"65cfe9be6dc5070187e1bb24","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/82xPwI2AGaVR0rFcrRvqdQH3rjP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
