I like Foucault's work because it emphasizes how dialogue can change internal and external lives. The idea for this video piece came to me when I was browsing through Hogarth’s prints, one depicting an 18th century asylum visit. I imagined a different character in the image, someone subjected to psychiatric \"help\" because of being gay. It is wonderful to see pseudo-scientific notions about gender, sexuality and identity recede into the past, being replaced by the freedom of expression.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rVg59ptOY2gr1UrFYe0TCQv6XEh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Gart","original_name":"Anne Gart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65cd63e6efcea9017ca9c2a5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Gart","original_name":"Anne Gart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd63f1efcea9017ca9c2db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Gart","original_name":"Anne Gart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd63fbb046050183d9e878","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Gart","original_name":"Anne Gart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd63dac26796017ec862fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rVg59ptOY2gr1UrFYe0TCQv6XEh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
