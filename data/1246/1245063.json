At breaking point, he gives into his inner desires and begins to dance, or perhaps fly. Will the school's janitor accept him, and can he find the strength to accept himself? Echoing the harm caused by Section 28, this trans-led film explores a crisis of identity, finding joy and queer acceptance through dance.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/35dvllAdAtuMRdQjvHf98UL4xu2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"School Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matias Boyd-Moss","original_name":"Matias Boyd-Moss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65cd5b8a99259c014a24f0cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2190329,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonathan Goddard","original_name":"Jonathan Goddard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65cd5b9687f3f2017bf44643","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4212207,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Quentin Corker-Marin","original_name":"Quentin Corker-Marin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd5b4d312345017bba1d08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Marrington-Reeve","original_name":"Felix Marrington-Reeve","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd5b7099259c016324fe25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4212207,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Quentin Corker-Marin","original_name":"Quentin Corker-Marin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd5b59efcea9017ca9a665","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Connor Wakefield","original_name":"Connor Wakefield","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd5b7c51e6ab01631ee6eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4212207,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Quentin Corker-Marin","original_name":"Quentin Corker-Marin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cd5b656c0b3601628d5f46","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/35dvllAdAtuMRdQjvHf98UL4xu2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
