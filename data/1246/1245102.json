When she's diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 36, she starts to interrogate the way we diagnose and treat cancer by digging into the statistics to ask whether we are making the right choices in how we treat this disease. Are we sometimes too quick to screen and treat cancer? Do doctors always speak to us honestly about the subject? It may seem like a dangerous question to ask, but are we at risk of overmedicalizing cancer? At the same time, Hannah records her own cancer journey in raw and emotional personal footage, where the realities of life after a cancer diagnosis are laid bare.","popularity":0.1451,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making Sense of Cancer with Hannah Fry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vLgCunyVCPYr0DzOODybHAtBuR3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8bVWeEPkPS5FsBkGbvN9ViMCrmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
