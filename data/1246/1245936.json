The construction of the Transamazonia generated industries around the extraction of natural resources like metal, wood, and rubber. In this film, these materials are used to build a dolly and tracks to realise a travelling shot upon this road. Through the realisation of this camera movement, which re-enacts the idealism of the Transamazonian project, this film addresses the processes and pioneering ideas invoked by the Brazilian military dictatorship in the building of this highway.","popularity":0.1094,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travelling Amazonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marine Hugonnier","original_name":"Marine Hugonnier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfed82f1759c0148fba0c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marine Hugonnier","original_name":"Marine Hugonnier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfed908c315901856c10e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4540683,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roberto Thome De Oliviera Filho","original_name":"Roberto Thome De Oliviera Filho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfeda6afa1b00185c4cfca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300511,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Helle le Fevre","original_name":"Helle le Fevre","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfee0eafa1b00149c4cced","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
