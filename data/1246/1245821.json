Concerned and loving parents talk about their educational experiences, educational discussions and their trust in their own children. Certain character ideas of the parents of boyfriends and girlfriends, which are rarely accepted by the young people, contradict the open statements of the teenagers in front of the camera. Questions about contraception and the uncontrolled leisure activities of the pubescent pupils are included in the interviews, and their answers do not always correspond to their parents' ideas. During the final class trip to a youth hostel, the teachers in charge have their hands full keeping the teenagers under control and returning them safely to their parents' homes. Lydia talks openly about her \"first time\", but her parents are surprised to learn about their sheltered daughter's love affair via a tape recording.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/bGdWXis14Y9ydAByz8GRhYMh63U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Eltern und der erste Freund","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3571971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helmut Kißling","original_name":"Helmut Kißling","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/vpoE0HaOKSsrxEcATPD83ywYHgR.jpg","credit_id":"65cfaec166469a017c0a86b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3571971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helmut Kißling","original_name":"Helmut Kißling","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/vpoE0HaOKSsrxEcATPD83ywYHgR.jpg","credit_id":"65cfaec89ac5350184e0ad65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962466,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hans Borrmann","original_name":"Hans Borrmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfaed2873f0001670d51ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4540256,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sahleh","original_name":"Sahleh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfaede66469a017c0a86d3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560437,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dieter Beckert","original_name":"Dieter Beckert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfaee966469a016309c5eb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bGdWXis14Y9ydAByz8GRhYMh63U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
