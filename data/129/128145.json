So the next morning after David goes to work, Cassie runs off to her sister's house for a few days with their daughter Samantha. Only they never get there. David starts looking for them, and her sister, Joanne, thinks David had something to do with their disappearance, and calls the police. Actually Samantha and Cassie are with Roy and Georgina Scudder, and their daughter Jill. Roy picked them up after their car broke down. The only problem is, the Scudders, who seem a little odd at first, won't let them leave or call anyone.","popularity":1.9539,"poster_path":"/dp3pGEUiLqxb9IaCCWXD4iOBUJ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4063,"logo_path":"/psOuT9ReSYhcBEB5ptnw7D2FdsE.png","name":"Trimark
