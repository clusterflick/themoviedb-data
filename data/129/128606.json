Carrington recruits former cavalry scouts Jim Bridger and \"Dakota Jack\" Gaines to lead the project. Bridger and Gaines are friendly with Sioux chief Red Cloud, and they feel a peace treaty with the Indians can be made. If an Indian-war breaks out, the cavalry is depending on getting a new type of Springfield rifle. Bridger, Gaines and Gaines wife, Maxine, arrive at the fort for the conference. Gaines, in a drunken fit, tries to intimidate the Indians unto signing a treaty. Chied Red Fox threatens war if his territory is invaded by any troops building forts.","popularity":1.4773,"poster_path":"/lO7MivunhPpnCyvrcWFkNjGjk0r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clover Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When a new kind of weapon wrote history in the Old West!","title":"The Gun That Won the West","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Morgan","original_name":"Dennis Morgan","popularity":2.7339,"profile_path":"/5yfGLf697VUrsDIhrVnAtVP7ftx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jim Bridger","credit_id":"52fe4b22c3a368484e1798b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Raymond","original_name":"Paula Raymond","popularity":0.4658,"profile_path":"/lrd2Sm6kn6OWtOmTDnRYctqQxbZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Max Gaines","credit_id":"52fe4b22c3a368484e1798bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Denning","original_name":"Richard Denning","popularity":0.5001,"profile_path":"/xBDoxyNeRyi4uOvnH2OsmkvJQYi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"'Dakota' Jack Gaines","credit_id":"52fe4b22c3a368484e1798bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris O'Brien","original_name":"Chris O'Brien","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Sgt.
