In 2002, Phyllis Diller announced that she would be hanging up her wigs and sequins after 47 years on the road. This film captures a never-before-seen, intimate look at a trailblazer for both women and comedy. Miss Diller provides unprecedented access to her preparations for her final performance at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.  This is a revealing and personal study of the art of stand-up comedy as told by an icon and a true comedic genius.","popularity":2.3986,"poster_path":"/mwx3azv4QGBZdAcCHeZambOVDvY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
