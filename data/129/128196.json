The long-running Warped Tour (nine years as of this DVD production) is an annual mosaic of state-of-the-art punk rock, a road show featuring 17 or so acts in various stages of artistic development.  Shot in summer 2002, Live features the barefoot, chummy excitement of piano-centered Something Corporate, some first-rate (even vaguely melodic) thrashing on Anti-Flag's \"Got the Numbers,\" galloping folk-punk from Ireland's Flogging Molly, and Reel Big Fish's crisp ska with a Coasters-like sense of humor. The tour's handful of veteran acts--Mighty Mighty Bosstones, NOFX, and Bad Religion among Them--are the tent poles of Vans' moveable feast, and they don't let the rain-soaked crowd down. Breathtaking extras include a visit to the tour's biker-mad Moto-X Park and the half-pipe at the pro BMX skate park.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/l2pvMtXlLOKOfzYY2GmVarHHIFG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warped Tour 2002","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2pvMtXlLOKOfzYY2GmVarHHIFG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
