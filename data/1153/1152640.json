Looking for a gift for his little sister, Mike comes across a clown doll at a small corner store. He purchases the doll and goes back home to begin setting up for his Halloween party with his friends. At Mike's party, the body count begins and it soon becomes clear that the doll has plans for Mike's party guests, and fun is NOT on the menu.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/OKJdooDp36DCTrL7BIUT5l4zif.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jester","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dustin Ferguson","original_name":"Dustin Ferguson","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b37377378062013906e1ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OKJdooDp36DCTrL7BIUT5l4zif.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
