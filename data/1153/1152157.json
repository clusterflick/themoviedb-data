He picks it up and plays with it as he walks. Security cameras follow him. Near the school entrance, one of his teachers confiscates it, and the teacher, in turn, has it taken from him by two Israeli soldiers. We follow the toy, as do the omnipresent security cameras, into the hands of a caf√© owner, and then to a Japanese tourist, a nun, an Orthodox boy, and more. Its very presence, with its lights and beeps, causes suspicion and sometimes alarm. Is this a world in which it's unsafe to carry a toy?","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":"/qHtn8ZBFkd10RNK6zwsDa3Ow1M4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Toy","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Abu Sal'oum","original_name":"Ahmad Abu Sal'oum","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ahmed Abo Salem","credit_id":"64b19f02a3b5e600e23f36af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhamed Eliwat","original_name":"Muhamed Eliwat","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64b19f0e23d27800e88a6711","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Giron","original_name":"Jonathan Giron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64b19f1578570e00ad4ab568","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shlomi Hayun","original_name":"Shlomi Hayun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64b19f1f37806200ff37f026","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mako Otomo","original_name":"Mako Otomo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64b19f270bb07600eb282aba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1075508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renana Raz","original_name":"Renana Raz","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":"/65G8ffykurxZlZMF2P30ZcrIsof.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64b19f2f37806200e2aa3bc0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2087718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dani Rosenberg","original_name":"Dani Rosenberg","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b19eeb1684f7011e76a49a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2087718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dani Rosenberg","original_name":"Dani Rosenberg","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b19ee20e4fc8011e058a48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomer Shani","original_name":"Tomer Shani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b19f570bb076014e4e03ea","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amnon Schwarz","original_name":"Amnon Schwarz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b19f42e0ca7f01253c4774","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162611,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gil Asheri","original_name":"Gil Asheri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b19f76e0ca7f00ae74c182","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1011135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadav Lapid","original_name":"Nadav Lapid","popularity":0.3021,"profile_path":"/w2d3Wty19GGOEhN7CqlSdvLQxIq.jpg","credit_id":"64b19f6ba3b5e600add1474a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0477977","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/qHtn8ZBFkd10RNK6zwsDa3Ow1M4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
