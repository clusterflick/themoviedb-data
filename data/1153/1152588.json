Helen Marsden, daughter of a wealthy senator who is interested in prison reform, prevails on the judge to parole them into her custody and work at her ranch. Frank falls in love and, so as to stay on at the ranch, convinces her he is a notorious criminal. When the senator visits her with a large sum of money belonging to the state, three \"reformed\" crooks on the premises plan to steal it. Fortune's friends learn of the plot and decide to take the money for safekeeping, but Fortune intervenes; the real crooks do steal the funds, however, and depart with Helen in an automobile. Fortune overtakes the speeding car and rescues Helen.","popularity":0.4275,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Wells","original_name":"Ted Wells","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/5j3mv4E4dRov53LiK08bYIrSsP9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Frank Fortune","credit_id":"64b32174e0ca7f00c8ce4835","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2514877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotus Thompson","original_name":"Lotus Thompson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/myepMO2TL05mgqkwHVOc8BggEIY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helen Marsden","credit_id":"64b3218c37806200c586f9a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Gordon","original_name":"Bruce Gordon","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/qTyqhTYbKYFbbiEdZAwSKHScxaL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Butch Rorke","credit_id":"64b3330c0cb33500e2bc53ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Phillips","original_name":"Jimmy Phillips","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Rat","credit_id":"64b3332c0cb335011cb1f0e8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2356729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Cole","original_name":"Slim Cole","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Parson","credit_id":"64b3335ee0ca7f00e771c5f1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ovey","original_name":"George Ovey","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/6is2ebdbjrQzsoksjFyUWZcijJL.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Shorty Benton","credit_id":"64b333960e4fc800e33532b4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard L'Estrange","original_name":"Richard L'Estrange","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/ubM9lTn9d14Zvhkl2o9PYluIOvU.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Slim Donovan","credit_id":"64b333c20bb07600eb28e37e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710288,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David S.
