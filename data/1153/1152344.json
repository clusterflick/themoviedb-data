Abandoned in a labyrinthine island, the childlike minotaur has as his only companion a playful red ball and a multitude of mirrors. When he sees his own image he imagines himself dancing in perfect synchronicity with a mysterious other. But new characters are brought to the island, and they don't behave like his choreographed twins. Confused and frustrated, the creature has to learn to adapt to a world of uncertainty. But when he can't, the monster's true nature is revealed. Most of the character animation was originally hand-drawn on a light table, cut out and mounted on rigid cardboard. This was done so that each replacement could stand up vertically within a three-dimensional set. The set was then lit with fibre-optic lights and shot in stop-motion, using a 16mm Bolex camera. Some of the animation was done as hinged cut-out puppets on glass, using a multi-plane rig.","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":"/lbFGnA5i7M8LYwjzmkHtXHSZGm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minotaur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Sousa","original_name":"Daniel Sousa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/1e76ZxjIxvRLEHjAsKRLQQ7MZMV.jpg","credit_id":"64b25eda0bb07600ae3b871f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0288119","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1675,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lbFGnA5i7M8LYwjzmkHtXHSZGm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1113},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xAMWaSYaTL1BTCc6QJ3UxCBjpAp.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7NpSQTM93UjkYoy4kTLowtqR0vU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
