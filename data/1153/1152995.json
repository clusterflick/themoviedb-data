After Sultan's death Karma decides to teach the villagers to defend themselves but is typecast as a rebel, arrested by the Police, and held in a cell. Ranga abducts a young lad, names him Ranga, and trains him to be a bandit. After Ranga passes away, the younger Ranga, mesmerized by the evil Ginnibai, takes over.
