Navigating between the sadness of memories, the melancholy of oblivion and absence, she reflects. Pain, necessary at some point, cannot be the only thing that guides her through grief. It exists, but the possibility of transformation is also there. In her search, she discovers that healing means leaving behind. To forget would be to evade, but to go through and overcome the past opens up space to love others and herself.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/7QHPk3HURoLF3l4DxUfOMGno1Ft.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Things I've Never Said","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164612,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Carolina Segarra","original_name":"Carolina Segarra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b303330e4fc800e3352612","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4034107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Florencia Boetsch","original_name":"Florencia Boetsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302c1e0ca7f00e771b70f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Monsalvo","original_name":"Sol Monsalvo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302a4378062011c8b0e80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3983515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván Cardozo","original_name":"Iván Cardozo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302e20e4fc800e33525f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164611,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Micaela Elia","original_name":"Micaela Elia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b30310c8a2d400c622a986","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Monsalvo","original_name":"Sol Monsalvo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302ab37806200ff38a770","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4034107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Florencia Boetsch","original_name":"Florencia Boetsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302cf0e4fc8011e063ac1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164612,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Carolina Segarra","original_name":"Carolina Segarra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b303240e4fc800c683800d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sol Monsalvo","original_name":"Sol Monsalvo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b3029ec8a2d400ae77db01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164609,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Camila Fardella","original_name":"Camila Fardella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302f823d27801261a1b9d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4034107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Florencia Boetsch","original_name":"Florencia Boetsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b302c9e0ca7f0106975cd6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4164614,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Camila Ataide","original_name":"Camila Ataide","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b303460e4fc800e335261e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"avavava.ava","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7QHPk3HURoLF3l4DxUfOMGno1Ft.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
