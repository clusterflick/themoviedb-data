He emerges from the sewers one day to dance in the streets and is immediately thrown into jail. There, the Sims study him in a dungeon reminiscent of that in \"Brazil\" and populated with other Freaks. He is given two pictures to choose from # a normal one and a freakish one. Of course, \"The Freak\" always chooses the freakish one, and because of this he is thrown into a padded cell.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/2PIN3CdTtHfKmmrl5ZYQLT2mrgk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3223,"logo_path":null,"name":"MeniThings Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's Happy, He's Different, He's In BIG Trouble...","title":"The Freak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aristomenis Tsirbas","original_name":"Aristomenis Tsirbas","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/necVozJDvoFJyzFRNyK7fiL1DkT.jpg","credit_id":"64b45a4337806200c5878710","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aristomenis Tsirbas","original_name":"Aristomenis Tsirbas","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/necVozJDvoFJyzFRNyK7fiL1DkT.jpg","credit_id":"64b45a4be0ca7f00e7725483","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0343683","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2RjXsWnHNu68qtiwn1GBJdPAkNh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2PIN3CdTtHfKmmrl5ZYQLT2mrgk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hollywood Film Festival","release_date":"2002-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
