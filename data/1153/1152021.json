In this film, Van Gasteren makes use of elements of Soviet cinema and the French nouvelle vague.  In the ’50s, Rotterdam-based contractor Dura built a factory in the Eemhaven district where prefab components for whole blocks of residential buildings could be produced. Together with architect Ernest Groosman, a proponent of reconstruction architecture, Dura built homes at various locations in the Rotterdam area. The building of these ‘Groosman flats’ is shown at a construction site in Rotterdam’s Lombardijen district, accompanied by cheerful jazz music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wRbFjyhCMjoJquY8EdeVwlIinPf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Birds Have Nests...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wim Povel","original_name":"Wim Povel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64b15dc89672ed00c6c98f27","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis van Gasteren","original_name":"Louis van Gasteren","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/vlQEikWPOQFRUq8ZDxLwGb5cfhR.jpg","credit_id":"64b15d89d236e600c5870eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wRbFjyhCMjoJquY8EdeVwlIinPf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
