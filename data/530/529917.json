Is he the greatest villain in English history, or the victim of centuries of grotesquely unfair Tudor propaganda? On the eve of Richard's reburial at Leicester Cathedral, this drama documentary assembles a stellar cast of experts, including David Starkey and Philippa Gregory, to examine all the available evidence. As it plays out the possibilities and tests the competing theories, it endeavors to get to the bottom, once and for all, of what really happened to the princes in the Tower. Is this a tale of naked ambition, cold pragmatism and bloody murder?","popularity":0.6163,"poster_path":"/luV6UK3yYi6YhTuDJv3H3CyEqN1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard III: The Princes in the Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Dooley","original_name":"Shaun Dooley","popularity":0.998,"profile_path":"/uWiw28ARiLkvL6xUjKDLDlSsfkY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66e7247ce8211ecd22b0a815","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1193021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Crossen","original_name":"Sabine Crossen","popularity":0.373,"profile_path":"/dNqU5xiCzrq615ezdWeGJmSX0Vc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Queen Elizabeth Woodville","credit_id":"5b21d27b9251416e4b0162d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71571,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippa Gregory","original_name":"Philippa Gregory","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":"/xzXrtl1mdSPUsOJuhJ7DoNOs7Nk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5b21d2a2c3a3687b4b010a89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Starkey","original_name":"David Starkey","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/5HeTTgMJopMKfE7iz5NLtKAi0ok.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b21d2b20e0a264d95014072","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Harrison","original_name":"Nigel Harrison","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/2Qj4q8fcyd08yyr1QU7WDpFiRlb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Lord Hastings","credit_id":"67eb34bcb0a9ac74158bdf46","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258236,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas Kent","original_name":"Nicolas Kent","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b21d30c9251416e4b016307","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Jones","original_name":"Susan Jones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b21d2f70e0a264dae01351f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064143,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Adams","original_name":"Thomas Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b21d31d9251416e2e014a1a","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ashley Gething","original_name":"Ashley Gething","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b21d2c49251416e0b01044a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ashley Gething","original_name":"Ashley Gething","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7c2cf7c3a368197e00ff9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4543638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54U3viAopOkA6nOTCVyiNY5TNnN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/luV6UK3yYi6YhTuDJv3H3CyEqN1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235489,"name":"medieval england"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
