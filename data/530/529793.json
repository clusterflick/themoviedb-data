Set in present day Brunei, Amin (KAI ANWAR) a quirky, London-based ex-pat with a penchant for yellow umbrellas, returns to his childhood home to settle the legal affairs of his recently deceased parents. The momentous homecoming takes a dramatic twist when he encounters his venerable former neighbor Bakar (SHAFIEE MOSTAR) a retired Fire Chief with a chip on his shoulder. Sparks soon fly as these two engage in a battle of one-upmanship of comic proportions. But when unexpected tragedy strikes, the two men join forces, forming an unlikely friendship that proves despite their differences they truly get on like a house on fire. Featuring 100% Bruneian talent, this humorous heart warming tale reaffirms the power of community, difficulties of change and the importance of family,especially during the four Sundays of Puasa.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jYFABqD0FjkH8lCxNX6cB54Sjgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BN","name":"Brunei Darussalam"}],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fourth Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2063612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Anwar","original_name":"Kai Anwar","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b20fed7c3a36813d500c760","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2063613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shafiee Mostar","original_name":"Shafiee Mostar","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b20fee2c3a36813d500c767","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2063615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liyana Yus","original_name":"Liyana Yus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xPoFsxVkAXMX8v7eBHVjguU46ed.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b20feec0e0a264dae00b966","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2063617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Zulkifli","original_name":"Ian Zulkifli","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b20fef70e0a264d9500c393","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2063610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siti Kamaluddin","original_name":"Siti Kamaluddin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b20febfc3a36813ad00f1cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8686060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Hari-Minggu-Yang-Ke-Empat-2058474894478328","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jYFABqD0FjkH8lCxNX6cB54Sjgb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ms","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hari Minggu Yang Ke- Empat","key":"YMav9cl8m60","published_at":"2018-06-07T06:34:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b20fe809251416e1e00b8ed"}]}}}
