Across 22 different tableaus the film meditates upon the interiors of Nevada’s wedding chapels, considering how the excessive scenery opens up to constitute a cultural organisation of “Love”. A woman’s’ voice is heard reading out an ambiguous letter to an unknown lover in which she finds herself troubled by the challenges of modern relationships, unable to negotiate a balance between self-fulfilment and optimization.  The text is based on anonymous posts by different women in various internet wedding forums. One fictional female character is composed out of many assembled perspectives on desire, relationships and social expectation.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert Miracles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2215488,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Kochmann","original_name":"Christian Kochmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7M3rnEkDZK5QM79aQfcb5zyctdx.jpg","credit_id":"6342b444b18f3200797e3ad7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1676987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miriam Gossing","original_name":"Miriam Gossing","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b226623c3a36813c301a583","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1676986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lina Sieckmann","original_name":"Lina Sieckmann","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b22662c9251416e2a017b61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
