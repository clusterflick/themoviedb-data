Detroit's family has had only 2 Dons, the current boss has served for 30 years and is the longest serving mob Don in America. The documentary consists of interviews with multiple FBI agents and Federal prosecutors as well as several mafia associates from the 1950's and 1960's. Topics such as the Detroit \"Combination's\" (as the Family is known) infiltration of Las Vegas casinos and their centrality to the disapearance of Jimmy Hoffa are discussed.","popularity":0.4742,"poster_path":"/qkzgHgvwBBOLtnVrsSp13jhG5EK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio August Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detroit Mob Confidential","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2064102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott M.
