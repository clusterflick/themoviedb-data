When she pays a home visit to a bubbly gay couple (Ricky and Martin) who are seeking De Facto visa status a hidden agenda becomes apparent, causing Lara to reevaluate her own life and make some big decisions. \"Vis à Vis\" is a bittersweet, topical, offbeat comedy that looks at the choices we make, and the lengths we go to, for the ones we
