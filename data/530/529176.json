The huge but graceful wrestlers proceed with precision and great formality through the elaborate ceremonies and ornamentation. That doesn't stop crowds from going wild as the two huge wrestlers dressed only in loincloths battle each other.\r There is nothing crude about the fight; it proceeds in a series of infinitesimal moves made with as much power as the individual wrestler can summon. When one wrestler's foot is out of the ring, or any part of his body touches the ground, the other has won. A bout rarely lasts even a minute. Japanese schoolboys learn Sumo as their North American peers learn hockey and baseball.","popularity":0.21,"poster_path":"/6JSiC1ZE5sGXjYk2KeiGzik3Iwv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Sumo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6JSiC1ZE5sGXjYk2KeiGzik3Iwv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1052}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":168929,"name":"sumo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
