Bernard Eisenschitz, who was involved with Luce Vigo (daughter of Jean Vigo) in the 1990 reconstruction of this masterwork, takes us into the raw materials by which this complex film was re-envisioned and continues to be analyzed and changed today. An important vision of film as a tradition of viewership, curation and exploration.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/bokuISbefWfBizQwSOEzTcbgVCC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Shooting: L'Atalante - Rushes and Outtakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Winter Shooting: L’Atalante - Rushes and Outtakes","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Tournage d’hiver: L’Atalante de Jean Vigo chutes et rushes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Eisenschitz","original_name":"Bernard Eisenschitz","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"5b2262fd0e0a264d8a019966","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Eisenschitz","original_name":"Bernard Eisenschitz","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9d4e1b4772150041032079","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bokuISbefWfBizQwSOEzTcbgVCC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
