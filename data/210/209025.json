Based on the latest research, this dramatised documentary reveals how around 70 men armed themselves with kitchen knives and roasting spits, and chose a man called Spartacus as their leader. People came to join them in their thousands, and within a matter of months, the fugitive band was an army 100,000 strong. Strong enough to threaten the destruction of Rome. This film tells the story of a modern, dirty war of propaganda, psychological warfare and guerrilla tactics fought two thousand years ago. And it reveals the true character of Spartacus, a ruthless and charismatic leader very different to the figure created by two thousand years of myth-making.","popularity":0.2915,"poster_path":"/vEpiXfysFE104jPKtw8jEJW1vun.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spartacus: Gladiator War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Oliver","original_name":"Dan Oliver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d59c3a368484e1e4415","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1038086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vEpiXfysFE104jPKtw8jEJW1vun.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":588,"name":"rome, italy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
