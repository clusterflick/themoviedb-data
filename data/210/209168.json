During these years, thousands of people were kidnapped and murdered with impunity. In many cases, the state appropriated the newborns of pregnant women at the time of his abduction. The disappearance of 500 children is one of the darkest legacies of this period. However, the tireless work of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo became possible that a hundred of these children were returned to their families.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":"/wWko31CnX43fGI2wPTSnPw4nCvm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2004-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nietos (Identidad y memoria)","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Arscuchin","original_name":"Raquel Arscuchin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e5225","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leticia Baibiene","original_name":"Leticia Baibiene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e5229","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Luisa Bertrans de Barahona","original_name":"María Luisa Bertrans de Barahona","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e522d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Blanco","original_name":"Luisa Blanco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e5231","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delia Califano","original_name":"Delia Califano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e5235","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Matías Cevasco","original_name":"Gabriel Matías Cevasco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e5239","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamín Ávila","original_name":"Benjamín Ávila","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/qOOVh937ViL2KfEZZlqIsL6yhhr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d5dc3a368484e1e5221","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417012","wikidata_id":"Q6042780","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWko31CnX43fGI2wPTSnPw4nCvm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nietos - Identidad y memoria","key":"0nw7haWfG-A","published_at":"2008-11-18T02:44:17.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec715c3a368544800adb4"}]}}}
