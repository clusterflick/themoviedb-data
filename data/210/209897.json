Remembering the excitement of an artist or DJ \"in action\" is the key component for longevity because through our memory it is often how we measure an eventâ€™s effectiveness. In addition to simulating the artist and/or DJ, this DVD provides an array of features that will be discovered, explored and expanded upon.  All mix segments were filmed in Detroit, USA. A DJ setup and lighting were created to simulate the authentic look and stereo sound of a DJ in a club DJ booth. A black backdrop behind Jeff Mills was used so that the reprogramming of this footage in a live setting would not conflict with existing decor.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/vYoFMH01rZLtPrVgtbIQr8fwFmq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":182,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exhibitionist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Mills","original_name":"Jeff Mills","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":"/mqHqneFO3qlo5kSqmWBXH3vrO7U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d6fc3a368484e1e914d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Mills","original_name":"Jeff Mills","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":"/mqHqneFO3qlo5kSqmWBXH3vrO7U.jpg","credit_id":"5ebfe2b428723c0021446679","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6GAMrTNIw4UnLiEtk18eOAYJfBE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2080}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vYoFMH01rZLtPrVgtbIQr8fwFmq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
