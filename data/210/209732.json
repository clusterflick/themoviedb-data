It mixes B&W footage of Smith's creatures with old campaign footage of Willkie, a liberal Republican who ran against FDR in the 1940's. The climax of the work appears to be the \"auctioning\" of the presidential candidate at a convention.","popularity":0.1663,"poster_path":"/BXsskHDroA3NLlo4GtilcZZrE8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Smith","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No President","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Montez","original_name":"Mario Montez","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/yFzOT9ZvKt8kbuQ9xxfiYiUP1FE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"595be8819251415a4002b208","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piero Heliczer","original_name":"Piero Heliczer","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/mmOySznrfNFQGPGkoaMgKGRDx74.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"595be897c3a368265d059562","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tally Brown","original_name":"Tally Brown","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"595be8cec3a368293b0601af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Sims","original_name":"Jerry Sims","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"595be8dac3a3680d5902d47e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Kerness","original_name":"Donna Kerness","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/pCVIeMUjsOOrhj3r9UgrpVgHeW5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"595be8e492514121f003fb09","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Henri Ford","original_name":"Charles Henri Ford","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/5Rgc6YokBqcI9uclaBwiHZdi7bD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"595be8eec3a3680d5902d49e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Francine","original_name":"Francis Francine","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59627dc092514122510bc5f6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Malanga","original_name":"Gerard Malanga","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/h5wHiT55EJHC9VvlnCVZi2wNW76.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2c50cda294f0394b291251","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Smith","original_name":"Jack Smith","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/wmcKDsXdH6MunekpYt5TnxM1RXE.jpg","credit_id":"5a0a544ec3a368213800c46f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Smith","original_name":"Jack Smith","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/wmcKDsXdH6MunekpYt5TnxM1RXE.jpg","credit_id":"6042d944ebb99d005a4c662b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0164117","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grU67EsJsJCqA9a97xV9AWq2ONS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":826,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/BXsskHDroA3NLlo4GtilcZZrE8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":851,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fQggGEf9uK6kug79Ly25BZ4ubpM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Elgin Cinema","release_date":"1969-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
