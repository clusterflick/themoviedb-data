The theme is Weightlessness. Objects and characters are cut loose from habitual meanings, also from tensions and gravitational limitations. A lyric Eric Satie track accompanies the film. Such a portrait seems necessary from time to time to remind us that equilibrium and harmony are possible, and that we will not dissolve into a jelly if we allow ourselves to relax into them: A horseman rides through the landscape, through the town, but never arrives anywhere in particular. An acrobat swings on a rope above a canal in Venice, and is content just to swing there. Nothing threatens to disturb them. This film is a total contrast to the Kafka-like oddities of Eastern European animation. —Canyon Cinema","popularity":0.1829,"poster_path":"/7dMzDN2MmqLa3dEMJqkGL9eYDuU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gymnopédies","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d6ac3a368484e1e8115","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15119,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Satie","original_name":"Erik Satie","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/5jn7eNKDP9lURFQt2tSj84qnVC9.jpg","credit_id":"5ab2d793925141164b010fab","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2327317","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7dMzDN2MmqLa3dEMJqkGL9eYDuU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
