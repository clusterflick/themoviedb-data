Blaine stood encased in a massive block of ice located in Times Square, New York City. He was lightly dressed and seen to be shivering even before the blocks of ice were sealed around him. A tube supplied him with air and water while his urine was removed with another tube. He was encased in the box of ice for 63 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds before being removed with chain saws. The ice was transparent and resting on an elevated platform to show that he was actually inside the ice the entire time.","popularity":0.7024,"poster_path":"/xIOA95kaMTTP5A3yWXUlmVY7wbL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blaine is the hottest name in magic right now.","title":"David Blaine: Frozen in Time","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"David Blaine: Jääaika","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Blaine","original_name":"David Blaine","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/zHmmIAUtnP6A4d4lXKMlLyKy1TO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d6dc3a368484e1e8a8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenny Kravitz","original_name":"Lenny Kravitz","popularity":1.6148,"profile_path":"/pIoGuEUax5aeH3PKuaYK9wKEeoj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Guest Appearance","credit_id":"5363b0690e0a261dfe002a8a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Goodman","original_name":"Roger Goodman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5363afcc0e0a261dfb002ae6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103711,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Gibgot","original_name":"Adam Gibgot","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5363aff90e0a261dfe002a79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316053,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Goodman","original_name":"Barry Goodman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5363afe40e0a261e09002a12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Stern Winters","original_name":"Nancy Stern Winters","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641f84ba2dc9dc00de0c57e8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0269133","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xIOA95kaMTTP5A3yWXUlmVY7wbL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2343,"name":"magic"},{"id":155395,"name":"endurance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
