He owns his own car dealership, Tillman's Auto Mall. He has a family, three kids and a wife. But his life isn't as perfect as it seems. His eldest son Richard Jr. is in rehab, his daughter, April, wishes she wasn't a part of the family, and his wife Deborah, is an alcoholic. His only salvation is his youngest son Connor, who is naive to all going on around him. His car dealership is failing miserably, and his assistant, Missy, seems to be quite infatuated with him. His already less-than-perfect life changes once Richard Jr. returns home from rehab without any notice.","popularity":0.1964,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tillman","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Joseph","original_name":"Wayne Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Tillman","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a368484e1e7ae9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Hoobler","original_name":"Timothy Hoobler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Richard Tillman, Jr.","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a368484e1e7aed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Daughterman","original_name":"Erik Daughterman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Connor Tillman","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a368484e1e7af1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonn Kovacs","original_name":"Bonn Kovacs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Deborah Tillman","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a368484e1e7af5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth McIntire","original_name":"Elizabeth McIntire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"April Tillman","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a368484e1e7af9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Pappas","original_name":"Lauren Pappas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Missy","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a368484e1e7afd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas F.
