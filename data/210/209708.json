The films offered Crockwell a chance to experiment with various unorthodox animation techniques such as adding and removing non-drying paint on glass frame-by-frame, squeezing paint between two sheets of glass, and finger painting. The individual films created over a nine-year period were then stitched together for presentation, forming a nonsensical relationship that only highlights the abstract qualities of the images. â€”Kansas City Electronic Music and Arts Alliance","popularity":0.1945,"poster_path":"/fC5o94PWfhFApZo11losMHedBhp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glens Falls Sequence","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglass Crockwell","original_name":"Douglass Crockwell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d6bc3a368484e1e8365","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1971406","wikidata_id":"Q68941833","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fC5o94PWfhFApZo11losMHedBhp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"San Francisco Museum of Art","release_date":"1946-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
