Within a colourless city of walls, corridors, and small rooms, a man makes his way from home to work, then to a bar, and then, by a stroke of luck, into an outdoors of space, fresh air, and colour. Along the way, he changes his face to fit his surroundings, interacts with his dog, argues with co-workers, and gossips at a bar. His altering of his visage suggests a two-faced nature, and his stepping into the outdoors provides the ultimate test of his real identity.","popularity":0.3931,"poster_path":"/9RzNNJxAuHGrAf4kw35lZ1Ry5mM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":297,"logo_path":"/58TnhYZqbMYgkHM6lg7dJoYJ4RH.png","name":"Aardman","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ident","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Nice","original_name":"Phil Nice","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/kDmbCqi7ArGminYAklfHTYkoOtE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe4d6dc3a368484e1e8c65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Smith","original_name":"Arthur Smith","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/h9X209Dfj66JYz7HRbFv3HBbM1N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5a8d3fd5c3a36820b9004c14","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1119835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David McCormick","original_name":"David McCormick","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea1ee806f984012d7312b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1119834,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dave Alex Riddett","original_name":"Dave Alex Riddett","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ad1a5e942ee0091cb3328","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421951,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Gordon","original_name":"Stuart Gordon","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ad1b9f28838007b1554de","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2016583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Mullock","original_name":"Sara Mullock","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb3aec7c3a3681e2b01138f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Starzak","original_name":"Richard Starzak","popularity":0.2164,"profile_path":"/o8Dm54LgHmsxkGmTRtmyKc1boHV.jpg","credit_id":"5fd208c41443f400432e2784","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Starzak","original_name":"Richard Starzak","popularity":0.2164,"profile_path":"/o8Dm54LgHmsxkGmTRtmyKc1boHV.jpg","credit_id":"5fd208db1443f400412dd46d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g0cAdikvjexy33Zgv0SuZJbYww.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9RzNNJxAuHGrAf4kw35lZ1Ry5mM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/80rD4h9yttlEohA43uYmC9t6gao.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":158690,"name":"clay"},{"id":197065,"name":"claymation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Projekt 100, part of Nick Park uvádí...","release_date":"1998-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
