Each scene has been staged and the situations has been built up from scratch.\r The images allude to the recent history of Lima, Peru, and it comes from the intersection of political and biographical images. The timeless and suspended landscapes suggest national memory as a silent and unresolved issue.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sceneries II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Moscoso","original_name":"Marco Moscoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba4b00c15f890064ca034d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348855,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Lagares","original_name":"Daniel Lagares","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba4b11a44d090064ab2808","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"José Luy","original_name":"José Luy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba4b274da3d40086d6ce01","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3294946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Watanabe","original_name":"Maya Watanabe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba4ae3c616ac0043160085","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
