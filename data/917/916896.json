Less than an hour after his birth, he knows how to run. When you are one of the weakest species in the Savannah, it’s a question of survival.

We follow him on one of the largest migrations in the animal kingdom.","popularity":0.099,"poster_path":"/pmkeZVif4L0HDFcpGlvCZSJ1RjF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105852,"logo_path":"/8496jx3PA1EABhAO33sRy7zN49P.png","name":"Magnéto Presse","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punda the Zebra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2999641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Ruello","original_name":"Rachel Ruello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61bbbe7313af5f0092fb71d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","original_name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/g3gdLetHg5qTv7NaxrPtCFxtbPD.jpg","credit_id":"61bbbcf73f8ede001df063e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Rochefort","original_name":"Anne Rochefort","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bbbdc73f8ede001df06662","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","original_name":"Olivia Mokiejewski","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/g3gdLetHg5qTv7NaxrPtCFxtbPD.jpg","credit_id":"61bbbde64da3d40086d935a4","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343626,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Wack","original_name":"Patrick Wack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bbbdafd1444300669a0a4c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Frapat","original_name":"Laurent Frapat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bbbce644a424001c12ef02","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Frapat","original_name":"Laurent Frapat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bbba3254a098009b4921bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmkeZVif4L0HDFcpGlvCZSJ1RjF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
