The political world of a century ago comes to life as we hear debates in the Parliament of Upper and Lower Canada amidst political strife and personal feuds. Ultimately, Cartier skilfully allays the fears of party and sectional leaders, convincing them that federal union would protect, rather than weaken, Quebec’s cherished rights of language and religion. The eloquent and enigmatic Cartier was instrumental in shaping the Canada that was soon to emerge.","popularity":0.6642,"poster_path":"/4Xj564nrFhf5ViypEkdIZ63uM3F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Georges-Étienne Cartier - The Lion of Québec","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hébert","original_name":"Paul Hébert","popularity":0.2011,"profile_path":"/95b03IFOpas0LvxtOTFdTGfzfcY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Georges-Étienne Cartier","credit_id":"64169dd40d5d85007b67fdc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":540394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Christie","original_name":"Robert Christie","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":"/wZD290sqeI40CxFNFsfE58RnX1J.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"MacDonald","credit_id":"64169dfa31032500e8a20c3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Vernon","original_name":"John Vernon","popularity":1.1108,"profile_path":"/xlHU7X2FhjnZVxu7fjoguCWlXeC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Galt","credit_id":"64169e1a310325008efce649","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3968854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Marshall","original_name":"Roger Marshall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Brown","credit_id":"64169e78e9c0dc008f711ec7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1493133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Needles","original_name":"William Needles","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Tupper","credit_id":"64169e87e7414600b96adb65","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Drouin","original_name":"Denis Drouin","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/vF1eLyfJW1I2fxduPi1Zz64uFuJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jacques Auger","credit_id":"64169ea0310325010150dcd4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Howe","original_name":"John Howe","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64169d286a222700e975861a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143485,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julian Biggs","original_name":"Julian Biggs","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64169d320d5d85008386dec3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Glover","original_name":"Guy Glover","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64169d3d310325007c0a0154","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
