Shot in Berlin, a city whose borders were formed and defined by the political and historical climate of post-war Germany. This film has no narrative, it is a journey throuth the city using the 'jump-cut' and 'cinematic time' to move from the past to the present and the present to the past. Trains, airplanes and pesdestrians now move freely through what was a 'divided' city.  This film was originally projected onto a shop window in an Edinburgh street in December as part of a Lght Festival celebrating the European Summit in 1992.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/88FedAlRx4rJX8sndNgmRLZnc4a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festung Europa - Shifting peripheries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2679395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphan Guéneau","original_name":"Stéphan Guéneau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bad1717d5f4b001cbb9f20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Crawford","original_name":"Louise Crawford","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bad1571c63290041148753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/88FedAlRx4rJX8sndNgmRLZnc4a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
