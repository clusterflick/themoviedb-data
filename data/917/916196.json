Yitschak Spiegl was the foster daughter of a Czech mother, and was living as a woman when in 1988 he fled Communist Czechoslovakia. Fragments of his personal history emerge as he visits places in Austria with filmmaker Vita Soul Wilmering where he spent time as a refugee. Chance meetings with people on the street unintentionally form a recurring thread that links up themes of exclusion and pigeonholing, which shape the painful undertone of Spiegl’s life story.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/hqcA9kEPBkqp3hiL08R8DuwAEUO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiegl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vita Soul Wilmering","original_name":"Vita Soul Wilmering","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b9a88b9d8939008f76d29a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21221318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hqcA9kEPBkqp3hiL08R8DuwAEUO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
