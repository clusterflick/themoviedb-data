But it is even harder to solve for the two friends from this film, the \"big hat\" Gypsy, and his Hungarian body - both of them Transylvanians. Many times they don't succeed, but even if they do, their success don't last long. But they know something not all of us know: how to enjoy life. In this neorealistic comedy even if the situations are set up by the director, the two main characters are playing themselves, and solving the problems in their own way. In fact the camera follows the adventures of a real friendship in different countries, through different cultures.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vQEoY8MlEMSOKXzebUjsd3HuYVd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bahrtalo!
