Bessie Beary, wife of Charlie Beary, introduces us to the family which also includes son, Junior, daughter, Suzy, and pet, Goose, which, as Bessie explains, does not get along with Charlie. The story which unfolds explains why. It was Suzy's birthday and Charlie went to get a goose for her birthday supper.
