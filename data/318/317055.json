A semi-sequel to Donskoi's Raduga (1944), the story is set in Nazi-occupied Kiev. The drama focusses on the travails of a typical Soviet family and on the efforts by the Germans to force the reopening of a local munitions factory. The film is at its most grimly effective in a long sequence wherein the Nazis conduct a search for Jewish escapees, culminating in a horribly graphic re-creation of the slaughter of the Jews at Babi Yar. While Donskoi was critically lambasted for his cinematic \"sloppyiness\" during this sequence (hand-held camera, rapid cuts etc.), it can now be seen that he was attempting a realistic, documentarylike interpretation of this infamous Nazi atrocity.","popularity":0.3425,"poster_path":"/gVW5XoZkO3XwsJFzGPLD7GRX34d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4581,"logo_path":"/p858ADU9O67a7ageVEjsk18jqak.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1945-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Taras Family","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Unvanquished","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1700250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Vysotsky","original_name":"Mikhail Vysotsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nnhnXOa0slhl5PSaYX98y2vdIm2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"German engineer","credit_id":"5811e551c3a3687a9d0159f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amvrosi Buchma","original_name":"Amvrosi Buchma","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/vS97uMoPFYKiMnc0vBj0EN93Y89.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Taras Yatsenko","credit_id":"5b4660c7925141254200048e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniil Sagal","original_name":"Даниил Сагал","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/amOANF5f8cdIK5dFWufYsTLr7Xb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stepan","credit_id":"5b4661000e0a26612b000528","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1540523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeni Ponomarenko","original_name":"Yevgeni Ponomarenko","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/eF5tz4DYbrNwPSIkNjIRNWXZVJR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Andrey","credit_id":"5b46612b0e0a26611c0004f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Troyanovsky","original_name":"Михаил Трояновский","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/ava6oR3xprgaPYoIlRVW4vI4Iqg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nazar Ivanovich Omelchenko","credit_id":"5b4661590e0a266134000576","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1308327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Osmyalovskaya","original_name":"Ekaterina Osmyalovskaya","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Valya","credit_id":"5b466177c3a36851e90005e1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Troitsky","original_name":"Сергей Троицкий","popularity":0.2878,"profile_path":"/A3MaqD6KKPnup3mWvou375yA5pE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Policeman (uncredited)","credit_id":"5b66d9ef0e0a267eeb0a4466","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2268677,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Boris L.
