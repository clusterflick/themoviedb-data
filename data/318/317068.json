Arabella is a woman of the world who arrives at a remote Foreign Legion outpost for a rendezvous with her current lover, Captain Duveuil. It so happens that one of Arabella's previous amours, Captain Somerville (Paul Meurisse), is also serving at the same post. So much for joining the Foreign Legion to forget. A climactic knife duel \"solves\" the film's various plot complications. Despite its Foreign Legion background, Bethsabee has next to no action, which must have made things difficult when the film was distributed to the U.S.","popularity":0.3431,"poster_path":"/5ZZlVK1wYKizTOFcMHzi3PL4g5G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Industrielle et Commerciale Cinématographique","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Corona","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1947-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bethsabée","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Darrieux","original_name":"Danielle Darrieux","popularity":0.4218,"profile_path":"/v68BElpD1LEnthxzjtDiJgnd2Th.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Arabella Delvert","credit_id":"6184ac243faba0006257cf22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Marchal","original_name":"Georges Marchal","popularity":0.2923,"profile_path":"/n9Ct7fmIFAHRtXaRlrMaECMDF2k.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Le capitaine Georges Dubreuil","credit_id":"6184ac32e93e9500625fa0fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Murat","original_name":"Jean Murat","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/PTYkaeYb0NMXCjn1wpVJyMyali.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Le Colonel de Cervière","credit_id":"6184ac3ee93e9500625fa103","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Meurisse","original_name":"Paul Meurisse","popularity":0.2694,"profile_path":"/i9YSdeQDiMGoN12aZwsPIwh0tjs.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Le capitaine Lucien Sommervill -
