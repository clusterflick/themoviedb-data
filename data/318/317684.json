Through her father's eyes and her seven aunts and uncles' confessions, she tries to understand why they kept their memories silent for so long. From the French Bask country to South America, she follows their steps and explores their individual struggles, whether these were through union or legal political actions, or through clandestine activities within an urban guerrilla organisation called the Tupamaros. A silence that has left so many wounds yet to be healed.","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":"/lf62QUskgGHYheQniFNQp3JnS34.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smac","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets
