Released in the U.S. as The Dynamite Brothers, the film concerns the misadventures of three brothers, musicians all. The story follows the siblings' progress from the conservatory to a desert island to the Venice Carnival. The message is that happiness must be earned, a sugar-coated pill of wisdom that went down easily with the film's youthful fans. Not quite in the Disney league, I Fratelli Dinamite is nonetheless colorful, expertly rendered entertainment.","popularity":0.1595,"poster_path":"/8rzWrMddtOrOkUOrrbYRYJ4HXo2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pagot Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1949-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dynamite Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Silvani","original_name":"Aldo Silvani","popularity":0.1605,"profile_path":"/8nrYSS8C5sYMhSmzSvRZR7tmiGo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narratore (voce)","credit_id":"65d8fa309a358d0186ff31d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nino Pagot","original_name":"Nino Pagot","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/jnmlyIC2iOqu1TLk97zB0fjN9nx.jpg","credit_id":"54b2c25b925141144f00236c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toni Pagot","original_name":"Toni Pagot","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/A0zbJxc8DTOSPlQ7L6OFhEQH8rJ.jpg","credit_id":"54b2c26f925141746c0044b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Osvaldo Cavandoli","original_name":"Osvaldo Cavandoli","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/iFnaKmEyH9Byr57b4zNFvkkTprX.jpg","credit_id":"619073a87ac82900435346f1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4553446,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Piazzi","original_name":"Giuseppe Piazzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8fc1fd55c3d017fdb246e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4553447,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Franco Cagnoli","original_name":"Franco Cagnoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8fc33aaf8970165bc534d","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nino Pagot","original_name":"Nino Pagot","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/jnmlyIC2iOqu1TLk97zB0fjN9nx.jpg","credit_id":"65d8fc4815c63601621d71fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toni Pagot","original_name":"Toni Pagot","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/A0zbJxc8DTOSPlQ7L6OFhEQH8rJ.jpg","credit_id":"65d8fc513520e80187d6436e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0050410","wikidata_id":"Q3147171","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/puNMM9UOppc6zASKMmvUmpgQvve.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/phr0AKc9D2Gcd6ggpXHHu2gwmTL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":974,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mnVwhlhJKoPpl9wiUSRY2ErKfHk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1732}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/8rzWrMddtOrOkUOrrbYRYJ4HXo2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
