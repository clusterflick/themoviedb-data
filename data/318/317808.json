Through the emblematic themes of his work, such as love, desire, death or immortality, this film proposes to revisit the places that have marked him: Pittsburgh, the flagship city of the steel industry, the city of his childhood and his first discoveries; New York, where he has been living for many years with his companion Frédéric, a city that symbolizes encounters and desire; and finally Vermont, for the nature, the seasons and the disused hotel where he works. These places bring out the artist's fantasy, humor and emotion. Duane Michals is a young man of 80 years, with a great freedom of spirit and vitality, his enthusiasm is contagious and this film is a reflection of it.","popularity":0.2455,"poster_path":"/7DaFLmJe3SscLQsVNNuGpXts4wh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duane Michals: The Man Who Invented Himself","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Michals","original_name":"Duane Michals","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58043e0c9251412661001bd9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1386750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Guichard","original_name":"Camille Guichard","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ca58003d4d96005437ce5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4300344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/byIFxi6a5oaZknzkdGxhaFar4zF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7DaFLmJe3SscLQsVNNuGpXts4wh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":259285,"name":"gay artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
