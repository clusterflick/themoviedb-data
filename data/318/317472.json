In love with the beautiful Margharita (Lila Lee), Luigi lands a job in the music store owned by the girl's uncle. Ultimately, however, our hero does the Pagliacci act when Margharita evinces a preference for handsome Pasquale (David Rollins). The film's best scene takes place in a nursery full of talented tots, a sequence that undoubtedly reminded Jessel of his days with Gus Edwards' \"Schoolroom\" act. Exercising his droit du seigneur, Georgie Jessel sings the title tune.","popularity":0.2873,"poster_path":"/gUQeaESmVgoShEk3vLASLu2Ivdb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love, Live & Laugh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Jessel","original_name":"George Jessel","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/hhEwbwuBcT0JK4SiuGAYva5Yec2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Luigi","credit_id":"54b3f2eac3a36805d3001c90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Lee","original_name":"Lila Lee","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/2AiD7dau2Fhu8bE7x7vthdu9Ism.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Margharita","credit_id":"54b3f2f992514115e10001ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Rollins","original_name":"David Rollins","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/icOGeuvetcrhK55QNqIzu6D1b6w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pasquale Gallupi","credit_id":"54b3f305c3a3687a63000c0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kolker","original_name":"Henry Kolker","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/mZ5QUU0Sm8h5x4YdSO6ekiRGswU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Enrico","credit_id":"54b3f312c3a3680940006dcf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Loder","original_name":"John Loder","popularity":0.2374,"profile_path":"/4F6RnLjEuhetDl4qu8QUH3pMrf1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dr. Price","credit_id":"61a7de6127ff9900668bdf07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3301764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Reinhardt","original_name":"John Reinhardt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/2SNGdGjr5OaYCTlTyT7mPFixaTC.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"61a7de753dc313002d2a7251","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Winslow","original_name":"Dick Winslow","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/9Py3kHyImtkWn25CnJrTbbagqZQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"61a7de8c0582240042b6eb0d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Armetta","original_name":"Henry Armetta","popularity":0.2401,"profile_path":"/9Bvd4g9QaFoMtYm3VYpJeAa9R3I.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"61a7de9a3d4d96002e68fcbc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Manon","original_name":"Marcia Manon","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":"/sCmbJrJB4Fbs00PzvIQEfLPTaF6.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"61a7dea9957e6d004549fed6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Mandy","original_name":"Jerry Mandy","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/3DrwSCauQa24p4fVGfhvww8KsUq.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Barber","credit_id":"61a7deb9a24c50002c59932d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William K.
