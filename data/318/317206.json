The man of the title is miserable miser Seraphim (Hector Charland). Misanthropic to the point of insanity, Seraphim takes great pleasure in destroying the lives of everyone with whom he comes in contact. His current target is Alexis (Guy Provost), the ex-lover of Seraphim's long-suffering wife Donalda (Nicole Germain). Taking into consideration its daytime-drama source, it's understandable that Un Homme et Son Peche is plotted and paced like a soap opera. Star Hector Charland had previously spent 10 years portraying Seraphim on radio, so he's got plenty of \"mean\" at his disposal for this big-screen spin-off.","popularity":0.0835,"poster_path":"/oQAOdh5qiBVwxhxsLmu7FAql1m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1949-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Man and His Sin","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1777149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hector Charland","original_name":"Hector Charland","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ik4XEkE42KOBGQovxra2uRFGa5X.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Seraphin Poudrier","credit_id":"5cae5fb1c3a3683c26a91f80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1772998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Germain","original_name":"Nicole Germain","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/eD2K8meiLWKi7lREwEvrNnf0VNL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donalda","credit_id":"5cae5fbd0e0a2626c8c1434a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Provost","original_name":"Guy Provost","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":"/6WmYN5ydQYYZdx7qZ7hD2sFUBHX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alexis Labranche","credit_id":"5cae5fccc3a3683c22a922e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1773007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Poitras","original_name":"Henri Poitras","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3rEBpR2Gc2gA2EktzRNAu0Z01wV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jambe de bois","credit_id":"5cb4b9f992514124ce21884c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1780646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Avon","original_name":"Suzanne Avon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jLpTg4b1zQa4NRPZ3otmqHYNmzq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Artémise","credit_id":"5cb4ba030e0a2626cacb0e7b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1777148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ovila Légaré","original_name":"Ovila Légaré","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/yORUFsDB8qco03H6iGft1X0rGNC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Père Laloge","credit_id":"5cb4ba0e0e0a2626dbcaed2f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Lefebvre","original_name":"Arthur Lefebvre","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Père Zime","credit_id":"5cb4ba2f0e0a2626e9cad07b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Alexander","original_name":"George Alexander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Wabo","credit_id":"5cb4bac492514124ce21896e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1700826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Béliveau","original_name":"Juliette Béliveau","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/Aq1ozkveItjkkIm29zHEhnbAavt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Caroline","credit_id":"5cb4bacfc3a3683c22b2ff21","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Lippé","original_name":"Julien Lippé","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/zvMKCTIkRGYyBPhvZWmcTZur2gn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Malterre","credit_id":"5cb4badc0e0a2626c5cacec3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1875513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Ducharme","original_name":"Camille Ducharme","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Notaire","credit_id":"5cb4baec0e0a2626cacb0fc5","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Guèvremont","original_name":"Paul Guèvremont","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tYCeTSuz3XBJ9SMRSCRWIg0HVMb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Perdichaud","credit_id":"5cb4baf8c3a3681e7ab20696","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1909781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Tremblay","original_name":"Fanny Tremblay","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jzS6iMii5PdrImDMswiHOLdpMT.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Une Femme","credit_id":"5cb4bb0ec3a3680891af8212","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Leguet","original_name":"Armand Leguet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"","credit_id":"666869c9663197f8b8be9e1f","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4769314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
