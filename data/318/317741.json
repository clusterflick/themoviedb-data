Goodnight staged an old-style buffalo hunt, using Indians, led by a 70-hear-old Kiowa named Horse, from the reservation at Fort Sill, Okla. The Wiswall brothers from Denver spent nearly a month shooting the hunt and other footage at the ranch. The resulting film, Old Texas was shown at a cattlemen's association meeting in Denver and was subsequently lost.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Texas","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Goodnight","original_name":"Charles Goodnight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b54c5a925141746c0085db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
