After discovering the seal, Clint goes mad. He then tells his tenant he can't keep Alvin (the seal) because no animals are allowed. A man looking for a circus act visits the tenant, and is not highly impressed by the seal, until Clint chases Alvin. The man then wants to sign the seal and Clint as a \"clown with seal\" act.
