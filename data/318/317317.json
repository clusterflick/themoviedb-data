Utilizing the archives of several European film reserves, director Denise Tua offers a fascinating mosaic of the people and events that shaped the years 1900 to 1950. Complementing the vintage film clips are three dramatized sketches, delineating the romantic customs of three different points in time. These sketches are inadequately performed, and can easily be ignored. Ce Siecle a 50 Ans both preserved and provided celluloid material for scores of future documentaries.","popularity":0.5926,"poster_path":"/yvkdx73ALg7JbdX5brKJQqZWTDr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7248,"logo_path":null,"name":"UGC Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malbran","origin_country":""},{"id":27260,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.E.P.I.C.","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1950-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Century Is Fifty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Fresnay","original_name":"Pierre Fresnay","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/kHa9UH2jlarWBkpyFSe5n1RsM8u.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"58d8c6af9251411fd506a06a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Bernhardt","original_name":"Sarah Bernhardt","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":"/z86wlobeTeNV6qmIPHCPPeXO6ud.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"58d8c6b8c3a3681289068d9c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58d8c6c1c3a3681234065db4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Daëms","original_name":"Marie Daëms","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/7IHY5lDNrHs27VNm3XmtmpJxewB.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58d8c6c99251411f8906a555","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwight D.
