But in reality, he's broke, living out of his van, $93,000 in debt and still looking for the ever-elusive purpose of his life. Pop, an elderly friend from the past, offers Victor his only choice - to come back home. Through the story's inspiring ending of reconciled relationships and realized dreams, we are reminded that no life is \"common\" - and that everyone has a God-given purpose.","popularity":0.1537,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redemption Of The Commons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Marr Williams","original_name":"Jeremy Marr Williams","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Victor Clay","credit_id":"56b69db392514131e30005b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Lozoff","original_name":"Melissa Lozoff","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jeana Clay","credit_id":"56b69e0ec3a36806f100a2dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abbey Kochman","original_name":"Abbey Kochman","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shay Clay","credit_id":"56b69e21925141677c000be8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Loraine Anderson","original_name":"Susan Loraine Anderson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hope Stevens","credit_id":"56b69e31c3a3684816004c9c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573802,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"K.T.
