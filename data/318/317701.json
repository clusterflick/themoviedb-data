Magoo is disappointed to learn his nephew, Waldo, had a fight with his girlfriend, Juliette. Magoo plans to have Waldo and Juliette reunited but instead of going to Juliette's apartment, he goes instead to a boxing ring where a boxing female kangaroo is sparring. Magoo mistakes the kangaroo for Juliette and invites her home to meet Waldo. Unfortunately, the kangaroo is trained to throw punches every time she hears a bell and Waldo is usually at the receiving end of the blows.","popularity":0.0603,"poster_path":"/uJdgWmzxSCujYyRqNnYB7HRkJpy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kangaroo Courting","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pete Burness","original_name":"Pete Burness","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b50af492514152d40015df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151179","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Qy6Ua2yaBP8fslvldBNYSBQRWr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uJdgWmzxSCujYyRqNnYB7HRkJpy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1954-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
