J.P. Hasson's surreal shows mix synthesized tunes, hilarious lyrics and costumes more outrageous than anything Elton John wore in the 1970s. With songs such as \"Beef Flavored Island\" and \"Droid County\" and a singer switching from a furry yeti costume to a silver spaceman suit, you can bet there's never a dull moment in this live show.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pleaseeasaur: Action Spectacular","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
