Focusing on the insular Celtic language Breton, the work is a reflection of the deprivation of heritage that happens when an orally transmitted culture is heavily discouraged, almost to the point of extinction, by the government. In part a fictional collective memory, in part an attempt to reconnect with my family history, the film is Brittany as I have come to know it as an adult.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/u9y7HFbM2t7lsob4aukqMwcEWfo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penn-ar-Bed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3374176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Guziou","original_name":"Eric Guziou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61d9df6d158c85001c8143d5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3374180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Ramsay-Tanniou","original_name":"Emma Ramsay-Tanniou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d9df87f263ba001d7fab73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3374180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Ramsay-Tanniou","original_name":"Emma Ramsay-Tanniou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d9df8c67b613008f53dfb0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3374180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Ramsay-Tanniou","original_name":"Emma Ramsay-Tanniou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d9df922b113d00661b2a15","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u9y7HFbM2t7lsob4aukqMwcEWfo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
