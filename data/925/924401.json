The plot of Rookie of the Year, except for rap. Main character E-Merge gets hit by a car and wakes up with an ability to rap (or possibly just the impulse to rap.) It's unclear, in the course of the film, whether or not he's supposed to be particularly talented at rapping, since all he does with his talent is commit petty crimes around his hometown of Jackson, Michigan. Jackson residents, past and present, will delight in the actual footage of Hot Air Jubilee, an annual festival built around the landing of hot air balloons.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":167498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Common Target Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bitch I'm From Jackson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3373357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric \"E-Merge\" Whiting","original_name":"Eric \"E-Merge\" Whiting","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"E-Merge","credit_id":"61d911c35c5cc800423706b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3373360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron \"Big Lou\" Lewis","original_name":"Aaron \"Big Lou\" Lewis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Domino","credit_id":"61d913030e5aba0094ce2697","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3373357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric \"E-Merge\" Whiting","original_name":"Eric \"E-Merge\" Whiting","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d911ffc68b6900a3382fb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.147,"height":1004,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xjRYGJtl9RtZLowOqOOZUlsIG9W.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2156}],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
