But she didn't anticipate that Alex would die soon after, and she would be left on her own. After promising him on his deathbed to keep their beloved farm going, she's left wrangling 90-some deer, over 100 laying hens, two dogs and an organic 'pick-your-own' vegetable business. For three pivotal years, she struggles against all odds to keep the farm going. Armed with a quick wit, a feisty spirit, recycled everything, and the help of her community, Gail learns there's more than one way to honor a promise. DOEVILLE is a quirky, uplifting story of love and survival set on a small farm in the heart of America.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doeville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3324896,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathryn Pasternak","original_name":"Kathryn Pasternak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qBOEGMTxnxRjP01DdfhuAoDAmro.jpg","credit_id":"61da6323b54002006604126a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4678870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
