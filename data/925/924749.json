A series of 4 short films shot over 2021 across the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox and Winter Solstice, (as well as fine art prints) . The project explores a reconnection with the land, marking these pivotal moments of the year and drawing on folklore that has anchored us to these natural processes throughout history. And also the act of rewilding, ecological processes and the intersection of art and activism. During the months of lockdown many of us have experienced the myriad health benefits of engaging with nature, and this in turn has highlighted the natural catastrophes we are now facing.
