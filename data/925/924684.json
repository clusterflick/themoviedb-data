His work does not pay enough to find an apartment of his own. That’s why his first two wives left him. But Morteza is only human. His yearning gets in the way so much that, in conflict with his faith, he sees no other alternative than self-gratification. So: Mory wants a wife. A comic look at a side of Iranian society not often seen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xOLVG0J3HnqCi7cJOzblBHG7vhf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mory Wants a Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3374191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baktash Abtin","original_name":"Baktash Abtin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uHUlLTRq9LanQeFPIqrbujLFiTc.jpg","credit_id":"61d9e60c63a695008d9d2c52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16973962","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1022,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xOLVG0J3HnqCi7cJOzblBHG7vhf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2013-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
