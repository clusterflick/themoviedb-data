To make ends meet, he sublets a room in his apartment in a suburb of Santiago de Chile. However, he seems to have lost control when his housemate departs, leaving him with rent arrears, a collection of plants, a dog, a woolly jumper, and... a house ghost. Pablo is 30, and when it comes to romance he is also chasing apparitions. He is secretly still in love with his ex-boyfriend, a popular YouTuber.","popularity":0.4551,"poster_path":"/dy8Di8HqQkXfjXh34MoDzi0k3YF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113464,"logo_path":"/9cMITYvbLgmef743AtSXBMTx3KO.png","name":"Niña Niño
