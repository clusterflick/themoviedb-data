All this embedded in the political, cultural and social events of the time - from the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to the controversial fashion of the 80s to the worst case scenario in Fukushima in 2011.

That's when he tried his hand at being a solo artist for the first time alongside his \"accomplices\", went on tour through Nicaragua and caught a veritable jaundice there. After a few weeks of convalescence leave, which he spends on his mother's sofa in the south of Cologne, he's already on tour again: This time he and BAP are making more than 100,000 Chinese happy with rock \"Made in Cologne\".
