The film takes Dina Kelberman’s practice of accumulation and recontextualization into a large-scale time-based work for the first time. Reorganizing short clips into a long Rube-Goldberg-like narrative, and featuring a hypnotic minimalist soundtrack by Rod Hamilton and Tiffany Seal, the film portrays a mesmerizing and surreal process in which materials are transformed in myriad ways.","popularity":0.785,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goal Is To Live","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383174,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dina Kelberman","original_name":"Dina Kelberman","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/8TiY88SxTjYkdYIH3kR5JUL3mta.jpg","credit_id":"61d7cd3cc09e99006876bc0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rod Hamilton","original_name":"Rod Hamilton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d7d35fcf1afd00699e8015","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372353,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tiffany Seal","original_name":"Tiffany Seal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d7d373c09e99006876c8f8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"},{"id":163919,"name":"manufacturing"},{"id":211057,"name":"trippy"},{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":224230,"name":"collage film"},{"id":290278,"name":"hypnotic"},{"id":290279,"name":"repurposed footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Goal Is To Live (clip)","key":"396826969","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-10T23:51:46.000Z","id":"61d7d49f0b7316001c550759"}]}}}
