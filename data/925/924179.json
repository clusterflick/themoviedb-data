El nombre de las cosas speaks aloud the unspoken and unspeakable, to give a name to traumas in order to heal them. Deeply poetic and disarmingly honest, director Diego Escobar uses his own story to address a widespread problem of inherited male aggression and all the ways families – and society – cope with and adapt to its toxicity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/aGoerc9ShxOinISTC4ToBu2LLPQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Name of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Escobar","original_name":"Diego Escobar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d85e293344c6006913f6e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17135532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aGoerc9ShxOinISTC4ToBu2LLPQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
