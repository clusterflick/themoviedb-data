Every weekend he picks up 15-year-old Silvia at a party and brings her to the small terraced house in which he no longer lives. That evening, weeping Lara suddenly stands in the front door and tells her father that her rabbit Poldi, which Holger never wanted to buy, fell victim to a marten. Silvia insists on a proper funeral which Holger should attend and which will take place during the night for reasons of time. And so the four become a family again that night - for a brief moment.","popularity":0.1534,"poster_path":"/lhuBhzjosszR7faeMrumgl4dRx5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What We Were","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Aljinovic","original_name":"Boris Aljinovic","popularity":0.2177,"profile_path":"/5lhhDE3lrp0ZzEYjY6lBbqAmB9Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Holger","credit_id":"61d878747d2bc1001c725638","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1194753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annekathrin Bach","original_name":"Annekathrin Bach","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/A11Ui67QaoFhy5spsg61bcy3Q33.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sigrid","credit_id":"61d878815c56340069e73f48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2139116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Floßmann","original_name":"Emma Floßmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Silvia","credit_id":"61d8788d3344c6008fa584c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katerina Veljanoski","original_name":"Katerina Veljanoski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lara","credit_id":"61d87899a1074b0042a8d943","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Elias Weiske","original_name":"Jonathan Elias Weiske","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/t54Jx04S7ziyXmYiS1NqcDIWfKw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fred","credit_id":"61d878a4511d09001caa2d8a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Martin","original_name":"Hannah Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d878bac669ad0041360a1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Martin","original_name":"Hannah Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d878cca589020042c17307","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melanie Waelde","original_name":"Melanie Waelde","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d878dee039f100683a0f33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896404,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lukas Eylandt","original_name":"Lukas Eylandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d879133344c6008fa586e8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024430,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jessica Schneller","original_name":"Jessica Schneller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d87924a35c8e006655c378","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8903846","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/lhuBhzjosszR7faeMrumgl4dRx5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
