As he betrays none of their secrets, he enjoys great prestige in the bistros where he works. The three of them lead a casual life, raising money by illicit means. It's only when Poulou and Amar leave that Jibé understands his isolation and marginalization. The images as well as the sounds help to reinforce the feeling that Paris is a city where he is both at home and a terrible stranger.","popularity":0.3807,"poster_path":"/p7uWtyfdNVCBIm6kSz32sBcu6mq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du
