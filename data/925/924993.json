The time limit on their paradise of university is drawing to a close, and they are all feeling impatient in their own ways. Keiko is unable to find a job. Ueda is unsure of Keiko's feelings. Koike is torn between her dream of becoming a novelist and the reality of finding a job. The summer is passing. As if to hold on to their time in paradise, they enjoy a late night of fireworks. In his dreams, Koike sees a strange family picture. The image of the three of them sitting around a make-shift table on a riverbank overgrown with summer grass softly and unobtrusively conveys to the viewer their anxiety about their ambiguous future. The film's sincere image of adolescence is heartbreaking.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/glTJVxwfYrpJSY72mmtGTEWsLHF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Koike","original_name":"Takashi Koike","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6211598696670e006ba5f483","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2264501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Nomura","original_name":"Keiko Nomura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6211598fa242320044c3d5cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ueda Satoshi","original_name":"Ueda Satoshi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621159963f4833001c931d82","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Koike","original_name":"Takashi Koike","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62115976f6fd1800426a0503","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Koike","original_name":"Takashi Koike","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6211597003f0b600687b03e0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ueda Satoshi","original_name":"Ueda Satoshi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6211599f3e2ec8001b6c1ac0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Koike","original_name":"Takashi Koike","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62115961e0ca7f001b7097bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Koike","original_name":"Takashi Koike","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6211597d41465c001b8542ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glTJVxwfYrpJSY72mmtGTEWsLHF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
