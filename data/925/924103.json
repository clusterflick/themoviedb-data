Perhaps it’s a robot. Why else would a pigeon sit so still on that nest she built atop the power lines, diagonally under their window? For seven days and nights, Polgovsky filmed the bird from his second floor apartment. Together with daughter Mile, he watches life go by: the bin men, the neighbours and their dogs, the gas delivery man, the squirrels dashing through the treetops in search of food. All from the same perspective – basically identical to that of the brooding pigeon, who gets most attention. \"Papa, why are you filming her, really?\"","popularity":0.1843,"poster_path":"/tPaWFob32A0uUOfrvkG9DbO8XVN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malintzin 17","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3372588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mara Polgovsky","original_name":"Mara Polgovsky","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ooAmyxLv3iVPYSzMM5EuV3g06Jh.jpg","credit_id":"61d8273fe039f1009174eaca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugenio Polgovsky","original_name":"Eugenio Polgovsky","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/kOMW2CAW032eFkBgJBorlz24Kwh.jpg","credit_id":"61d8274ba055ef0069c25dd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3372588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mara Polgovsky","original_name":"Mara Polgovsky","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ooAmyxLv3iVPYSzMM5EuV3g06Jh.jpg","credit_id":"61f70e02d7cd0600a519e726","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140285,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julio Chavezmontes","original_name":"Julio Chavezmontes","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":"/ylGZYbMFjJlEDHiEHkTUQoafoss.jpg","credit_id":"61f70e0dd7cd06006f6cf6b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3372588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mara Polgovsky","original_name":"Mara Polgovsky","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ooAmyxLv3iVPYSzMM5EuV3g06Jh.jpg","credit_id":"61f70e1c07216600e00e927f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugenio Polgovsky","original_name":"Eugenio Polgovsky","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/kOMW2CAW032eFkBgJBorlz24Kwh.jpg","credit_id":"61f70e24559d220043c61a40","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro González-Rubio","original_name":"Pedro González-Rubio","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f70e31c5ada50044e8d658","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3372588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mara Polgovsky","original_name":"Mara Polgovsky","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ooAmyxLv3iVPYSzMM5EuV3g06Jh.jpg","credit_id":"61f70e39109230001b3a3b9e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742507,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Javier Umpierrez","original_name":"Javier Umpierrez","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f70e45b7abb5001b232b07","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18327700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omAdOYh6wlyJbSzTzjDfaHsEAb7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":774,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tPaWFob32A0uUOfrvkG9DbO8XVN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI London Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
