Supported by the awesome power of the Juilliard Orchestra, along with featured rock drums and guitars, Daltrey gives a soaring performance on a huge scale.  And the songs more than stand up — \"You Better You Bet,\" \"I Can See For Miles,\" \"Baba O'Reilly,\" \"Behind Blue Eyes,\" \"Pinball Wizard,\" \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" and many more of these timeless creations take on the full dramatic qualities that have always been part and parcel of Townshend's musical and poetic genius.","popularity":0.4557,"poster_path":"/uQQZTQaUMHBpaY6vxVODnFuJzeG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Platinum Pictures
