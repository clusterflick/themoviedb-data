The Ukrainian village of Stuzhytsya is situated in the Carpathian Mountains in the border triangle between Poland and Slovakia. The three elderly female protagonists – a farmer, a post office clerk and a biologist – are firmly rooted in a place where hardly any young people are left in 2019, the year of Zelensky’s election victory. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":"/jY2Ond2Hd9VqE6fe9c5XiB2x8TO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86782,"logo_path":"/zuXKoPd9apgEOvy6rHthcEjJkR7.png","name":"Filmuniversität Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maksym Melnyk","original_name":"Maksym Melnyk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63599787ea7b0e007a40aa7f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892979,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Florian Baumgarten","original_name":"Florian Baumgarten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6359975715959f007a5879a4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Wohlfeil","original_name":"Andrea Wohlfeil","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635997474a4bf6007c59a1dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maksym Melnyk","original_name":"Maksym Melnyk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635997362b9320007d864dbb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2615016,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Meret Madörin","original_name":"Meret Madörin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6359976fc1606a0082499ec7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232863,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jannik Eckenstaler","original_name":"Jannik Eckenstaler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6359977bbf09d1007b5bf006","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maksym Melnyk","original_name":"Maksym Melnyk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635997254a4bf60090aa536a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roman Pogorzelski","original_name":"Roman Pogorzelski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6359979566540800819722cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22489452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jY2Ond2Hd9VqE6fe9c5XiB2x8TO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig","release_date":"2022-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
