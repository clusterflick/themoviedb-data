Luca Bianco is a Christian fundamentalist, obsessed by Islam and by an extremely racist view of Christianity. He spends his time in the study of the Bible. The only person he's in contact with is a woman who comes daily to interview him. He talks to her about his past, about his religious and political belief, about his work and his marriage. She records every conversation on tape, day by day. From this very minimal situation, we jump to a different moment of Luca Bianco's life. It's summer, Luca loses his job, his marriage in in crisis. In the worst moment a engineer named Massimiliano Gorgia - a Christian fundamentalist himself - hires him as a car driver. From this moment, through a very complex plot, we are inside an international intrigue based on the clash of the civilizations on a side, on the difference between individual and politic ethics on the other.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":"/vBtWq2rPcbyvgE712mfCWLjbG7c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251207,"logo_path":null,"name":"D-Movies","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":251208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Textus","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":248648,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monotroupe","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":250840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stultifera Navis","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":185010,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.U.M. - Consorzio Umano Multimediale","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limen [Omission]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2088439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrizio Croci","original_name":"Fabrizio Croci","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/iIr5T8phtH8UbVJeDgPzpteL284.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lui","credit_id":"635a44802d8ef3007c9da1b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Zavaglia","original_name":"Francesca Zavaglia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lei","credit_id":"635a448eca7ec6008f7e5f64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Lattanzio","original_name":"Roberto Lattanzio","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Massimiliano Gorgia","credit_id":"635a44a75258ae007fafad66","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danil Aceto","original_name":"Danil Aceto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lorenzo Gorgia","credit_id":"635a44c13c887d007aede864","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Hanzelewicz","original_name":"Piotr Hanzelewicz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Piotr","credit_id":"635a44cb2495ab007f3fefb7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvira Di Bona","original_name":"Elvira Di Bona","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Veronica Gorgia","credit_id":"635a44e3b1f68d007d8f7881","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiliano Dante","original_name":"Emiliano Dante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a3f7ab1f68d007af2c078","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emiliano Dante","original_name":"Emiliano Dante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d4f925d2980fb0237d32","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337525","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBtWq2rPcbyvgE712mfCWLjbG7c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
