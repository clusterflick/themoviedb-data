Showing up with no invitation, the self-styled ladies’ man will not rest until he has won her affections. She's running out of ways to convey her feelings. He won't take a hint. What can Ada do to get rid of him? What sordid ideas could Otto get once his pride has been wounded? A film palindrome of comic proportions, Wine and Roses (and Wine) explores the dilemmas modern women face when confronting the entitled presumptions of men who won’t take “no” for an answer.","popularity":0.14,"poster_path":"/3sVnXEV1arsTEsl5D9zVZQA5KCS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185039,"logo_path":"/14t31BjNJ3zhLs6PlTtQyweXa7a.png","name":"Glasgow Film Crew","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A polite girl struggles to send away from her home an uninvited guest with romantic intentions.","title":"Wine and Roses (and Wine)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3760206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tegan Farrelly","original_name":"Tegan Farrelly","popularity":0.0489,"profile_path":"/xBxIGQLCBKcYyUYJfav0nMIMZ7D.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ada","credit_id":"635ab5b69af1710090d4111e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098589,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Craig Andrew Robertson","original_name":"Craig Andrew Robertson","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/lXIugwuryWbftwbUAOpzjqnQulb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Otto","credit_id":"635ab5aa894ed600914364ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2745294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abbie McIntosh","original_name":"Abbie McIntosh","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/z7eHLwUO71j6CuXTqGoYj1xrxx3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Girl with Glasses","credit_id":"642767b09cc67b05796b05f7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3760207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Bahena","original_name":"Alex Bahena","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ab5e86d97e6007d40c50d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2585776,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jasmine Lindemann","original_name":"Jasmine Lindemann","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/6sLMQde5534iqc5zdr70jTeRTFQ.jpg","credit_id":"635ab5f42d8ef3008139bc9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098596,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Calum Menzies","original_name":"Calum Menzies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dWHNFkGxR25Q7NRU78jMWsXK6iW.jpg","credit_id":"635ab5feca7ec6008574c053","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"C.J.
