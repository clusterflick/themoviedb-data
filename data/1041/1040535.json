The film was based on a musical show of the same title that opened at the Lewisham Hippodrome on 19 March 1928, in which Jack Buchanan also starred. The music was written by Joseph Meyer and Phil Charig, with lyrics by Douglas Furber. The film omitted much of music of the original show, but popularised one song in particular, Fancy our Meeting. The song remained a Jack Buchanan favourite and a version of it was also recorded by Al Bowlly shortly after the film's release.","popularity":0.5977,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's a Good Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Buchanan","original_name":"Jack Buchanan","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/5cDC7j4ZQBkf3gmpL39jjLzQJe8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Barrow","credit_id":"6359939bc439c0008de60604","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Randolph","original_name":"Elsie Randolph","popularity":0.1132,"profile_path":"/iBjxWwvmzrVuRHrxGS8sn9MmtH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joy Dean","credit_id":"635993aa308131007c2df2e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Hyson","original_name":"Dorothy Hyson","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/yoVGn3DCegfd1WDl6QyLC4t2BTP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Moya Malone","credit_id":"635993ba2cefc2007a5a3214","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garry Marsh","original_name":"Garry Marsh","popularity":0.2896,"profile_path":"/zJz144HUdUc4cVuQma5ql9SZFXX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Francis Moray","credit_id":"635993ca31644b007f6fd1f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":613276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Pearce","original_name":"Vera Pearce","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Suny Berata","credit_id":"635993d8a1353300797d068c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":354261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Kendall","original_name":"William Kendall","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Timothy","credit_id":"635993e6308131008498fa32","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Cutler","original_name":"Kate Cutler","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/fsSLoEMGt3OLSMeo0NmTtGNlbBZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Helen Malone","credit_id":"635993f330813100a3369208","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Stanmore","original_name":"Frank Stanmore","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/szxdpqPHAQWmqlg4NUyUoNbzJYP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Malone","credit_id":"63599409665408007e0c09c3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Holles","original_name":"Anthony Holles","popularity":0.2232,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Canzone","credit_id":"635994192cefc20098644afc","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Buchanan","original_name":"Jack Buchanan","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/5cDC7j4ZQBkf3gmpL39jjLzQJe8.jpg","credit_id":"6359942a1684f70079014264","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389215,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douglas Furber","original_name":"Douglas Furber","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635994421108a8007e753a88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Buchanan","original_name":"Jack Buchanan","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/5cDC7j4ZQBkf3gmpL39jjLzQJe8.jpg","credit_id":"6359943631644b0098c69afa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607551,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Donovan Pedelty","original_name":"Donovan Pedelty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6359944d1684f7007901426c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0024652","wikidata_id":"Q23999959","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
