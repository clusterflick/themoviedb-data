In this cinematographic essay, Rolf Orthel looks for the meaning of creating, with reality or the memory of it as a starting point and a train journey as a meandering ribbon through the film. We see the first musical steps of primary school children and youngsters at Jeugdtheaterschool Zuid-Oost. We see what talent does to you when a conservatory student practices for his graduation, when someone paints a remarkable self-portrait or when Konvooi creates a thrilling play. This is high-level creation which makes you wonder how on earth it is possible that you can suddenly be enchanted and moved. The conclusion of Orthelâ€™s search? Creating things is the best.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/xDZeXCQ7BLf00FO9LPJW9Aqjpz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doc.Eye Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creating things is the best","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179976,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rolf Orthel","original_name":"Rolf Orthel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635989ff308131007c2df101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van Reemst","original_name":"Frank van Reemst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598a61a1353300797d0500","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2062747,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joost Verheij","original_name":"Joost Verheij","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598a6f308131007c2df124","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712267,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rolf Orthel","original_name":"Rolf Orthel","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598a7be894a600796f07e2","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557648,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Brugman","original_name":"Peter Brugman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598a871684f700810bceb5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179976,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rolf Orthel","original_name":"Rolf Orthel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598a9131644b007f6fd05a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790391,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Menno Euwe","original_name":"Menno Euwe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598a9b30813100a33690a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759247,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hens van Rooy","original_name":"Hens van Rooy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598aa72b93200082762a33","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223870,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Langhout","original_name":"Erik Langhout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598ab1ea7b0e007a40a82f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223870,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Langhout","original_name":"Erik Langhout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598abd31644b007a1c457a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Elings","original_name":"Albert Elings","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63598aca1684f7007c55c233","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKridudkispzAh5PZnNGKaac2Je.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aZ3JlPKoOKVDvjlsKa9E5cio3ia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yw7PMUTUWN5wwqqfw1uR3iT7gBb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s6YTOVVpXxJsKRL1hHaSk8xWtsq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2jaALMhhxTZqLyPfSGb0uGIx34A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xDZeXCQ7BLf00FO9LPJW9Aqjpz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Maken is het Mooist [TRAILER]","key":"1xznm4kDk3k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-30T08:37:12.000Z","id":"63598a4c15959f007f1d3226"}]}}}
