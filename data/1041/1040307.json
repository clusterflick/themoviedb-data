In 2014, when the annexation of Crimea by Russia took place, the signatory countries accepted the occupation. On December 5, 2019, our creative team carried out an intervention at the Museum of Modern Art in Odesa, in the form of an illegal installation of the \"I Want More\" exhibit in the museum's exposition. The purpose of the film and the intervention is to show the people of Ukraine and the international community that attempts to appease Russia and make concessions to it will only lead to new aggression and new occupation of territories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pUmEd2ptMjtBrbJK2KcAbPU6PYk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crime Without Punishment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Злочин без покарання","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Intervention 'Crime Without Punishment'","type":"long credits english title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrii Liubov","original_name":"Andrii Liubov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635917ea42f19f007f736a1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrii Liubov","original_name":"Andrii Liubov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635917f5ea7b0e007dc085ba","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758578,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Darya Melkina","original_name":"Darya Melkina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635918072b93200082760751","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3758579,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pavlo Maistrenko","original_name":"Pavlo Maistrenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63591817308131008498d500","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23032206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pUmEd2ptMjtBrbJK2KcAbPU6PYk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bardak Film Fest","release_date":"2022-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
