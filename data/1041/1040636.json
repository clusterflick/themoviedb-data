She falls to the floor and begins a cycle of walking and crawling that becomes an open metaphor for evolution and aging. Through the course of the performance, the camera follows Forti's circling motion at increasingly close range, creating an interactive dance between camera and performer. While \"rustic\" in respect to the quality of the video image and sound, Solo No. 1 serves as an engaging document of Forti's dedicated study of natural movement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solo No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Forti","original_name":"Simone Forti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"635a09d9e74146007a9d5c15","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Forti","original_name":"Simone Forti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a09cc2495ab007f3fd510","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
