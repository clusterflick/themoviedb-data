Along with his wife Mary, Bill amassed thousands of toys, most from 1890 to 1970. The Furnish Collection includes trains and planes, cars and zeppelins, stuffed animals, games and banks, toy soldiers, robots (He plays with one worth $25,000), Erector sets, a fleet of boats and more.\r Bill takes us on a tour, making the toys come alive by telling stories and relating the toys to the times in which they were made - all with great style, wit and Ã©lan. Bill believed toys were important because they perpetuated the joys of childhood.  \"Bill was fantastic,\" remembers Dale Kelly, publisher of Antique Toy World, \"He lit up a room. He was a great storyteller and he loved to share his vast knowledge of the toys.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/saEfyOm634T2DPqN1Og6qSXLn7K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toys of the Past The William Furnish Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/saEfyOm634T2DPqN1Og6qSXLn7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
