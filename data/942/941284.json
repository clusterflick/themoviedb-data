Mamoru, the protagonist, is constantly being pushed around by her. And his eccentric friends. Suzuki is hated by everyone because he spits on everything. Mamoru's best friend, Ichiro, is a homosexual and likes Mamoru. Naomi, Ichiro's girlfriend, can only do everything according to the manual. All the time they are muttering, \"Isn't there anything interesting? They are completely unfazed by the suicide of their colleague Hamada, who committed suicide by drowning himself in a toilet basin, and death is just a figment of their imagination. However, as if they too are being watched, one by one they become the heroes of the suicide game. Who will survive to the end? This is an absurd but realistic portrait of adolescence, in which the characters, deformed with their own personalities, coolly reflect the youthfulness of a time when apathy, emotionlessness and pessimism prevail.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/u6eV40ogqAYgNKmZazeEDJDvGf7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Naive Goldfish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yamashita Hiroshi","original_name":"Yamashita Hiroshi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6213d4216e3deb004218f1e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naono Makoto","original_name":"Naono Makoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6213d42a3f4833006b817d0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kido Yuji","original_name":"Kido Yuji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6213d43320e6a5001bcf5ad3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsuchiumi Miyuki","original_name":"Tsuchiumi Miyuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6213d43f0bb0760043fd8a84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mio Keira","original_name":"Mio Keira","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6213d4491a3248006ab9bee2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matsuura Kojiro","original_name":"Matsuura Kojiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6213d45141465c006c66465e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takei Toru","original_name":"Takei Toru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213d4d1d3d387001c88a383","department":"Art","job":"Runner Art Department"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437536,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sugimura Takanori","original_name":"Sugimura Takanori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213d4dc813831001c620b70","department":"Art","job":"Runner Art Department"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437537,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nakayama Naoto","original_name":"Nakayama Naoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213d4ef0bb0760043fd8c6b","department":"Art","job":"Runner Art Department"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","original_name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62127538f6fd1800426d0fd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","original_name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212753fe0ca7f001b740699","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","original_name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621275460bb0760043f95348","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","original_name":"Hiroshi Okamoto","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212754b03f0b6004234fe7d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u6eV40ogqAYgNKmZazeEDJDvGf7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
