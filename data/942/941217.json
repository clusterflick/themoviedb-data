The man who closes it refuses conventional communication with a strong desire for self-expression, and throws and scatters his lost \"self\" all over the place, regardless of who he is or where he is. The camera becomes a part of the artist, crawls on the ground with him, and starts to rotate with him. Self-deprecating, voyeuristic, violent... A vivid depiction of the sick soul of modern youth.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/uHPnWqeZu8CtvC6svvCThJ9MyQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Closed Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kikuchi Mami","original_name":"Kikuchi Mami","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62125532e92d83006d1c8616","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takuji Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木卓爾","popularity":0.3869,"profile_path":"/fUOVWR3upxekGxSK533cLLsKGiZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6212553a89b561004229cb91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","original_name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6212554196670e006ba89c0c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","original_name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212550244a424001f5dbbcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","original_name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212550da84ff70020d89ce6","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","original_name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125508a84ff700475b90a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","original_name":"Yasunobu Nakagawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621255141d538600699054d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uHPnWqeZu8CtvC6svvCThJ9MyQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
