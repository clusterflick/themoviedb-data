Through their stories, a picture emerges of those on the periphery of society who succumbed to alcohol because of war or difficult living conditions. They are aware of their own State; reason is still there, but the Will is lacking. The film is a cry for help on behalf of humans, it is a dispassionate and honest description of the position of degenerate alcoholics in Finnish society in the early 1970s.","popularity":0.2736,"poster_path":"/glV5iANc50UKVgT7c0GkLNIOP1P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1971-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shadow of a City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannu Peltomaa","original_name":"Hannu Peltomaa","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212979189b561006be2553d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannu Peltomaa","original_name":"Hannu Peltomaa","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227a8412f1be00045ab4408","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannu Peltomaa","original_name":"Hannu Peltomaa","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227a7c855c1f4007011d17e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210351,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erkki Peltomaa","original_name":"Erkki Peltomaa","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227a7da1130bd0045db9a21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannu Peltomaa","original_name":"Hannu Peltomaa","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227a85355c1f4007011d338","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761886,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hannu Koski","original_name":"Hannu Koski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64351904e6357100b447b093","department":"Sound","job":"Production Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210351,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erkki Peltomaa","original_name":"Erkki Peltomaa","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643518b2ec8a430219264e10","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Jyr채l채","original_name":"Paul Jyr채l채","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643518d8e6357100778b757b","department":"Sound","job":"Production Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210338,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matti Kuortti","original_name":"Matti Kuortti","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6435191daf432400bd1e02c1","department":"Sound","job":"Production Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0213190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1083,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glV5iANc50UKVgT7c0GkLNIOP1P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":12987,"name":"poverty"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
