The reanimated corpse has been a staple of folklore, film, literature and popular culture for nearly 200 years. Join Dr. Emily Zarka, who studies literature and film through the lens of monsters, as she deconstructs some of the most significant moments in zombie popular culture over the last two centuries to reveal what these creatures say about us. In New Orleans, Dr. Zarka explores how zombie folklore arose before it became mainstream and discovers more about the spiritual and historical roots of zombie lore.","popularity":0.0925,"poster_path":"/wJTSbzhoJU3AFJDp2hRuYrCv9F3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91992,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exhumed: A History of Zombies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2444548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Emily Zarka","original_name":"Dr. Emily Zarka","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/plDp7wPOXLDwON6p42D0LpLRF7W.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621421c520e6a5006847f3f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Schulte","original_name":"David Schulte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214214c0499f20042adf279","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tiauna Lewis","original_name":"Tiauna Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621421a83f4833001c9b94de","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2444548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Emily Zarka","original_name":"Dr. Emily Zarka","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/plDp7wPOXLDwON6p42D0LpLRF7W.jpg","credit_id":"6214218c0e4fc8001dcc8c35","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13873644","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1926,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wJTSbzhoJU3AFJDp2hRuYrCv9F3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1284}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
