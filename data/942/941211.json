One day, after cutting a maggot to death, the man's previously dormant madness overflows like a dam and floods him with the next carnage. A maggot, a cockroach, a small dog and a pregnant woman. The film uses black-and-white and colour to depict the mental state of the protagonist as he slowly builds up to the murder. In the last scene, the inner world of the man is symbolically expressed, and the urgency with which he searches for an answer is overwhelming. This is a highly accomplished film, both visually and thematically.","popularity":0.0564,"poster_path":"/Asrw6jYQmW02kJtINFOXqPBauxf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EXIT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruyoshi Oikawa","original_name":"Haruyoshi Oikawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62124fed3f483300446ca5d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":554576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fukumi Kuroda","original_name":"黒田福美","popularity":0.2284,"profile_path":"/eVc3GY2xWUSov7XEYmoNswLXIoX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62124ff320e6a50068427119","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saburo Teshigahara","original_name":"Saburo Teshigahara","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62124ff8f6fd18001c37b1e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshikazu Kotakebayashi","original_name":"Yoshikazu Kotakebayashi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62125000a39d0b001b40ae15","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Katsuren","original_name":"Takemi Katsuren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124fcd20e6a50042bd8085","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Katsuren","original_name":"Takemi Katsuren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124fbb81a7fc0042471634","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435320,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naohiro Ikemiya","original_name":"Ikemiya Naohiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124fd93f483300446ca5ac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takemi Katsuren","original_name":"Takemi Katsuren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124fc7a39d0b006c17ebec","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435321,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takeuchi Jun","original_name":"Takeuchi Jun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124fe420e6a50042bd80e2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Asrw6jYQmW02kJtINFOXqPBauxf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
