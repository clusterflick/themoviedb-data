The two actors Mokhallad Rasem and Kuno Bakker conduct a series of dialogues about their relationship with each other and their environment. A quest of two wandering souls for common ground. Together, the conversations tell an overarching story about two men who, despite their differences, explore where their lives touch and enrich each other. Or where they might have to leave each other alone. In the candid conversation that arises around these differences, the public is invited to contribute ideas and determine their own position.","popularity":0.0921,"poster_path":"/h7m5hiwRJF2eUj11nqivaEXr1Wz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dood Paard","origin_country":""},{"id":108345,"logo_path":null,"name":"TONEELHUIS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dood Paard: De Verse Tijd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuno Bakker","original_name":"Kuno Bakker","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6213ee8dd3d387006b2d4750","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mokhallad Rasem","original_name":"Mokhallad Rasem","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6213ee930929f60069ad7da7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3265985,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Bosteels","original_name":"Jan Bosteels","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213ef9e3f4833001c9b0c49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3265985,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Bosteels","original_name":"Jan Bosteels","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213efa66e3deb004219435a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437626,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Julian Maiwald","original_name":"Julian Maiwald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213ef7a41465c0044c003c0","department":"Crew","job":"Projection"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437627,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maxim Hectors","original_name":"Maxim Hectors","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213efb34284ea001ade7e01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437626,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Julian Maiwald","original_name":"Julian Maiwald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213ef6e383df2001bcae1ae","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437633,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iwan Van Vlierberghe","original_name":"Iwan Van Vlierberghe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213f12ab84cdd00434aebc2","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuno Bakker","original_name":"Kuno Bakker","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213f1460bb076001bfeffcf","department":"Art","job":"Production Illustrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mokhallad Rasem","original_name":"Mokhallad Rasem","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213eedb1b7294006bf7dd91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuno Bakker","original_name":"Kuno Bakker","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213eed341465c006c66985b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7m5hiwRJF2eUj11nqivaEXr1Wz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer De verse tijd","key":"1ZXu7S9g_AY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-28T10:51:44.000Z","id":"6213f1ea20e6a50042c2746b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"De verse tijd door Dood Paard en Toneelhuis","key":"3Me7TILICws","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-19T13:54:55.000Z","id":"6213f005c9044c001b433a1e"}]}}}
