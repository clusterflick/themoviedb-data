The film unfolds in a gentle rhythm of independent episodes, such as his interactions with his friends over compulsory reports and job-hunting activities, the beautiful young man he is interested in for some reason, and a visit from his sister. In addition, by placing the characters in the distance, the surrounding space is incorporated into the picture, and the freshness characteristic of early summer is expressed in a natural way. In combination with the unusual character of the protagonist, Sabu, the film depicts his \"uneventful\" daily life in an unhurried manner, and it is a strange work that draws the viewer in.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":"/4fCzDtFhawIF6xk9PqOkf6tLuVp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Early Summer in 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuyama Yoko","original_name":"Chuyama Yoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6212531f44a424001f5db548","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurimoto Wakako","original_name":"Kurimoto Wakako","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6212532481a7fc006c6631a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sawara Takashi","original_name":"Sawara Takashi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6212532c3f483300446cb02a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamoshita Toshiharu","original_name":"Kamoshita Toshiharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6212533381a7fc006c6631f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaji Hideki","original_name":"Kaji Hideki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6212533aa84ff70020d89764","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","original_name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6212534b20e6a50068427d0d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","original_name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621252f544a424001f5db4b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","original_name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125300e92d83001b469196","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","original_name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212530520e6a5001bcada6d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaji Hideki","original_name":"Kaji Hideki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621253421d5386006990503b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamoshita Toshiharu","original_name":"Kamoshita Toshiharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621253c7e0ca7f006ad0ca7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","original_name":"Katsutoshi Sabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621253d389b561004229c7ba","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4fCzDtFhawIF6xk9PqOkf6tLuVp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
