Shoutaro's best friend, Yosuke, and his girlfriend, Kyoko, are at a loss as to what to do. The film is a fresh take on an ordinary scene in Tokyo. The fuzzy pain of a man and a woman who have lost their best friend and their lover is expressed in a refreshing and poignant way. The director's skill in giving life to the bicycle as a prop and letting it tell the story of Shotaro's existence and the delicate relationship between Kyoko and Yosuke shines through.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/b1yiKAYntMZxqJ3XvrmWlow4vp5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Over by bicycle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yutaka Okagaki","original_name":"Yutaka Okagaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6212635803f0b600687e156c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsuyoshi Kamishiro","original_name":"Tsuyoshi Kamishiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6212635e1089ba0068d43aa8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuko Miura","original_name":"Yuko Miura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621263631089ba00434c94b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiko Ogita","original_name":"Michiko Ogita","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6212636981a7fc006c666b86","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun Kawanishi","original_name":"Jun Kawanishi","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621262c20e4fc8006bb7a034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun Kawanishi","original_name":"Jun Kawanishi","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621262c896670e006ba8ca65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun Kawanishi","original_name":"Jun Kawanishi","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621262e7f6fd18006a172c9c","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisuke Yamamoto","original_name":"山本大輔","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621263461d5386001cec684f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tada Takuji","original_name":"Tada Takuji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212635103f0b6004234c1b5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b1yiKAYntMZxqJ3XvrmWlow4vp5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
