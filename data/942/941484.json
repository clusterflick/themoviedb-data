The wife is a curio fiend, and demands that Harris secure the scimitar, but the husband, having read in his guidebook that the scimitar was supposedly presented to the prophet in a vision and that the vengeance of Allah will follow whosoever disturbs it, begs her to abandon the foolish idea. She insists. That night Harris enters the temple with a rope ladder, steals the scimitar and escapes.","popularity":0.1758,"poster_path":"/avop0FLSOYS96gmZ98AgqJnZXUS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scimitar of the Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Foxe","original_name":"Earle Foxe","popularity":0.2844,"profile_path":"/2OfIJekN8qQFGdku0C520UEoHxR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harris - a Tourist","credit_id":"6212ee7df6fd1800426ec2cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Hollister","original_name":"Alice Hollister","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/slnfkeqsIGVsbNJlIgShI8X2V0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doris Harris - his wife","credit_id":"6212ee8a1089ba00434ec064","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert G.
