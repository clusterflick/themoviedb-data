The builders and witnesses of the station's creation reminisce on the years of construction, which became a \"school of life\" for those involved. Doctors talk about the excellent ecological state of the environment near the station, youths ski in the nearby snowy woods. The \"big happy family of the atomohrad\" celebrate the New Year.
