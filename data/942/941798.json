After a night of gambling he returns, penniless, to his apartment. He is on the point of ending everything when his bell rings and he finds an abandoned baby on his doorstep. Steve and his valet, Hodges, attempt to pacify the child. The distracted mother, who has hoped to place the little one in a comfortable home, repents her act and comes to Steve's house, begging that the child be returned. Steve complies with her request and secretly follows her home. He sees that she lives in a disreputable tenement and finds a note from her husband's father, in which the latter states that the marriage was against his wishes and that the young woman has no claim upon him.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/9NBk3Nsffx1c1eqlsVeSVO4R2Pz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Stolen Identity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Vincent","original_name":"James Vincent","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bigHThNztXB7ErbOr75OpR4gx2q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Steve Carnes","credit_id":"6213b3cf9f5dfb006cfc9a2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Hollister","original_name":"Alice Hollister","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/slnfkeqsIGVsbNJlIgShI8X2V0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mildred Anderson","credit_id":"6213b3de0cd44600692c0c53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Hallam","original_name":"Henry Hallam","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/1vuGLaEru3R9DBLBpy1nOG0EDsO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hodges - a Valet","credit_id":"6213b3ece0ca7f001b77eeb7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Mackin","original_name":"John Mackin","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Andrew Carnes - Steve's Father","credit_id":"6213b3fd9f5dfb001b2f33c6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert G.
