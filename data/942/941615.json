Audiences at the Moulin Rouge where first shocked, then won over, by this tall, mustachioed man in a red velvet suit...a suite with a hole cut in the derriere to release his remarkable talent. Pujol was a skilled musician in his own right, but his greatest instrument was his own rectum, with which he could produce an astounding variety of musical tones. Through a combination of historical documents, photographs, archival films, and interviews, this video reclaims Pujol's place in history and, in the process, opens up a veritable Pandora's box of contemporary debate over the meaning, impact, and value of this unusual master flatulator.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le petomane: Fin de siècle fartiste","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0250656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
