This is one of those men who have to uproot themselves and leave their families to be able to work. How many of them have the terrible feeling that they are wasting their life to earn it? Exemplary suppliers, anonymous workers, nomadic builders, they move from factory to dam, from one site to the next and form a society apart. Every day, these men have to rise to the occasion. Each evening, they have to tame the loneliness a little more.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/n8dFmgqxbTT7zsxm0jleTfeQkJo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon père","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danic Champoux","original_name":"Danic Champoux","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1Ho2dRYdLj4jL5RtMyvSRKFNTmi.jpg","credit_id":"6213ab390e4fc800440d0d4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437349,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Lachapelle","original_name":"Pierre Lachapelle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213af53dfe31d006e393ca2","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389169,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Suzanne Allard","original_name":"Suzanne Allard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213af6b41465c001b8c35e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serge Bouvier","original_name":"Serge Bouvier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213af89e0ca7f001b77e16a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011661,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Vincelette","original_name":"François Vincelette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213af25d3d387001c88238f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Gladu","original_name":"André Gladu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213ab68813831006e0fd7f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2745851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie Tougas","original_name":"Anne-Marie Tougas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213afc08138310042d5fe82","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189606,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marie-Claude Gagné","original_name":"Marie-Claude Gagné","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213afa41a3248006ab9485b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michèle Pérusse","original_name":"Michèle Pérusse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213aba42dc44e00417b6615","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danic Champoux","original_name":"Danic Champoux","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/1Ho2dRYdLj4jL5RtMyvSRKFNTmi.jpg","credit_id":"6213ab503f4833004470d668","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46440,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Vialard","original_name":"Jean-Paul Vialard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213aff341465c0044bf3d66","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6GpDFOMmsw8quB83XkV5CdNTL4F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8dFmgqxbTT7zsxm0jleTfeQkJo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
