As it’s taking a while, the wet-nurse is asked to take the baby on a short walk before the ceremony begins. She comes across a handsome young soldier, who she strikes up a conversation with. When an even more handsome man passes by, she hands the baby to the soldier. He has to return to the barracks, so he finds someone to leave the baby with. As time passes, the party start to wonder where the baby is. Fortunately, the baby has been handed in at the police station, where the parents reunite with their child.
