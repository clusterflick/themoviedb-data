The studio is built to resemble the official marriage room of the registration office in Helsinki where people have half an hour to get married with the presence of two witnesses. The video deals with the theatrical aspect of a wedding ceremony by using different elements like lighting, movement of the camera and the expressions of the performers – who are playing a familiar act but in an unfamiliar situation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Do Things With Words (A Legal Performance)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bita Razav","original_name":"Bita Razav","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621258c9e92d83001b46a29f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
