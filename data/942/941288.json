He wanders around trying to find his own Chieko and meets the woman of his dreams, Chako. But Chako rejects him and runs away. In pursuit of her, he turns himself into a black-cloaked immortal monster and falls into a world of madness and illusion. Makoto falls into a world of madness and fantasy, and assassins are unleashed on him. The hellish pilgrimage that stains the stage of Chieko Sho with blood finally comes to an end in the back streets of Ginza. In this literary, action, comic, suspense, and horror film, Nishigaya, who was a rugby player in high school and competed in the Hanazono (flower garden), charges ahead with the same power he had on the field. The nosebleeds that boldly flutter in the wind and Kotaro's poem that plays throughout the film cross over to create a unique entertainment that drags the viewer into a different dimension.","popularity":0.0771,"poster_path":"/pubSGrA8AGIazFSu7OdOQQOWN6l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BARA-BA LOVER BOY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ihara Atsuya","original_name":"Ihara Atsuya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"621524b50e4fc8001dcf40f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakuraba Koji","original_name":"Sakuraba Koji","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"621524c2383df2001bcd9600","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uchino Hiroko","original_name":"Uchino Hiroko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621524cb323eba001eb757a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasaoka Atsushi","original_name":"Sasaoka Atsushi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621524d30e4fc8006bbef1d2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nishigaya Juichi","original_name":"Nishigaya Juichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215253c323eba006c60f2c7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438958,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seki Hajinobu","original_name":"Seki Hajinobu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621524e64284ea001ae160cc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":406706,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","original_name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621524f944a424001f6582a6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":406706,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","original_name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215251b9f5dfb006c006bdf","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshikazu Nishigaya","original_name":"西ヶ谷寿一","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624724b6fd6fa100a1d82211","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshikazu Nishigaya","original_name":"西ヶ谷寿一","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624724afc4ad59009f7a8ea8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pubSGrA8AGIazFSu7OdOQQOWN6l.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nMSGeN9YjxBZ0F7CNl2oYpfDlmP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
