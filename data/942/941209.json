In his hometown in Kansai, he meets a high school girl. The film tells the story of the moratorium of youth through the connection of seemingly unrelated episodes between the young man and the girl. A truck driving through the city, a teacher from high school, an exchange with the girl. The film is full of transparency, with a conscious interplay between black and white and colour, as if it were a mental picture of the young man himself. In the last scene, the girl turns the 8mm camera on herself, and her face, enveloped in light, is refreshing.","popularity":0.0815,"poster_path":"/oT33ZlLKGebndHLZl5CWRlvWoCs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Drifting Man and A Wandering Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imanishi Keiko","original_name":"Imanishi Keiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62124ebde0ca7f006ad0ba7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Kumai","original_name":"隈井士門","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/8DExh2TlQRz6is3mCiEBRlBppwZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62124ec63f4833006b7d31e1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3435312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichi Matsunaga","original_name":"Koichi Matsunaga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124e0c20e6a5001bcaca91","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Makoto Hagiwara","original_name":"Makoto Hagiwara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124ea744a4240046cb03f1","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shiori Kazama","original_name":"風間志織","popularity":0.0834,"profile_path":"/7Ys0hur7hY7QT5GK7X6aUNMo5WZ.jpg","credit_id":"62124ee089b561006be13f6c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3435312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichi Matsunaga","original_name":"Koichi Matsunaga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124e0020e6a5001bcaca5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3435312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichi Matsunaga","original_name":"Koichi Matsunaga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124e07a84ff70020d885da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Makoto Hagiwara","original_name":"Makoto Hagiwara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124ea196670e001be34d7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808976,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Akihiko Suzuki","original_name":"Akihiko Suzuki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62124eb541465c001b88019f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oT33ZlLKGebndHLZl5CWRlvWoCs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
