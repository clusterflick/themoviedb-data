We witness her as she presents a diary-style monologue detailing her feelings of resentment, their facade of love, and how the toxic cycle of their relationship can only be broken by its demise. Scenes switch between present, past and future as the characters - both individually and as a couple - display the emotional effects of aching loss and the pain of separation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hOwNrAeloEWAVUQEDKDZe660wpu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Confronting the realization that a relationship is over, from the woman's point of view.","title":"Sleepwalking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micaela Mclucas","original_name":"Micaela Mclucas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6213bf2b0e4fc800440d44c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Kuzmickas","original_name":"Simon Kuzmickas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6213bf3cc9044c001b429bd5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214668f4284ea0068bd9459","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214667841465c006c68157c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6214666ae640d6001dd33c10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3437372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lang","original_name":"Robert Lang","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213bee70cd4460044225cc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12406354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hOwNrAeloEWAVUQEDKDZe660wpu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
