The little tot creeps to the nearby railroad station and resumes her nap in one of the flower beds. Mrs. Hastings, a wealthy widow, is taking an early morning train, after having spent several weeks at an eastern summer resort. She reaches the station before train time and while strolling about, she discovers little Elsie. While she is fondling the little one, the train arrives and Mrs. Hastings, who has no child of her own, cannot master the temptation to take this baby with her. Upon arriving in the west, Mrs. Hastings learns from a newspaper of the strange disappearance of Elsie Mason.","popularity":0.1851,"poster_path":"/jhXSbplVce8LZxhS599AxZ7fGqq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strange Story of Elsie Mason","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1126366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Joyce","original_name":"Alice Joyce","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":"/kwMrZqYXmnOmorAbL0nWhTQykjP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elsie Mason / Christine Hastings","credit_id":"62141e06b84cdd006e5a70a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Moore","original_name":"Tom Moore","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/kFvjLdK2Tcw7cUbWcLo5vQeS0Bd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack Hollis","credit_id":"62141e16b84cdd006e5a70c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Young","original_name":"Lucille Young","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/b22d4sw1eRVljNIlQS9MjLhlaug.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Hastings","credit_id":"62141e240499f20068017d55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baby Grace Foley","original_name":"Baby Grace Foley","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Elsie Mason as a Child","credit_id":"62141e36e0ca7f00437bd57b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edmund Lawrence","original_name":"Edmund Lawrence","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62141df60499f20042ade85e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234816","wikidata_id":"Q3989500","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTZ1GtprZ1cOO8QccK5MXWJrsDT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jhXSbplVce8LZxhS599AxZ7fGqq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
