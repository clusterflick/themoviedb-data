The city has forgotten the hustle and bustle of everyday life, and only the cicadas echo in the streets. The men in yellow helmets, Kagawa and his senior, Saito, arrive. We're the only ones working now, aren't we? The conversation between the two part-timers at the gardener's shop is always in a deadlock. But no matter how much they curse each other, they can't be separated forever. Because he is a ground-bound spirit. They have no choice but to live alone in the city. In the treetop of a big tree, Kagawa's arm, dripping with fresh blood, sways in the wind. In an empty landscape that could be anywhere in Japan, the sad emptiness of people whose existence has been forgotten hangs in the air... Neither horror nor comedy, this is a new genre of splatter labour movie.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/R7CiIYVIiaB0ZVj9rgxZEmJV4s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kuriyama Landscaping","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"16t","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saito Shingo","original_name":"Saito Shingo","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"621528c7dfe31d001b7c9c1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kagawa Hisashi","original_name":"Kagawa Hisashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"621528d163d713001cd4b93f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438989,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Fujii Kyo","original_name":"Fujii Kyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621528ef0e4fc8001dcf51e1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moriishi Kazushi","original_name":"Moriishi Kazushi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621529273f4833001c9e49d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moriishi Kazushi","original_name":"Moriishi Kazushi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62152922dfe31d001b7c9d36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moriishi Kazushi","original_name":"Moriishi Kazushi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6215292d9f5dfb006c007a41","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/R7CiIYVIiaB0ZVj9rgxZEmJV4s.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xgopgfQTvOCvXTUix4h75vVMtou.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
