According to the artists, this network would bring about the destruction of objects as status symbols, the elimination of the city as an accumulation of formal structures of power, and the end of specialized and repetitive work as an alienating activity. \"The logical consequence,\" they write, \"will be a new, revolutionary society in which everyone should find the full development of his possibilities\".","popularity":1.0137,"poster_path":"/p6PmgCW9gQ5w6Srb6xfSXnj48mm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Superstudio (Group)","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supersurface: An Alternative Model for Life on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Life, Supersurface","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Superstudio","original_name":"Superstudio","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621372b10e4fc8001dca9e27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32267043","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p6PmgCW9gQ5w6Srb6xfSXnj48mm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3469,"name":"utopia"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
