The protagonist, Ryoji, wavers between several girlfriends while maintaining a delicate relationship between \"more than a friend, less than a lover\". Their youth is in full bloom. But the day will come when they will have to say goodbye to their flexible relationship. The anxiety and emptiness of a young man who has taken the first step on the road to adulthood are portrayed with such naturalism and freshness that one wonders if it was staged.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iqMMnYtNfIHYDoHGGYMShTzV7XU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Than Friends, Less Than Loves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"MORE THAN FRIEND, LESS THAN LOVER","type":"English title from Pia Film Festival website"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yokoi Madoka","original_name":"Yokoi Madoka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62125113e0ca7f006ad0c1ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Endo Keisuke","original_name":"Endo Keisuke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62125119f6fd1800426c9996","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kabasawa Miharu","original_name":"Kabasawa Miharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6212512344a424001f5daedd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4150607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rika Gotō","original_name":"Rika Gotō","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64a77056f9253200aee34b62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoji Kenjiro","original_name":"Ryoji Kenjiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6212513189b561006be146b7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","original_name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621250f33f483300446ca908","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","original_name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621250fbe92d8300428dacdd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","original_name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212510044a424001f5dadd0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","original_name":"Toshiyuki Kuroiwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125105f6fd18001c37b521","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435335,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Igarashi Takemizu","original_name":"Igarashi Takemizu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6212513a1d5386004303d49e","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398196,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Takahashi Yoshiaki","original_name":"Takahashi Yoshiaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125145f6fd18001c37b629","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iqMMnYtNfIHYDoHGGYMShTzV7XU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
