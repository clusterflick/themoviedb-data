She says it's to meet someone she likes. Koichi is reluctant to go, but he has no choice but to borrow a car from his friend. This is how their journey begins. A love story in an off-the-map town, with a light touch on the relationships between men and women of the time, such as Assi-kun and Keep-kun. With the addition of stylish props such as Koichi's room, his friend's car, and the breakwater in Kujira-cho, a bit of whimsical dialogue, and background music that shows a thorough attention to music selection, the film is a road movie with an experiential beat.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/l4OkCr2qk5eKr9k00yMljOhRZki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Circle Ronin-gai","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dusky Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryôji Okamoto","original_name":"Ryôji Okamoto","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621263b889b561001b7feb28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murayama Toshiro","original_name":"Murayama Toshiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621263bd0e4fc8001dc72153","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miyata Sachiko","original_name":"Miyata Sachiko","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621263c344a4240046cb52a8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3043170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hoshino Tetsuya","original_name":"Hoshino Tetsuya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621263ca20e6a5001bcb1534","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shiota Taizo","original_name":"Shiota Taizo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621263913f4833001c963ad7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shiota Taizo","original_name":"Shiota Taizo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621263961089ba00434c954f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atsushi Miyazawa","original_name":"Atsushi Miyazawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621263a41d5386001cec6989","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l4OkCr2qk5eKr9k00yMljOhRZki.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
