Some of Malmö’s most iconic DIY spots have become world famous in the skate community, but these cultural icons are gradually disappearing to make way for residential developments. Cue a crew of ex-pat skaters from France, USA, England and beyond who take up the DIY mantle and attempt to build their own space with their own rules. Pig Barrier stemmed from a mystery man called “Skater Pig” who built the small first part of a skate spot. This is where an expat crew comes in and attempts to expand on the efforts of Skater Pig.
