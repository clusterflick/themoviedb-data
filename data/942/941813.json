The mechanical reproduction of this miraculous breath is ensured by skilled hands, which care for, build and restore the individual parts of the musical instrument, giving it a new lease of life.  The centuries-old knowledge of the art of organ building, handed down from generation to generation, finds its home in a workshop in the district of Segariu, a small town in the Marmilla region, at the gateway to central Sardinia.  Beyond the craftsmanship process there seems to be an invisible and unstoppable motion that survives the millennia: the pursuit of the breath of nature, the wind, which for the ancient Greeks (Πνεúµα) was also the spirit.","popularity":0.4812,"poster_path":"/9kixsniyOjr2HMydvMODzbI01U2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pneuma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Palmas","original_name":"Giuseppe Palmas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6213c04d2dc44e006c70f7c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Palmas","original_name":"Roberto Palmas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6213c055a39d0b004248a43d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Diana","original_name":"Alberto Diana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213bfcc1a3248004453e8e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francesca Ajossa","original_name":"Francesca Ajossa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213c03e20e6a5001bcf20f9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437429,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giovanni Stefano Masala","original_name":"Giovanni Stefano Masala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213c02d9f5dfb001b2f56b1","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Diana","original_name":"Alberto Diana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213bfa90e4fc8001dcb6449","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437427,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alessandro Fanari","original_name":"Alessandro Fanari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6213c001a39d0b006c1c7422","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Federica Ortu","original_name":"Federica Ortu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aca20b53eaa9c0fe44ccbe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9kixsniyOjr2HMydvMODzbI01U2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
