He summons up his courage and stands in front of the automatic door, trying to be a perfect urbanite. The cynical dialogue has a unique rhythm and fires like a machine gun. The screen, which never stops changing, merges and engages the audience, shouting out what a metropolis is and what humanity is all about. Matsuo embraces his Dutch wife and swims out to sea alone, only the cold waves gently enveloping him.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/hgzyzYVDtyVKtoJeWyV56Lwog3r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Convenience Papa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hina Hayashi","original_name":"Hina Hayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6212610d96670e001be388bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaori Haruno","original_name":"Kaori Haruno","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621261114e52ed001da0918b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tokomako","original_name":"Tokomako","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621261171089ba00434c8c6d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsubaki Oshima","original_name":"Tsubaki Oshima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6212611d41465c006c621226","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118779,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuji Nagamori","original_name":"永森裕二","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/qdDpX0SEiuuMxblHVNRf3u9Kjdg.jpg","credit_id":"621260f041465c001b88428e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118779,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuji Nagamori","original_name":"永森裕二","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/qdDpX0SEiuuMxblHVNRf3u9Kjdg.jpg","credit_id":"621260f6a84ff7006d2608fa","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435452,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Suzuki Mamoru","original_name":"Suzuki Mamoru","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621261063f4833006b7d6ca8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118779,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuji Nagamori","original_name":"永森裕二","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/qdDpX0SEiuuMxblHVNRf3u9Kjdg.jpg","credit_id":"621260fca84ff700475bbdc5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hgzyzYVDtyVKtoJeWyV56Lwog3r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
