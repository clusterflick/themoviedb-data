The attempt to cross the ridge between the main peak and Nanda Devi East resulted in the death of two members of the expedition. Expedition leader Roger Duplat and Gilbert Vignes disappear on the ridge somewhere below the main peak. Tenzing Norgay is part of a support team on this expedition; he and Louis Dubost climb Nanda Devi Est in search of the two missing people. A few years later, Tenzing discovered that Nanda Devi was the most difficult climb he had ever made.","popularity":0.3631,"poster_path":"/fKg952qMp8M9oG1UBPGxIegbsaN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Himalayan Epic","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Duplat","original_name":"Roger Duplat","popularity":0.0476,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"621404ae2dc44e001bc08038","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Vignes","original_name":"Gilbert Vignes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621404b29f5dfb006cfd89b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Barbezat","original_name":"Alain Barbezat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621404be2dc44e006c71bf4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Dubost","original_name":"Louis Dubost","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621404c5e640d6001dd1f391","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gendre","original_name":"Paul Gendre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621404d02dc44e001bc080ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Gevril","original_name":"Louis Gevril","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621404d50e4fc8006bbc3b7f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Languepin","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Languepin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/iYQSpE1RuQskPGFtRWglJ9ESoNf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621404df0499f20042ada337","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Payan","original_name":"Louis Payan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"621404e60cd446004423328d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenzing Norgay","original_name":"Tenzing Norgay","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"621404f83f4833006b81fffe","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Mitchell","original_name":"Leslie Mitchell","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62140507e640d60044c94320","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Languepin","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Languepin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/iYQSpE1RuQskPGFtRWglJ9ESoNf.jpg","credit_id":"6214049ee0ca7f00437b88a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4938724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3QIOUzbReeVDV3GQjV5y0RkCGM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/fKg952qMp8M9oG1UBPGxIegbsaN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":309344,"name":"mountain accident"},{"id":315591,"name":"french expedition"},{"id":346915,"name":"nanda devi"},{"id":346918,"name":"french alpinism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
