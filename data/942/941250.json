They are sensitive, fragile, and the cruellest of creatures. The protagonist, Mizuki, is a third-year student at an all-girls school. She secretly has feelings for her classmate Terumi. When Terumi's boyfriend breaks up with her, Mizuki gently hugs her and comforts her as she cries... Mizuki's keen observation of the pseudo-romance between girls, combined with the natural acting of the girls in the cast, makes for a very realistic \"picture book of high school girl life\". The softly beautiful scenes of the two girls walking through a residential area in midsummer, wearing yukata at a fair, and on a Christmas night are as impressive as a painting.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":"/nQHnQAI8BFAOnahJVfRyZ9EpVeY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Group Love","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring Has Come","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tahara Takushi","original_name":"Tahara Takushi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62125f5941465c001b883bff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsui Riko","original_name":"Mitsui Riko","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62125f5fa84ff7006d260496","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mishiro Yoko","original_name":"Mishiro Yoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62125f651089ba00434c8761","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Araki Takako","original_name":"Araki Takako","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62125f6a03f0b6001b68c0c0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Kuma","original_name":"Shinji Kuma","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125f4520e6a5001bcb0581","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1988604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyoshi Takishima","original_name":"Hiroyoshi Takishima","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125f1b481382001bb177ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Kuma","original_name":"Shinji Kuma","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62125f4941465c006c620cb4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nQHnQAI8BFAOnahJVfRyZ9EpVeY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
