In this engrossing documentary, LeMond looks back at the pivotal 1986 Tour, and his increasingly vicious rivalry with friend, teammate, and mentor Bernard Hinault. The reigning Tour champion and brutal competitor known as “The Badger,” Hinault ‘promised’ to help LeMond to his first victory, in return for LeMond supporting him in the previous year. But in a sport that purports to reward teamwork, it’s really every man for himself.","popularity":0.5474,"poster_path":"/xIXA8NBVRlhBqfP7ypmcvguTFSn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slaying the Badger","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg LeMond","original_name":"Greg LeMond","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/hMn9DGhXvVyNdqXSiY1gHuPm5EB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5335b1e8c3a3682ab50051b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Hinault","original_name":"Bernard Hinault","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/2Fobac53D0EnY5FgQ5ZgkcXVTHy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53dd843c0e0a265a93000b22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4225385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Köchli","original_name":"Paul Köchli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e29058e19de9013a291c8b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy LeMond","original_name":"Kathy LeMond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e28cedb77d4b11401b83d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Liggett","original_name":"Phil Liggett","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/3k5WissD3RRqdJ0kxqOKTbeR4qr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e2893c8c0a4800c6c4a089","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Tesh","original_name":"John Tesh","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/m3y37syV01xBYc3nwkyQwB7i747.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64e285b7a3b5e601d59f27d9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388435,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Packer","original_name":"Nick Packer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e291a6e19de9013a291cff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dower","original_name":"John Dower","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5335b1b9c3a3682ab50051a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dower","original_name":"John Dower","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5335b1c4c3a3682a8e0053a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3793686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vIyu26h074mZIDaPCQdIObYNk3t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oxvERZinK2eCTLbx4HifSc9l48K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlddk9JbUHOUT0kciW0qiZGVL0n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w6dIuPWKXZpaEdqo8NqxiE5ty91.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.427,"height":1285,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8aqQn6vxEcyVqc0oL6JBlKvKWhe.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3119},{"aspect_ratio":2.427,"height":1285,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nn2uLLuo78gimvwI1GeQOAjXAG9.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3119}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xIXA8NBVRlhBqfP7ypmcvguTFSn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2mxG3hAWPMNPZAw0QYPAZIdAB8t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8633,"name":"tour de france"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Disney+","release_date":"2021-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
