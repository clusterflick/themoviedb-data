But Ashok loves Kokila, who belongs to a poor family and sells flowers for a livelihood. Ashok decides to carry on his love with Kokila and at the same time witnesses the hilarious goings-on at his residence when the dads, mom, and the brides-to-be assemble - all from different parts of India - all speaking a different language.
