When a desperate act to obtain leaked exam papers ends in disgrace, Narashimaachari vows to restore his honor and prepare his son honestly. But tragedy strikes on the day of the exam, plunging the family into grief. A year later, a fugitive thief named Anand—who looks exactly like the late Varadhukutty—takes refuge in their home. Asked to impersonate the dead son to comfort his mentally ill mother, Anand slowly transforms under the family's care. When the truth about the past emerges, the fragile bonds they’ve rebuilt are put to the test.","popularity":0.3544,"poster_path":"/4p8P6zrHl3Zyd1uIX5wAS3FK14e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paritchaikku Neramaachu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sivaji Ganesan","original_name":"Sivaji Ganesan","popularity":0.4641,"profile_path":"/tZSFLnqftW5p0Rq2p2DCk6iyVt4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narashimaachari","credit_id":"5332dd17c3a3686a8600429c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sujatha","original_name":"Sujatha","popularity":0.359,"profile_path":"/27RTtumMOiolzRLTeKEWBTZsQRy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vedha, Narashimaachari's wife","credit_id":"5332dd19c3a3686aa5004343","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thengai Srinivasan","original_name":"Thengai Srinivasan","popularity":0.2235,"profile_path":"/ri71dy01Qo8ptHbQXByxzpMmo3Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anantharaman","credit_id":"5332dd1ac3a3686a780043d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Y.
