The rough and simplistic concrete pier braves pacific storms and provides stillness and stability. People come to walk, to fish and ease their minds. The film takes a closer look at the diverse people all around the pier. Among them the filmmakers find two citizens, both immigrants, who take us on their personal journey through history.","popularity":0.0595,"poster_path":"/37rIE0pP8QWK6S1cIMNdWiGmRK0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boulevard's End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nora Fingscheidt","original_name":"Nora Fingscheidt","popularity":0.2834,"profile_path":"/wjf96BGhggmdxiZVxOVJzWWVoq0.jpg","credit_id":"53333d989251410b51004080","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433364,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philip Leutert","original_name":"Philip Leutert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f250ed9251416b380026f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nora Fingscheidt","original_name":"Nora Fingscheidt","popularity":0.2834,"profile_path":"/wjf96BGhggmdxiZVxOVJzWWVoq0.jpg","credit_id":"54f250e09251416b2c00289d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3510736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/37rIE0pP8QWK6S1cIMNdWiGmRK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
