Filmmaker Mason Booker travels across the country and into Gen Con's final year in Milwaukee to find out who the people are behind the games, and what about role-playing has transformed it from a pastime into a complete subculture. By including original animation and interviews with Gary Gygax, Chris Clark, Tony D and Brom, Life with the Dicebag overviews what role-playing is all about yet it still stays close to the heart of the industry: the devotion of its loyal fans.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life with the Dice Bag","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mason Booker","original_name":"Mason Booker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e47819925141195a00b346","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0806111","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
