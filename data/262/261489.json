Keli is forced to marry Wesa but has a lover in another village. This causes war to break out between the two villages and Wesa is killed. Wesa's father Meo now wants Keli to marry his other son. Keli refuses and the hostilities continue. Just when the authorities have locked up a number of troublemakers, Father Jacobs arrives. The missionary tries to win the confidence of the locals but becomes embroiled in the conflict. An assault by Meo's men leaves him dangerously wounded. The villagers stop fighting and Meo asks the dying missionary's forgiveness.","popularity":0.2676,"poster_path":"/8Gw1b4n0AXMcUJDkvp4EgKS1sw3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soverdi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1932-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amorira","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"haat en liefde bij de bamboeboschbewoners van Borado-Likowali eiland Flores","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Love and Hate in the Bamboo Forest of Borado-Likowali, Flores Island","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diroe Doka","original_name":"Diroe Doka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lover","credit_id":"53341e0dc3a3682a87001f32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keli Kadoe","original_name":"Keli Kadoe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lover","credit_id":"53341e1dc3a3680a1e00187b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tjeke Ladja","original_name":"Tjeke Ladja","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Leader of the Borado","credit_id":"53341e32c3a3682abb001e28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paroe Meo","original_name":"Paroe Meo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Father of the rival Waroe Wesa","credit_id":"53341e44c3a3682a87001f39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waroe Wesa","original_name":"Waroe Wesa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rival","credit_id":"53341e57c3a3682abb001e2d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kadoe Woga","original_name":"Kadoe Woga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Keli's father","credit_id":"53341e67c3a3680a1e001886","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacobs","original_name":"Jacobs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pastor Missionaris","credit_id":"61ee700ae9da69001cc728c7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Buis","original_name":"Simon Buis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/15MhFTExHRHFRCSuHmEqVOzC1S6.jpg","credit_id":"53341ddfc3a3682abb001e22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305006,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piet Beltjens","original_name":"Piet Beltjens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ee7028c5ada500fac235fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1774965,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jaap Kunst","original_name":"Jaap Kunst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ee708ccd2046001b68092c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5492804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Gw1b4n0AXMcUJDkvp4EgKS1sw3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7348,"name":"indonesia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1932-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
