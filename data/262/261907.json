The film documents one winter’s night at the al-Haddad home in the Palestinian town of Hebron. A group of soldiers arrives for a routine night search there, for reasons unknown to the family. Diaa and Shatha al-Hadaad, brother and sister, pick up the home video camera and record the events as they unfold throughout the night. The soldiers force Diaa to stand facing a wall, saying they won’t leave unless he stops smiling.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/uXMoO64affCJjziFm8o1WuSwPWx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smile, and the World Will Smile Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3509672","wikidata_id":"Q84501445","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uXMoO64affCJjziFm8o1WuSwPWx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs Trailers 2014: SMILE AND THE WORLD WILL SMILE BACK","key":"940T6vq5pFA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-03-18T14:02:31.000Z","id":"62c37651a313b8007cc9b3ce"}]}}}
