To do that, I had to create my own (all encompassing) vehicle. By my count, the original sequence provides three orders of motion: the motion (and stillness) of the passengers on the train, the motion of the train itself, and finally the motion of the girl (Joan) outside of the train.","popularity":0.1856,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Possessed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Crawford","original_name":"Joan Crawford","popularity":1.0427,"profile_path":"/AtEGacmejG86ug8tKTxFd7JbJJO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"53310020c3a3686aa5000d41","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Worden","original_name":"Fred Worden","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ivSbWknJuBAioE3dHO5kz21hNup.jpg","credit_id":"5331006ac3a3686aa5000d46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam ","release_date":"2011-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" VIVACI Guarda","release_date":"2011-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VIVACI Caldas da Rainha","release_date":"2011-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VIVACI Maia","release_date":"2011-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art","release_date":"2011-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
