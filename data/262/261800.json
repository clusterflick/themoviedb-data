Somasundaram. The Sivaji Ganesan-L. V. Prasad production was distinct, becoming a cult classic. Karunanidhi virtually rewrote Mudaliar’s play, introducing interesting changes like the climactic sequence for which he drew inspiration from “Samson and Delilah”, especially the part where the blind Samson pushes the pillars down. Mu. Karunanidhi’s writing was superb with a contemporary touch. His dialogue had punch, satire, wit and humour. Sivaji Ganesan was excellent in his dialogue delivery and P. Kannamba who played the queen mother was equally brilliant. Her line, ‘Poruthathu podhum, pongi ezhu, maganey’, became quite famous.","popularity":0.1851,"poster_path":"/xKXq56DJ3yy5TAuf5LqIGmwuXB1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":199,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manohara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sivaji Ganesan","original_name":"Sivaji Ganesan","popularity":0.4641,"profile_path":"/tZSFLnqftW5p0Rq2p2DCk6iyVt4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Manohara","credit_id":"5335af5ec3a3680a1e004c20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Girija","original_name":"Girija","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dfMgJMU0KaUtryMCgyyKLP3o3Dq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Princess","credit_id":"5335af66c3a3682a940052d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
