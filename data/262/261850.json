But fate takes a cruel turn when Muthayyan is wrongfully branded a dacoit and forced to live in hiding within the forest. Despite the danger and distance, Kalyani remains unwavering in her love, and the two dream of escaping together to build a peaceful life as husband and wife.  Their hopes rest on the shoulders of Kamalapathi, a loyal friend and stage actor, who devises a clever plan to outwit the police and help the lovers flee.
