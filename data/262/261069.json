In September 1980, they broke into a General Electric weapons plant in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and in an act of protest against nuclear proliferation, poured vials of their own blood onto secret missile plans, burned other files, and damaged nosecones intended for nuclear missiles. The direct-to-video production is intercut with clips from actual news coverage of the trial. The \"Plowshares Eight\" portray themselves in the production, and after taping was complete, reported to court for their imprisonment.","popularity":0.5165,"poster_path":"/kwmpd97q547XXhs1HPwsnYpjUXF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the King of Prussia","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Judge Samuel Salus II","credit_id":"5330de72c3a3686a8e000589","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1151688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Berrigan","original_name":"Daniel Berrigan","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/9bpZ0qUZiQftofUg42wMAtDuy0S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61508e36fb83460043391550","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Berrigan","original_name":"Philip Berrigan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61508e83e8a3e10043fbf810","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile de Antonio","original_name":"Emile de Antonio","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/jIlluWSIxVJ0A0kuxW7JWujcttU.jpg","credit_id":"5330acf7c3a3686a7f0000f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213254,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Judy Irola","original_name":"Judy Irola","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/pxdAlUcp2xmGjHmynV8At25oMbC.jpg","credit_id":"54004a9d0e0a2658e9001dab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile de Antonio","original_name":"Emile de Antonio","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/jIlluWSIxVJ0A0kuxW7JWujcttU.jpg","credit_id":"54004a870e0a2658db001df9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0084130","wikidata_id":"Q6012363","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.619,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwmpd97q547XXhs1HPwsnYpjUXF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
