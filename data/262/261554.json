These verbatim portrayals bring together adversaries, victims, eyewitnesses, and observers who have never stood within the same four walls, let alone spoken to each other. In her signature performance style, Smith embodies and gives voice to scores of real-life \"characters\" -- from LAPD Police Chief Daryl Gates to a gang member, from Korean store owners to a white juror, from Reginald Denny to Congresswoman Maxine Waters -- black, white, Asian, Latino. Because she is able to speak the words and convey the deeply held sentiments of so many different people, Smith enables her audience members to hear what they might otherwise discount.","popularity":0.5118,"poster_path":"/6abgmd9J8KgzBHDr07KbdhIaK1W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twilight: Los Angeles","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Deavere Smith","original_name":"Anna Deavere Smith","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/rh6fPQJ7Eudb2El7B54bHZdcBQr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5334854b9251414454002327","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Levin","original_name":"Marc Levin","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/mlqZhmWcZ403kyvTgKdLDCMMaj2.jpg","credit_id":"5acc0193925141430301c589","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Deavere Smith","original_name":"Anna Deavere Smith","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/rh6fPQJ7Eudb2El7B54bHZdcBQr.jpg","credit_id":"5acc01ac0e0a26325f01f66e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Deavere Smith","original_name":"Anna Deavere Smith","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/rh6fPQJ7Eudb2El7B54bHZdcBQr.jpg","credit_id":"5acc01d1c3a3687e9501dedb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21968,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ezra Swerdlow","original_name":"Ezra Swerdlow","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5acc01db0e0a2631e701f096","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maryse Alberti","original_name":"Maryse Alberti","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/7pVhst4mBRHDcFytmKZECsVijMR.jpg","credit_id":"5acc01eec3a3687e9501df14","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":116791,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joan Churchill","original_name":"Joan Churchill","popularity":0.3391,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5acc024ac3a3687e0e01d3cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143067,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bob Eisenhardt","original_name":"Bob Eisenhardt","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/am49jBT158NGnaieRIOXnaKZRo9.jpg","credit_id":"5acc025d9251410c48000037","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Camara Kambon","original_name":"Camara Kambon","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5acc02700e0a2631fa01e055","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0237865","wikidata_id":"Q7857954","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6abgmd9J8KgzBHDr07KbdhIaK1W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsbBXqmnPsadGNPVjtiJIqNDVNR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
