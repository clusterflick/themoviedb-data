R. Sundaram, was an interesting film in which Sivaji Ganesan played a role with negative shades. The character dabbles in avenues such as journalism and politics. T. P. Muthulakshmi plays the dumb wife of an elderly husband (K. A. Thangavelu) who goes to work early. Sivaji Ganesan, a seducer, who sneaks into the dumb woman’s house, alters the clock to send the husband away well before the usual time. This sequence was mercilessly scissored by the censors and what was left lost its touch of satire and innuendo!","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1953-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thirumbi Paar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sivaji Ganesan","original_name":"Sivaji Ganesan","popularity":0.4641,"profile_path":"/tZSFLnqftW5p0Rq2p2DCk6iyVt4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5335aa27c3a3682a8700538b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pandari Bai","original_name":"Pandari Bai","popularity":0.2037,"profile_path":"/hQRkAIELIKQihKEeWMVW0j3GHsE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5335aa2fc3a3682a9400527e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.
