Made entirely from archive photographs and footage from the earliest days of moving image, All This Can Happen (2012) follows the footsteps of the protagonist from the short story 'The Walk' by Robert Walser. Juxtapositions, different speeds and split frame techniques convey the walker's state of mind as he encounters a world of hilarity, despair and ceaseless variety.","popularity":0.4218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":225188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Siobhan Davies Dance","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All This Can Happen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Heffernan","original_name":"John Heffernan","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/2fx9fbcZmkT8hqvjXJCDRSCTjTp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5336e729c3a3680e70001366","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Hinton","original_name":"David Hinton","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5336e6f5c3a3680e6900149f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siobhan Davies","original_name":"Siobhan Davies","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5336e6d8c3a3680e76001433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Walser","original_name":"Robert Walser","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660d885415dea0014932f200","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4967341,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Franck Bordese","original_name":"Franck Bordese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f716808aae2a5e7d9207ae","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martha Wailes","original_name":"Martha Wailes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f7168a8aae2a5e7d9207b6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danny McGuire","original_name":"Danny McGuire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f716945315c2d048c1210d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2484848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Killip","original_name":"Matthew Killip","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f716a18aae2a5e7d9207c2","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302774,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chu Li Shewring","original_name":"Chu Li Shewring","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f716b08aae2a5e7d9207cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2798044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":816,"name":"walking"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"},{"id":186849,"name":"literary adaptation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER | All This Can Happen","key":"KMOPMRJiNSQ","published_at":"2013-01-27T16:45:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec730c3a368544800c07f"}]}}}
