Lorinc Parcen Nagy is the offspring of an upper middle class family, whose life is marked by two violent deaths: the suicide of his father and the slaughter of an innocent worker. He breaks with his family and his mother in disgust; she is of weak character, a person who abandoned her own husband. He is also unable to discover the right tone with his colleagues and his lover who is an illegal party worker.","popularity":0.2238,"poster_path":"/7NpWCCHGwvN79yJIqcf5L4jSz7o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Budapest
