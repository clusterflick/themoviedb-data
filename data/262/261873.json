Politicians, athletes, friends, companions, and journalists comment on Bernard's charm, his rise to prominence in sports and politics, and his subsequent trouble with the law. Zenovich becomes fixated on her need to interview Tapie, becoming virtually a stalker in her quest.","popularity":0.3904,"poster_path":"/uvdDgtdITm0fMTSDv09QrMHkYD2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graceful Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Is Bernard Tapie?","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Zenovich","original_name":"Marina Zenovich","popularity":0.2537,"profile_path":"/7NACcjaPJdQs4381vfZoKBdPx7x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5335f18f9251417da4000020","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Tapie","original_name":"Bernard Tapie","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/b9XYqTfSBcRjHWhgpzIIDTqqujZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5335f1a09251417daa00001f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Lelouch","original_name":"Claude Lelouch","popularity":0.6529,"profile_path":"/yGkKejxPnsTtfHSR5HjYKW1XuE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54fc40e3c3a36816380010cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1436617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Laure Plante","original_name":"Anne-Laure Plante","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54fc40f192514123a0001dd1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1689412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz-Olivier Giesbert","original_name":"Franz-Olivier Giesbert","popularity":0.1117,"profile_path":"/hKvFvZkySBBa1zOzi0AmsgnqocZ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self -
