Director Jesse Acevedo risked his own freedom; using hidden camera methods, he brings viewers inside the brewing Cuban revolution. Those filmed are at risk, even now, of imprisonment but through the courage of those willing to speak out we see the new Cuba rising to the beat of Los Aldeanos. In a small town outside Havana two young brothers, are beaten and arrested in their own home and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for listening to rappers Los Aldeanos, banned by the government. We follow the intermingled stories of the Cruz brothers and the band they love. From the streets of Havana comes the sound of struggle and the voice of a new revolution - Los Aldeanos.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":"/q8dGYyXrfJ4HMSkOEi2UZTokMDL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viva Cuba Libre: Rap Is War","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesse Acevedo","original_name":"Jesse Acevedo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5332df119251410b540036de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tiffany Naiman","original_name":"Tiffany Naiman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf677180e0a26169fccfde0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2329611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Ohlmann","original_name":"Aaron Ohlmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf6772d0e0a2619d3d0bff1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ronnie Pontiac","original_name":"Ronnie Pontiac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf6774d9251416fe8b9ddf4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329613,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Scheinberg","original_name":"James Scheinberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf6775e0e0a263547ca72b4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tamra Spivey","original_name":"Tamra Spivey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf677710e0a26169fccfe3c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Travis Blackwell","original_name":"Travis Blackwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf677810e0a263547ca72e6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329616,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rob Schultz","original_name":"Rob Schultz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf677c50e0a26169fccfed7","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329617,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marc Swadel","original_name":"Marc Swadel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf677e40e0a260858ca8a9f","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gil Vaisman","original_name":"Gil Vaisman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf677f492514140e0b8ffb3","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2145847","wikidata_id":"Q27985073","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bjkqttObemHDSPaL30s3yhV0xhb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8dGYyXrfJ4HMSkOEi2UZTokMDL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Viva Cuba Libre | Trailer | Available now","key":"dbXQM2GBmYI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2016-02-25T17:54:12.000Z","id":"5cf678490e0a2643c6d07df1"}]}}}
