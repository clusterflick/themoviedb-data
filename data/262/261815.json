A member of the Bloods since the age of twelve—both in the film and in reality—the streets of Brooklyn are all Primo has ever known. While John questions whether or not to enter into this life, Primo must decide whether to leave it all behind as he vows to become a better husband and father. Set during those New York summer weeks where the stifling heat seems to encase everything, Five Star plunges into gang culture with searing intensity. Director Keith Miller observes the lives of these two men with a quiet yet pointed distance, carefully eschewing worn clichés through its unflinching focus. Distinctions between fiction and real life remain intentionally ambiguous, allowing the story of these two men to resonate beyond the streets, as they face the question of what it means to be a man.","popularity":0.2511,"poster_path":"/rb1PBJPuArUcLdgBZbTGdadkVld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Star","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James 'Primo' Grant","original_name":"James 'Primo' Grant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Primo","credit_id":"5343ceb9c3a36814ff004da4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Diaz","original_name":"John Diaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"John","credit_id":"5343cec8c3a3681517004ee4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Nobles Colon","original_name":"Wanda Nobles Colon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John's Mum","credit_id":"5343cee6c3a3683d030028d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmine Burgos","original_name":"Jasmine Burgos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jasmine","credit_id":"5343cef3c3a3681517004eeb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaiden Kaine","original_name":"Jaiden Kaine","popularity":0.2196,"profile_path":"/91GC8A6CwyAi2YQsXimLeJB627B.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"5343cf28c3a3681517004eef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisette Finevelvet","original_name":"Lisette Finevelvet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Titi Dee Dee","credit_id":"5343cf38c3a36814ff004dac","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Robinson","original_name":"Tamara Robinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Tamara","credit_id":"5343cf44c3a3681527004cff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1890471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bird","original_name":"Richard Bird","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gun Dealer","credit_id":"59bfcd44c3a3686cf80011bc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Miller","original_name":"Keith Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5335b41cc3a3682a9c005080","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Miller","original_name":"Keith Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5335b416c3a3682a9c00507e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1308011,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luisa Conlon","original_name":"Luisa Conlon","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/ewyY6wcNDeCzzUYP2cdyz9udIQz.jpg","credit_id":"5343ce5ec3a36814ff004d9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Miller","original_name":"Keith Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5343ce2bc3a368152f005009","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daryl Freimark","original_name":"Daryl Freimark","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5343ce3cc3a368151e004ced","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2361602","wikidata_id":"Q101113380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wCdKayjGr4tiW1Wmkr3jn9uxA2D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rb1PBJPuArUcLdgBZbTGdadkVld.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Five Star Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Drama Movie HD","key":"RS5BaSeyqVc","published_at":"2015-06-22T16:36:19.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"558853c09251416fad00053f"}]}}}
