Suddenly the photograph is \"released,\" electronically brought to life for one heightened, anecdotal moment — a single gesture, a punctuating sound — and then frozen again. Witty and often poignant, these revelatory documents of time, place and memory denote a fleeting, ephemeral reality. A 32-minute version also exists, featuring additional postcards.","popularity":0.1153,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Postcards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Postcards","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Cahen","original_name":"Robert Cahen","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/FmOZh0dH1DeEDbja7brcmZxQgO.jpg","credit_id":"533451ee9251414454001fdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Longuet","original_name":"Alain Longuet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f06b0592514158d0007876","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Huter","original_name":"Stéphane Huter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f06af89251415a0200796a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
