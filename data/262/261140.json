Well, wait a minute... It does feature one boob named Jacob who longs to keep his ex-wife close-by for masochistic pleasure. There's also C.B., a nervous romantic with a hapless crush on an exotic burping beauty named Lizzie, who only wants to find a man with a mind like a woman, fall in love, and fly away to Paris. It's an intoxicating blend of early sixties European romp and post-modern cynicism in glorious technicolor!","popularity":0.2517,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pray you're not it.","title":"Duck, Duck, Goose!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.
