The protagonist is a 19-year-old musical genius Joachim (modeled probably after F. Schubert or R. Schumann). A creator inhabiting the borderline between reality and madness. . . or perhaps genius? A man who steers his fate or perhaps merely follows the glamor and darkness of women (such as Clara Wieck, Schumann's wife; Mozart's Constance; or mysterious Rosamund) encountered along the way. Music of the great Romantics provides the backdrop for the story: Mozart's Quintet in A-major, Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata, and Schumann's eponymous Märchenbilder.","popularity":0.138,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contra Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agencja Produkcji Filmowej","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1998-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairy Tale Images","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"6502038c5545ca00e1b06400","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4214159,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ireneusz Janik","original_name":"Ireneusz Janik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65020344d7dcd20139cb92e2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zofia Kucharska-Kowalik","original_name":"Zofia Kucharska-Kowalik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650203c5d7dcd200c53765fe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3532192,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anna Niemira","original_name":"Anna Niemira","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502031ed7dcd20139cb92d0","department":"Directing","job":"Second Unit Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46872,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Schumann","original_name":"Robert Schumann","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/6mqSHpDkRfEjETSKlpfOmfrQ2Z.jpg","credit_id":"6502039e5545ca00e1b0640e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4270033,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ryszard Kaja","original_name":"Ryszard Kaja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6502036e1bf26600e25ea6eb","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Schubert","original_name":"Franz Schubert","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/mu0lM6bf1qO0DvFPBe8DgtCR46N.jpg","credit_id":"650203afe0ca7f014f71074b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2663099,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrzej J.
