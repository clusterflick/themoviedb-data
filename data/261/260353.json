His girlfriend has left to work in Qatar, allowing the young man to fully thrust himself into his work as a “companion” to elderly European women who spend their vacations at local resort hotels. Danish filmmaker Emil Langballe records in detail what appears to be a budding love affair between Juma and a middle-aged British woman. The documentary turns out to be a real-life version of Ulrich Seidl’s feature Paradise: Love, investigating local female sex tourism based on a false sense of romance.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beach Boy","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emil Langballe","original_name":"Emil Langballe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"532f91c3c3a3685fbb00528d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emil Langballe","original_name":"Emil Langballe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcfebcc3a36843480012e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emil Langballe","original_name":"Emil Langballe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcfec5c3a368433b0013db","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Finn McNicholas","original_name":"Finn McNicholas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcfee6c3a368432d0013f2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2783868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
