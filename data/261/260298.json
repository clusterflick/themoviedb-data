However, the filmmaker soon discovers their daily lives aren't especially interesting, and soon he finds himself deliberately throwing chaos into their path in hopes of making for a more exciting movie. Married Life: The Movie was originally produced as a weekly television series, with four episodes re-edited into this feature; the show's director and star, Ken Finkleman, later went on to create the award-winning Canadian sitcom The Newsroom.","popularity":0.5948,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Married Life: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Finkleman","original_name":"Ken Finkleman","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/crXQvJ2XM92IS9N54ZY0ML6FI1G.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"532c0cf99251416e92000d67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Hotz","original_name":"Jeremy Hotz","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/1GlagcYc7O408Vt2BHGWGMMRrY3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"532c0d0b9251416e9f000c41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1212664,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Farrell","original_name":"Mark Farrell","popularity":0.074,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"532c0d179251416e8f000be1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Hines","original_name":"Karen Hines","popularity":0.1345,"profile_path":"/lhyiFuMdCZAxRFTxgwjo2ZQojlp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"532c0d259251416e95000b8a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Finkleman","original_name":"Ken Finkleman","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/crXQvJ2XM92IS9N54ZY0ML6FI1G.jpg","credit_id":"532c0d3f9251416e8c000cf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Finkleman","original_name":"Ken Finkleman","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/crXQvJ2XM92IS9N54ZY0ML6FI1G.jpg","credit_id":"532c0d4e9251416e8f000be5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113777","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10061,"name":"dysfunctional marriage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Married Life Clip 2 - The wedding","key":"w_9ozzNR2DQ","published_at":"2009-08-10T18:08:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec72fc3a368544800bffc"}]}}}
