He gets conned by a bigoted board chairman, and has his label, 'Impossibly Funky Records' taken over. As surmised by Alllmovie, this tuneful drama features the rock group Love Machine as it tells the tale of a record promoter hired by a crooked producer to fulfill affirmative action quotas. It is the hard-working, independent-minded promoter who discovers and develops the Love Machine, an all female group. The trouble begins when the group's lead singer is kidnapped and the promoter learns that his employer's label is really a front for the mob.","popularity":0.3738,"poster_path":"/mmoSXDjYC27mZI0GU47dmZmyEDw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Getting Over","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Daniels","original_name":"John Daniels","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mike Barnett","credit_id":"5e9038a2fdc1460013473813","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel King","original_name":"Mabel King","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/ntJU1E8qARhjsDiLsa261IXdihN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mabel Queen","credit_id":"63facc44cf62cd0081512ecb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Edmonds","original_name":"Don Edmonds","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/zlZAlA4rUnHUfzZZwq629F42pC2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Leon Millstine","credit_id":"63facc9196e30b00dd706923","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":52622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
