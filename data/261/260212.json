It begins with two black circles against a white background, knocking together and gradually moving further apart. The circles fade out, and return as white circles against black inside a square. Images similar to Rorschach blots appear. Gradually the viewer realizes that the images were not originally abstract, but were human forms (dancers, gymnasts, etc.), bridges, and others that have been split down the center of the frame, with their mirror images printed on either side of the split. Red, green, and white tints further abstract the images from their original foundations in the natural world, making dancers appear to be amoebas or dividing cells. The accompanying sound track is a mixture of electronic music and musique concreÌ€te (\"real\" recorded sounds manipulated to sound abstract).","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":"/qAwk3vc3XbGzrOIrCWdE6j3MCMu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7362","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"7362.1967","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat O'Neill","original_name":"Pat O'Neill","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/AaS3vp38O3zxHWZhGbG4EO9pmRu.jpg","credit_id":"532b63a29251416e8f00007a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598138,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Byrd","original_name":"Joseph Byrd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fabaf1c3a3683dc500065c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2507263,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Moore","original_name":"Michael Moore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1a22ce23d27800129b1153","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0161213","wikidata_id":"Q65032380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qjib0xZl3iW96prEwb38mSdJAP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1344}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qAwk3vc3XbGzrOIrCWdE6j3MCMu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":775,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6SgFRQPLTxUt1KvRxQmgCpdYmp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":516},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3LGvqrpq8OfHlgLFt14N6O08Cjx.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
