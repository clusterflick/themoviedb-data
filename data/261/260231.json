This creature, naive but murderous, spends his days lurking in the woods and satisfying his lust for human flesh as an inspector from Frankfurt sets out to hunt him down. Olsen employs a visual cornucopia of moods, textures, and themes with miniatures, animation, water tank photography, and other techniques. With an international cast of non-actors speaking in German with English subtitles, this mostly black-and-white nod to German expressionism moves closer to the field of abstraction and transforms a simple narrative into a true sensory experience.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ich Hunger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makalele Gorsich","original_name":"Makalele Gorsich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Farm Girl","credit_id":"559fd817c3a3680d5d000024","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Harder","original_name":"Andreas Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Creature","credit_id":"559fd8279251414085000029","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andre Mazloom","original_name":"Andre Mazloom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Stephen Heckle","credit_id":"559fd835c3a3680d56000031","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shameem Moshrefzadeh","original_name":"Shameem Moshrefzadeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tourist","credit_id":"559fd844c3a3680d56000036","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Tillier","original_name":"Dani Tillier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"559fd84bc3a3680d5200002f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Olsen","original_name":"Isaac Olsen","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"532b722f9251416e9c00015e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andre Mazloom","original_name":"Andre Mazloom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559fd86dc3a3680d66000043","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3864104","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
