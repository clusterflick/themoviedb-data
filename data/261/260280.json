The main character in his new novel, Harumi, drops out of high school and leads a quiet life, unable to understand his brother. He is scared that the same blood runs in his veins but is also enraged by the fact that his brother’s life is consumed as material for novels by many writers. A novelist, Hasegawa faces limitations in making being able to make fiction as real and cruel as it is in reality. Hasegawa hears from a witness how a murder happened but he cannot be sure if it is a true event or from her imagination. One day, Hasegawa encounters Harumi… This is an obscure yet attractive film that extends its style from Kurosawa Kiyoshi to David Lynch. The title, A Bao A Qu, comes from a shapeless being that earns its shape as the pilgrim of a true heart near him featured in Indian religion and The Arabian Nights.","popularity":0.2611,"poster_path":"/u7mOIJ85ugmmUriCzIEL0qzoKdO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53391,"logo_path":"/7aPeLmQjH1EFhqAXWLyyxZ535QA.png","name":"Tokyo University of the Arts","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bao A Qu","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Nakaizumi","original_name":"中泉英雄","popularity":0.2529,"profile_path":"/xiZECCxGiGmaSE24moAmAUSfWDf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9d890ac3a3684296001302","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1862964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshiki Hirose","original_name":"広瀬斗史輝","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9d8919c3a368428200136d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":464228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aoba Kawai","original_name":"河井青葉","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/uwco35JnqlaFLM4nmy5BMsmI8i0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9d896f0e0a2671f5001498","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1831234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arata Takase","original_name":"Arata Takase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8sbydhPrvwpNYzeiE3by74YzhRk.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9d89900e0a267201001553","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junya Ishii","original_name":"Junya Ishii","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9d89b30e0a2671f2001538","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Azusa","original_name":"Azusa","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5a9d89c5925141102100148a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoki Katō","original_name":"加藤直輝","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"539822010e0a266db400c7bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoki Katō","original_name":"加藤直輝","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"539822270e0a266db700c6f0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476000,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keisuke Masuda","original_name":"Keisuke Masuda","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d8747925141102b00127b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1991189,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eijun Sugihara","original_name":"Eijun Sugihara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d876c0e0a26720500154a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991190,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Satoshi Kubota","original_name":"Satoshi Kubota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d87b5c3a3684282001261","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991191,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ikue Takeuchi","original_name":"Ikue Takeuchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d87db92514110210012f4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991192,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noriaki Minami","original_name":"Noriaki Minami","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d88010e0a2671fe00144c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1991193,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hiroshi Suzuki","original_name":"Hiroshi Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d882e9251411034001284","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694326,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yasuhiro Morinaga","original_name":"森永泰弘","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d88c3c3a3684287001558","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2111255","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7mOIJ85ugmmUriCzIEL0qzoKdO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
