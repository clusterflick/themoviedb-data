While Rodrigo may have attempted to put his past life behind him, the memory of his now deceased mother and his old-world family returns to haunt him. In an old city dominated by the weight of tradition, Rodrigo discovers a daughter about whose existence he had never known, as well as a grand-daughter, the enigmatic and beautiful Octavia. A rebellious teenager, Octavia dismisses her grandfather's old politics, possessing her own sense of what freedom means. Patino's film is a poetic, assured contemplation on the pain of returning somewhere you never really left and the accompanying ironies of a man obsessed with history who cannot face his own.","popularity":0.6497,"poster_path":"/7uWwX9RrxZ0oE38ydCpYaZAz9NA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8174,"logo_path":"/nhX2rE2Owfr1wnomZ3o4eEh4QdZ.png","name":"Lanterna Magica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Octavia","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Niebla de guerra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Ángel Solá","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Solá","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/jvkbzIBASI8H91kuN0z9bnLuQuB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rodrigo","credit_id":"532f1a9d9251413a7e0038c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarita Lozano","original_name":"Margarita Lozano","popularity":0.2271,"profile_path":"/xsSBfAnXd6fFgf2BJPL3fXu5lyI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Doña","credit_id":"532f1aa99251413a780039a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia San Juan","original_name":"Antonia San Juan","popularity":0.2262,"profile_path":"/A4rhAimrDiTfTVsXNqiJ2clVpx4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Manuela","credit_id":"532f1ab49251413a7b003a3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanca Oteyza","original_name":"Blanca Oteyza","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/yQob5wEq8Wt8RmQkCvOHCCCgVNi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elsa","credit_id":"532f1ac09251413a81003b9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Naschy","original_name":"Paul Naschy","popularity":0.472,"profile_path":"/13fj7Qg1Q7ndGm5NPA7ha8UffkU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Inspector","credit_id":"532f1acb9251413a81003b9e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Javier Rioyo","original_name":"Javier Rioyo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Journalist","credit_id":"532f1ad59251413a7e0038ce","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":97686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Menh-Wai Trinh","original_name":"Menh-Wai Trinh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Octavia","credit_id":"532f1ae29251413a85003a3b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Basilio Martín Patino","original_name":"Basilio Martín Patino","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/dnlZnbdFpAq60O2mpNhJehdHYYt.jpg","credit_id":"532f1a8c9251413a85003a2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Basilio Martín Patino","original_name":"Basilio Martín Patino","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/dnlZnbdFpAq60O2mpNhJehdHYYt.jpg","credit_id":"53efde7c0e0a2675ac001dd5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0338297","wikidata_id":"Q6048587","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uWwX9RrxZ0oE38ydCpYaZAz9NA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
