Every mark is a message in time, the invocation of an absence. To travel in the memory is to walk in time, zigzagging, a long road permeated by a dark, indecipherable logic… if we could choose seven moments to sum up our entire life, which ones would they be? The Dance of the Memory is a documentary-essay that guides us in that autobiographical search, where image and memory intertwine. It mixes archive material with an aesthetic and subjective tone.","popularity":0.2789,"poster_path":"/5fc34rCITaM5DuTIdZ4BH3qTEEJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If we could choose seven moments to sum up our entire life, which ones would they be?","title":"The Dance of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Memories dance","type":"festival"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304071,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriela D.
