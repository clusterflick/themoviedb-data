She was the supermodel who became Andy Warhol’s most notorious muse and the singer of legendary American rock band Velvet Underground. She had a troublesome love story with Jim Morrison and gave her son his first shot. She was a nomad, always on her way to Paris, London, or New York and stood in the center of the sixties’ art revolution.  In \"Nico – Sphinx of Ice\", we are taken on a journey through the psyche of the broken and unbreakable sixties’ icon.","popularity":0.1004,"poster_path":"/59IWpDgAcnJoGmXFyycMoZATJUE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kulturbryggan","origin_country":""},{"id":41352,"logo_path":"/nLJlcIh5W5mdJ86d5ClxuY4YZr7.png","name":"Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":84741,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blixten & Co","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"64","title":"Nico - Sphinx of Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Risberg","original_name":"Fanny Risberg","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":"/wk4UwtsNrRSz0TbiMYMRJOkNFdM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nico","credit_id":"5a436b60c3a36858c504e4f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":997651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grönberg Nils","original_name":"Grönberg Nils","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The child","credit_id":"5a436d480e0a264fb904ca3f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":396609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadja Weiss","original_name":"Nadja Weiss","popularity":0.3103,"profile_path":"/lSChncsWtrPF3IhVePT7xxlJnHy.jpg","credit_id":"5a436b860e0a264f2904aaf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Fritsch","original_name":"Werner Fritsch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ohbnH9K9mTqbNiqTJt93tAGNo59.jpg","credit_id":"5a436b990e0a264f8504d132","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948776,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Boix-Vives","original_name":"Philippe Boix-Vives","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a436bafc3a36858e4049bcc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712943,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emil Klang","original_name":"Emil Klang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a436bc09251411fab064d24","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455995,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mikael Varhelyi","original_name":"Mikael Varhelyi","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a436bda925141361f012a81","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico","original_name":"Nico","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/6VyjDb5du0kN0XshCn0l1nO4uRF.jpg","credit_id":"5a436cf60e0a264fb904c9f8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948780,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Magnus Lindman","original_name":"Magnus Lindman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a436d209251411f4f060ca7","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/59IWpDgAcnJoGmXFyycMoZATJUE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
