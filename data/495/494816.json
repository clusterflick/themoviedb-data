They go from one extreme to the other (from dream to reality, from day to night, from black and white to color), and so travel symbolically through this timelessness. Kristin disappears and Doreen is lost is the big city. Her meetings with Marcel, a filmmaker, then David, a sculptor, accomplish nothing, and she is destroyed by daylight. But her Memory of Gene Tierney triumphs over night and death, and Cinema can continue.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":"/8QDuAgoT9esq4pWCTgyyi8aCk30.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98789,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.O.C.K.
