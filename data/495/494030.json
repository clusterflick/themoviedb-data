Physically and socially they are total opposites. Maggie is a gifted high school runner from a dysfunctional family and Max is a shy boy with a clubfoot who hails from one of the town's most respected families. In spite of their differences and perhaps because of them, the two outcasts grow to become best friends, and all through school they help each other over the rough spots and lend a shoulder to cry on when needed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":209123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omantra Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake of Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raj Thiruselvan","original_name":"Raj Thiruselvan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3c491c925141032c235086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3429692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
