The camera documents a group of 20 people gathered in a hall to perform. The cast includes real-life performers whose skills range from the mundane to the extraordinary: a hula hooper, a singer, a pizza dough thrower, speed skippers, tap dancers, gymnasts and dog trainers. Two men make salami, a woman gets a haircut and someone eats too many hotdogs. Hrabluikâ€™s editing creates an exquisite corpse, connecting the performers as their bodies tap out a spellbinding rhythm.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Splits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1948013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Hrabluik","original_name":"Allison Hrabluik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a417739c3a368591602c1d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Arts Festival","release_date":"2017-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
