There, a group of springbreakers; a hotel with dolphins in its pool; a member of the Bloods dancing atop a Mayan archaeological site called El Rey; the demolition of a mirrored building; and the interior of the night club Cocobongo appear one after the other, set to a particular looped recording: Le feu de St. Elme, by Haïm Saban and Shuki Levy. This music is part of the soundtrack to an animated series about Spanish conquistadors, Mysterious Cities of Gold (1982).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fTSjiqMmMdlIJg56bSZwkNLfk7C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laura Bartlett Gallery","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cities of Gold and Mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyprien Gaillard","original_name":"Cyprien Gaillard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60855708904f6d002a10fcda","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyprien Gaillard","original_name":"Cyprien Gaillard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a413cdf9251411fab03be70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTSjiqMmMdlIJg56bSZwkNLfk7C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
