Director Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, together with long-time friend and activist Aaju Peter, is determined to uncover the mystery and meaning behind this beautiful ancient tradition. Together they embark on an adventure through Arctic communities, speaking with elders and recording the stories of a once popularized female artform. Central to the film is Arnaquq-Baril’s personal debate over whether or not to get tattood herself. With candour and humour, she welcomes us into her world, to experience firsthand the complex emotions that accompany her struggle. Past meets present in this intimate account of one woman’s journey towards self-empowerment and cultural understanding.","popularity":0.6882,"poster_path":"/cAVAEFlLEyq8MZFt5nZZxCfIXcf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unikkaat Studios Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tunniit: Retracing the Lines of Inuit Tattoos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alethea Arnaquq-Baril","original_name":"Alethea Arnaquq-Baril","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/2qnfxx6JN0XEymM6sqLKicUs6on.jpg","credit_id":"5a418e5cc3a36858e402b091","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alethea Arnaquq-Baril","original_name":"Alethea Arnaquq-Baril","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/2qnfxx6JN0XEymM6sqLKicUs6on.jpg","credit_id":"5a418f1b0e0a264f2902b9b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Dewolff","original_name":"Charlotte Dewolff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a418f2bc3a368589002a40c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1948049,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Houston","original_name":"John Houston","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a418f59c3a368591602ddd4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q91407527","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lXfxWNBbBXWBJjO5yz95JYdxPA3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cAVAEFlLEyq8MZFt5nZZxCfIXcf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yjEz8AVU1hMg0x0SoDHt2cGSbQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"},{"id":163203,"name":"tattooing"},{"id":215162,"name":"indigenous peoples"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tunniit - Trailer","key":"271284667","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-24T17:55:05.000Z","id":"648766e7e375c000c5291080"}]}}}
