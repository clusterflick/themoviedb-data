After prom, the fourth-graders escape to a private party, then return to school together for a farewell spree, during which a fire breaks out in the classroom. Due to the style of school investigation, students whose human and personal rights have been repeatedly violated leave the school building without permission during class. They are organized with a huge ambition to change the world together. While graduation only affects them emotionally, the baccalaureate exam turns them into individuals who recognize their individual interests.","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/vP5ZyNouIW6LbUJWq0TJ1A2CqDL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1981-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Graduation","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katalin Takács","original_name":"Katalin Takács","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/wGBvHxKTkKUjPjdC2N9z5ZeOUB7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jutka néni","credit_id":"5c7552930e0a260b581a5639","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hajdú Ágnes","original_name":"Hajdú Ágnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gabi","credit_id":"5c7552c20e0a260b5d1a3b66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mentes József","original_name":"Mentes József","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Igazgató","credit_id":"5c7552e40e0a260b4c1a4cd0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1892555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László Csendes","original_name":"László Csendes","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Igazgatóhelyettes","credit_id":"5c75530ec3a3684846d36085","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Szulák","original_name":"Andrea Szulák","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vali","credit_id":"5c755325c3a3684818d31660","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2251247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"máriássy Ferenc","original_name":"máriássy Ferenc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c75539792514168895414c4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamás Almási","original_name":"Tamás Almási","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/izAqsAdPxXbFG2SQBchHsiFlWva.jpg","credit_id":"5c755359925141688c540bfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0080411","wikidata_id":"Q789460","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":920,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/vP5ZyNouIW6LbUJWq0TJ1A2CqDL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
