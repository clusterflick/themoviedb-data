He is a nuisance, but only for those who have had enough of his play acting or who are ashamed to be around this clown. His wife breaks up with him because she just can't tolerate the man any more and he seems to accept that in an apparently matter-of-fact way. He leaves the city for a cottage in the countryside.","popularity":0.066,"poster_path":"/6P0yyRFb3K9Xp9JD9LfzlMwC18d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuisance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlies Heuer","original_name":"Marlies Heuer","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/4L1HVraZQCHDpAKWV8eN9Xfj4JW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6042a57950733c0030e3ea0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Schuurman","original_name":"Betty Schuurman","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/7lCNa93WbOxvTpuSzl9O2x29VHA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6042a5861a934f00597831ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René van 't Hof","original_name":"René van 't Hof","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/lJRseOkh4sQW7IGE4YpZCDWFP7c.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6042a5931a934f006ef86c07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2999921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nienke van Spreeuwel","original_name":"Nienke van Spreeuwel","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6042a5a00102c90044eb5962","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans van de Staak","original_name":"Frans van de Staak","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/3QON6KnDCObYAM24a0QkLhm1LFq.jpg","credit_id":"5a41aec7c3a368586c02df39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Hausdörfer","original_name":"Hans Hausdörfer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6042a4d18813e40059dd9425","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2999920,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stan Lutz","original_name":"Stan Lutz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6042a4e2d185720077937dd2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans van de Staak","original_name":"Frans van de Staak","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/3QON6KnDCObYAM24a0QkLhm1LFq.jpg","credit_id":"6042a4f41a934f006ef86b2b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans van de Staak","original_name":"Frans van de Staak","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/3QON6KnDCObYAM24a0QkLhm1LFq.jpg","credit_id":"6042a50d50733c0045e52ad6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117236,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marten Negenman","original_name":"Marten Negenman","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6042a51d1108a80043601b4a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707873,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Wich","original_name":"Jan Wich","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6042a53018b751005ac65255","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanneke Stark","original_name":"Hanneke Stark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6042a541a35c8e004577b325","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans van de Staak","original_name":"Frans van de Staak","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/3QON6KnDCObYAM24a0QkLhm1LFq.jpg","credit_id":"6042a5516cf3d5007059a466","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2999920,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stan Lutz","original_name":"Stan Lutz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6042a56299c964006ef85b10","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1121953","wikidata_id":"Q4369670","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQ9ecbnz9CUB7TUQl6UAUZmnEsL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6P0yyRFb3K9Xp9JD9LfzlMwC18d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
