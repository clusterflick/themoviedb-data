Claudio Abbado had formed this ensemble from famous instrumentalists, celebrated chamber-musicians and experienced soloists from the world’s best orchestras, and the event was sold out months in advance. The ‘Neue Zürcher Zeitung’ reported: “Once again the applause at the end was unequalled; the immense final chord … broke a tension that had lasted over 90 minutes without relaxing for a moment.”","popularity":0.5276,"poster_path":"/ciNLt0izM8JEFmxNZI6hV2LFGLz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Conducted by Claudio Abbado.","title":"Mahler: Symphony No. 2 “Resurrection” – Lucerne Festival","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Abbado","original_name":"Claudio Abbado","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/v6zf1YHJ3gMAvQ5xmrTYkd4A12.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self – Conductor","credit_id":"5a405678c3a368588e0143ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eteri Gvazava","original_name":"Eteri Gvazava","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65594dd127db61010003989c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Larsson","original_name":"Anna Larsson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/n9dfUFXy8ueImIFwEzRH1WozWlc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65594de1d4fe0400ac38013d","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ciNLt0izM8JEFmxNZI6hV2LFGLz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0Chalg5FAKeXYq0iPyNa7rtGtR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1412,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f85el9sfe5kiRytRzGdqxxBkkXH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Q3xVGnT7uLVScOcbj0HG2AT7H5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":166927,"name":"symphony"},{"id":210633,"name":"mahler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gustav Mahler: Symphony No.2","key":"W9kLG7KmteY","published_at":"2011-05-16T13:35:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a40d0d9c3a368589001bc95"}]}}}
