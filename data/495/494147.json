Shot in Jan./Feb. 2014 in the Saharawi Liberated Territories of Western Sahara, and in the Saharawi Refugee Camps in Tindouf, Algeria, the film shows the saga of the Sahrawis, their struggle to regain their homeland and the sad paradox of a nomadic people forced to live in confinement. During production, the crew made a rare treck through 3,000 kilometers of bleak and dangerous desert, becoming unwitting participants in the conflict when their jeep was blown up by an anti-tank mine less than a kilometer from their destination on Western Sahara's Atlantic coast.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/rmQPE7Y2FNC44sVeaAqwGHQMSRn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Desert of the Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tito Gonzalez Garcia","original_name":"Tito Gonzalez Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3d9cacc3a3680bac00415b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1946738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Abujamra","original_name":"Samir Abujamra","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3d9cb20e0a2620dd004354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5716094","wikidata_id":"Q27051825","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rmQPE7Y2FNC44sVeaAqwGHQMSRn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
