Prokofiev's popular and vibrant Third Piano Concerto demonstrates the composer's sharp musical wit, and Yuja Wang is a brilliant exponent of the work. Following this, and chiming beautifully with the festival's theme of the relationship between art and nature, Mahler's First Symphony is given an illuminating and rapturously received performance.","popularity":0.473,"poster_path":"/zP4iRvQtYO3bpXzckQJg8WkILHl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Conducted by Claudio Abbado","title":"Lucerne Festival: Mahler: Symphony No. 1; Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No.3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Abbado","original_name":"Claudio Abbado","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/v6zf1YHJ3gMAvQ5xmrTYkd4A12.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5a404d529251411fd502b7de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2625578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuja Wang","original_name":"Yuja Wang","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"piano","credit_id":"641395b1e18e3f08403cd812","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustav Mahler","original_name":"Gustav Mahler","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/21kYlDN9JDw4cKw3Bs3pZyu81t0.jpg","credit_id":"6413960b99259c00b845cc07","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965759,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrej Nicolay","original_name":"Andrej Nicolay","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64139706ede1b0285b66d97b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58024,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sergei Prokofiev","original_name":"Сергей Прокофьев","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":"/uTA6DTaQUJbOKNtCLVhQF1hDMKW.jpg","credit_id":"6413954ca6c10400d8d8ead5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Beyer","original_name":"Michael Beyer","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/8gMfqEcOc70CZERoSq5nGcNSzLo.jpg","credit_id":"64139753532acb0079bfc356","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079037,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steffen Herrmann","original_name":"Steffen Herrmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64139724b42242418958d57d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zP4iRvQtYO3bpXzckQJg8WkILHl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Q3xVGnT7uLVScOcbj0HG2AT7H5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":3537,"name":"orchestra"},{"id":166927,"name":"symphony"},{"id":210633,"name":"mahler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Abbado Conducts Mahler No. 1 &  Prokofiev","key":"GBVfEZjARwc","published_at":"2011-05-10T09:48:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a404e81c3a36858c501662c"}]}}}
