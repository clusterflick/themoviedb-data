Although the protagonist shares some features with the experimental physicist and writer George Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799), who wrote the famous Sudelbücher and numerous letters, the film does not pretend any historical accuracy with respect to the real Lichtenberg, but focuses on Offermans' hybrid [partial fictitious] personage. The result is not an interplay between fact and fiction, but a sort of view of Lichtenberg, mouthing some 19th- and 20th- century authors he couldn't have known, strictly speaking, but whose alleged fantastic formulations seem to follow from his own writings in a natural way.","popularity":0.3468,"poster_path":"/kUFKzfUl5GGajYw6RO4dUN1XCtv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wastebook scenes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiel Nooter","original_name":"Michiel Nooter","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/vYisyZbQQ0pk80DzU8pJmv01MHf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a41b182c3a3685844030c21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlies Heuer","original_name":"Marlies Heuer","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/4L1HVraZQCHDpAKWV8eN9Xfj4JW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a41b19b0e0a264fb902f521","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rik van Uffelen","original_name":"Rik van Uffelen","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60357d2f97eab4003ed2ce13","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans van de Staak","original_name":"Frans van de Staak","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/3QON6KnDCObYAM24a0QkLhm1LFq.jpg","credit_id":"5a41b1dd9251411f510447c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707873,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Wich","original_name":"Jan Wich","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60357d89a14e10003ed00b15","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kUFKzfUl5GGajYw6RO4dUN1XCtv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
