During the last year of the Bloomberg Administration, NYC’s government advanced plans for a “dynamic” high-end entertainment district that would completely wipe out this historic industrial core. The year is 2013, and the workers of Willets Point are racing against the clock to forestall their impending eviction.  Their story launches an investigation into New York City’s history as the front line of deindustrialization, urban renewal, and gentrification.","popularity":0.6531,"poster_path":"/fVa0dVOxmxu470N7AjJ3OYY6kfM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Iron Triangle: Willets Point and the Remaking of New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prudence Katze","original_name":"Prudence Katze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a430eefc3a36858900434d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Lehman","original_name":"William Lehman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a430effc3a368588e040e07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6337282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fVa0dVOxmxu470N7AjJ3OYY6kfM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":5340,"name":"investigation"},{"id":6134,"name":"automobile industry"},{"id":235231,"name":"urban planning"},{"id":258955,"name":"latin american immigration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
