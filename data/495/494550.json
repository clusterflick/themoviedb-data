Excerpts from Hitler’s letters from the front, recollections of regimental comrades, and evaluations by his officers offer a revealing portrait of a brooding, fearless loner who preferred battlefields to brothels, frontline service to home leave, and kept the men he frequently risked his life to protect at arm’s length.  In a world of death, hardship, and discipline, Hitler sought comfort in the companionship of his English terrier, and in sketches and watercolors he rendered during lulls.  It speculates on the influence wartime service exercised on his personal and political development, filling a critical gap for any sincere appraisal of Hitler’s psyche, motives, and subsequent actions.","popularity":0.3968,"poster_path":"/q7HkJWXU2480z340fs3sXohoBVn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movienewmedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler: The Unknown Soldier 1914-1918","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Adolf Hitler - Frontsoldat im 1.
