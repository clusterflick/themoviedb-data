In just over an hour, condensing almost a year of filming in Paris, we get the impression of a single day of sunshine, a continuous kaleidoscope in the most diverse city in the world. The novelty is the attention to detail, which earned us, right in the middle of a series of sweeps, capsizes, Mathieu-style calligraphy, veritable little Gnoli-style paintings: a woman's shoe, a sweater button, or still lifes, in the cubist way, graphic elements: such and such of the thousand and prescriptions that populate the streets. This film thus takes its place at the forefront of all thosewho celebrate the capital today. Weaving together so many \"energies\", making the disparate elements communicate, it is the most complete, the most beautiful of Michel Nedjar's filmic works.\" - Dominique Nogues.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/qh8vMOHoRNHWPLW4HxZVvq8fN5Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capitale-paysage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1882414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Nedjar","original_name":"Michel Nedjar","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/1zQhNh1fsubzEwomJaSV7ep2Cld.jpg","credit_id":"5a44d6f39251411f51079b1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6932198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.65,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qh8vMOHoRNHWPLW4HxZVvq8fN5Y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":650},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OYem4gZl4XIcXnof9mEgUuFqPn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/orjMNGmpYW7sERNRldNFIPsK32G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Scratch projection","release_date":"1983-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
