Raleigh, a recently discharged flyboy who dreams of becoming a writer, and May, a young woman set on becoming a missionary, meet and discover that they grew up mere miles from each other in Kentucky. The possibility of romance emerges and the two imagine going to the Nibroc Festival together in May’s hometown. But they are thwarted by their own natures and circumstances. An intimate and charming exploration of human relationships.  The first part of Arlene Hutton’s Nibroc Trilogy was captured by Cinevative at the Rubicon Theatre Company in California.","popularity":0.1981,"poster_path":"/3mBfCqZrT8dAo8Ds5c0qjXuB8pO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rubicon Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Train to Nibroc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":166896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Gibson","original_name":"Lily Gibson","popularity":0.5899,"profile_path":"/pW9YDLAKPs3xUlo8KvU5kUZ4QlK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"May","credit_id":"5f534d65d705940031cb9555","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Odom","original_name":"Erik Odom","popularity":0.1544,"profile_path":"/wdGfX7Fu3H9g6DIm4uMs6fN4NmU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Raleigh","credit_id":"5f534d74d705940032ccd16d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharine Farmer","original_name":"Katharine Farmer","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f534d56b3316b0032ec7304","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arlene Hutton","original_name":"Arlene Hutton","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f534d40904f6d003538f5e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VfGBAEAMyI7ufzNvsW3CFonkRY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZeA2Y2xumze4NPFrbE4NcqDYa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3mBfCqZrT8dAo8Ds5c0qjXuB8pO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
