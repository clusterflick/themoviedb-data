The children's game utilized in this project is called \"Make Electricity on Hands\", which is frequently played among children in South Korea. This project converts the game’s underlying conception and arisen sensation into a form of massage therapy. During each participation, participants will be asked to transfer the warmth to each other and to remain bonded at least during this massage session.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ofii7sOK5fcnCySHpdLxQqvCV7j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Proposition 1: Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivetta Sunyoung Kang","original_name":"Ivetta Sunyoung Kang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f535e9ab3316b0034ed7118","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric You","original_name":"Eric You","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f535ea7904f6d0035395777","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivetta Sunyoung Kang","original_name":"Ivetta Sunyoung Kang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f535e2f43999b0036e44e30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ofii7sOK5fcnCySHpdLxQqvCV7j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trocadero Art Space: Across the Haze","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Xpace Cultural Centre","release_date":"2020-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arlington Art Center: By Proxy","release_date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jip Gallery X Olympia: A place to visit","release_date":"2020-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
