The company policy provides as a guideline to prevent the approval as far as possible. When the widow of a victim, who committed suicide after being rejected, storms the office to loudly accuse these machinations, Franziska begins to doubt the correctness of her work and to rethink. She quits and works as a freelance lawyer to help injured parties legally to get their rights. First she deals with the case of a family in the neighborhood. The father has been in a wheelchair since an accident. However, the Strelaus have not yet seen any money from the insurance company. Initially not taken seriously by colleagues, the shy woman takes on the fight against the health insurance system and has to fight against resistance and above all with her own self-doubt.","popularity":1.1644,"poster_path":"/oqHlBQJSLbhgUz51P7aCBqdoz4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35389,"logo_path":"/nX4hlwsvFV7IhhpKKj0yf3PgkG7.png","name":"Zeitsprung
