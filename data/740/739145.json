One out of many days to come? Quite possibly the very last.  A long farewell, an ultimate goodbye to a life we have grown to hold dear. Leading to a head-on dive into a new reality, into a new state of being. To long for the unknown. To desire to be at the mercy of chance. Last caresses in solidarity, last minutes in shelter. End means beginning. Death becomes birth. From water, back into water. From gas to solid. Everything is commenced by woman, everything ends with a woman.","popularity":0.0684,"poster_path":"/znsm5G4Agun3FoIhE4q4dfxaFCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ostblok","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Italy & (This is) Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Plaschg","original_name":"Anja Plaschg","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/3iSnU8v3U44pP36naUYDP3BrFCW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"60c393858c3159003f28b930","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Talisa Lilly Lemke","original_name":"Talisa Lilly Lemke","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/pYoDAgecAOtzzVNqs8CE8T4QFqf.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"60c3939da76ac5006d9c78db","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Plaschg","original_name":"Anja Plaschg","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/3iSnU8v3U44pP36naUYDP3BrFCW.jpg","credit_id":"60c393325cc11d0040188303","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ioan Gavriel","original_name":"Ioan Gavriel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c39365992fe60029dc2e74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300897,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Bidron","original_name":"Adrian Bidron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c392ffd04d1a00795bdecb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121692,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lenz Mosbacher","original_name":"Lenz Mosbacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c39347aaf89700584969b2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ioan Gavriel","original_name":"Ioan Gavriel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c393235cc11d006e62e0f9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Plaschg","original_name":"Anja Plaschg","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/3iSnU8v3U44pP36naUYDP3BrFCW.jpg","credit_id":"60c39370aaf89700584969ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ioan Gavriel","original_name":"Ioan Gavriel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c3930ce24e3a0058a6af6e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ioan Gavriel","original_name":"Ioan Gavriel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5070a5498ef90035a2636b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1325205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Plaschg","original_name":"Anja Plaschg","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/3iSnU8v3U44pP36naUYDP3BrFCW.jpg","credit_id":"5f5070af7390c00031324ae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11524694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84y6KKFLEpj6LJXauMuGnFNrX6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znsm5G4Agun3FoIhE4q4dfxaFCG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
