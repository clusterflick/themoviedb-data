The film chronicles the journey of women who are pursuing their passions and crafting their careers in a male-dominated industry. From the up-and-coming independent curator to the global powerhouse, these creatives have crafted a brand for themselves as industry leaders, without compromising who they are. They are paving the way for a generation of women and LGBTQ people, previously excluded from the social and cultural norms of the hip-hop world. It is the weirdos and nonconformists who are now redefining what it means to be a woman of colour in hip-hop. \"Badassery\" examines the social, political and cultural factors that enabled and empowered their success, such as the growing economization of social media, the rise of independent artists, and beauty as capital.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/93CsEkmDMLkOiGnjW3flZguY9vN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Badassery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarafina McIntosh","original_name":"Sarafina McIntosh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f52fabac740d90035922feb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sunita Miya-Muganza","original_name":"Sunita Miya-Muganza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f52fadc156cc700376e971f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Demi Valentine","original_name":"Demi Valentine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f52facce894a6003853badb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93CsEkmDMLkOiGnjW3flZguY9vN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
