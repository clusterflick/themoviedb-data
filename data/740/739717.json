Dawid, a frustrated cop faces up to the demons from a traumatic childhood. Samiah, a young nurse clings to a disintegrating bubble of fantasy that shields her from facing life on lifeâ€™s terms. Aphiwe, an up-and-coming art director in a crumbling relationship, is confronted by his fear of connection as he looks for salvation beyond his impenetrable personal boundaries. In a city wracked by conflict, contradiction and harsh battles for survival, the four main characters each discover surprising and profound truths about their purposes as human beings through their inextricable connections to others. Fear meets hope. Anger meets love. Loss meets meaning. One night, one city, four lives changed forever and bound together by the unblinking gaze of an innocent child.","popularity":0.1796,"poster_path":"/dlRRBwvnnL9Rty6VeFkGsmSqflp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2020-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2764830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarryn Wyngaard","original_name":"Tarryn Wyngaard","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/mu6mMvF6sq3FjIRP08w4GlzKwuc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f527e1fb234b9003617819d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gideon Lombard","original_name":"Gideon Lombard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f527e29d705940032c921f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1353810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge Beckmann","original_name":"Inge Beckmann","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/mPlgYB2cDWp0GR8iuAzNktI1DGt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f527e32156cc700396cf486","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1478709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Aucamp","original_name":"Armand Aucamp","popularity":0.2491,"profile_path":"/6scoxV13sTnnXFLqVNiHnJU53Yh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f527e3d498ef90037a9e264","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niza Jay Ncoyini","original_name":"Niza Jay Ncoyini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f527e45e894a600374d5362","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louw Venter","original_name":"Louw Venter","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f527e63498ef9167ca3ac13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13153856","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":845,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dlRRBwvnnL9Rty6VeFkGsmSqflp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Afrikaans\", \"english_name\"=>\"Afrikaans\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"af\", \"native_name\"=>\"Afrikaans\"}","note":"Silwerskermfees","release_date":"2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"STAM (The Tree) Official Trailer","key":"452506267","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-28T09:32:07.000Z","id":"5f527ecf156cc700386d033a"}]}}}
