The only people in the Pacific to make elaborate turtleshell masks have none left - they are all in foreign museums. In a quest to reclaim the past, Ephraim Bani, a wise and knowledgeable Torres Strait Islander, travels with his wife to the great museums of Europe where his heritage lies. The film, an SBS Independent production, shows that the thickest of masks cracks when a descendant of the original owners enters a museum.","popularity":0.442,"poster_path":"/tzIPqYOXi8zKov58ZcQFsDDjzAr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2818,"logo_path":null,"name":"SBS
