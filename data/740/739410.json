Encuentro tells the story of the coming together of two worlds, that according to social dictates should never truly interact, and explores what happens as a result of that interaction. Encuentro is the collision of real and surreal, black and white, masculine and feminine, native and foreign, and examines the dynamic between 'in' and 'out', accepted and marginalized, as it contemplates the power, the fragility, and the desires that each possess.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encuentro","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Serebuoh","original_name":"Greg Serebuoh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8c69f81fb94f0036374ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2065922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
