By September, the separatists had won a resounding victory, routing the retreating Ukrainian army. Even as the battle was ongoing, however, allegations swirled that regular units of the Russian army had joined the battle on the side of the separatists, tipping the balance decisively in their favour. Russia denied the charges. But, in what became a watershed moment for open source investigation, communities of researchers, reporters, and citizen journalists gathered substantial and compelling open source evidence for the presence of the Russian military in the region.  This video is a documentary piece that ventures both into the realms of science and politics (itâ€™s part of the body of evidence submitted to the European Court of Human Rights in the form of an interactive platform).","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":"/wBBzpYswDmjqEeNZmsJyUWrmLDc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of Ilovaisk: Verifying Russian Military Presence in Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa985305346610041eb37f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1619,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wBBzpYswDmjqEeNZmsJyUWrmLDc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":"kg","file_path":"/1gBIoqZOZUqsWG36MEbbYglBNGZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":756}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
