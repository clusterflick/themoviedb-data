Exploring the drama of absurdity, greed, and human suffering—all for the brown gold of bird excrement—the film revisits three important episodes in the islands’ infamous history: the nineteenth-century imperial wars between Spain and its former colonies Peru and Chile; the horrific fate of the indentured Chinese laborers; and the US Guano Act of 1856 that authorized over one hundred claims for uninhabited islands, reefs, and atolls in the Pacific and Atlantic.","popularity":0.0804,"poster_path":"/3uv9sU2iScM2xE3tqnQhKQp1hZz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2016-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2849077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dinh Q.
