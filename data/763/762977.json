This phenomenon impacts kids from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Children's lives are consumed with wall-to-wall activities and constant monitoring-the overprotected, over-directed, over-pressured childhood is the new normal. This film takes us to schools in affluent Wilton, CT; working class Patchogue, NY; and metropolitan Manhattan. Throughout these different stories, a central question emerges: How can we eschew harmful parenting strategies and empower our kids to become their most fully realized, authentic selves? The film offers possible solutions as journalist Lenore Skenazy, evolutionary psychologist Peter Gray, former dean of freshmen at Stanford University Julie Lythcott-Haims, and leaders of the \"free play\" movement fight to restore a less curated childhood.","popularity":0.1445,"poster_path":"/c9rENaNZ98O695shU1irOaoRAK9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157525,"logo_path":null,"name":"MML Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All work and no play is no way for kids to grow up.","title":"Chasing Childhood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3162627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gray","original_name":"Peter Gray","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60f44d6133a533005f7445c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3162628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenore Skenazy","original_name":"Lenore Skenazy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60f44d6ae72fe8005e36ed7d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Schein","original_name":"Justin Schein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44cf3da9ef20046924af9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":60104,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eden Wurmfeld","original_name":"Eden Wurmfeld","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44cba7b7b4d0045580865","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret Munzer Loeb","original_name":"Margaret Munzer Loeb","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44caf62fcd3007e3f4b68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3162625,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Eisenpresser","original_name":"Lisa Eisenpresser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44cc7da9ef20046924acc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1112567,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Cieri","original_name":"David Cieri","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44ceae72fe80046d62149","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":60104,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eden Wurmfeld","original_name":"Eden Wurmfeld","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44cd2f1759c005f2f3797","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret Munzer Loeb","original_name":"Margaret Munzer Loeb","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44cdf635e7800468257fb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997285,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mary Ann Toman","original_name":"Mary Ann Toman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f44d00b865eb0075f51d73","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11819686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"ChasingChildhoodMovie","instagram_id":"chasingchildhoodmovie","twitter_id":"ChildhoodMovie"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9rENaNZ98O695shU1irOaoRAK9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cleveland International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Distributed by Abramorama","release_date":"2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CHASING CHILDHOOD | Official Trailer (2021)","key":"qrpC73hWwgQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-05-21T20:17:41.000Z","id":"60f44db433a533005f744621"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chasing Childhood Trailer","key":"438407089","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-15T02:28:27.000Z","id":"6078aed8f6787a00403bb61c"}]}}}
