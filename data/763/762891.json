Addiction to communication and loneliness, sex and abstinence, food and sports, drugs and religion. But sometimes we are afraid to admit to ourselves and others in our phobias, fears and complexes. It is necessary to confess, because this is the only way to get rid of addiction. This strange year bared our fears, made us more vulnerable, we had a lot of time for ourselves, we became more honest. Let's try to talk about why and what we depend on. And how can we help each other become stronger and cope with everything. Addiction is not licentiousness, not permissiveness, but a disease of loneliness, which is almost impossible to overcome alone with yourself.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139916,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Rain Channel","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Addiction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Zavisimost","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2851460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Amelyushkin","original_name":"Alexey Amelyushkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faae5862f3b17003df155cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2851461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Forshtreter","original_name":"Anna Forshtreter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faae5d2d6d64d0040783db3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2851462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Renat Davletgildeev","original_name":"Renat Davletgildeev","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faae5fd1d019100427bfc6f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
