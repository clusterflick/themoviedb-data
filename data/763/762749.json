The story is certainly different than anything you likely have heard or seen before, but just as well - paints a very complex and yet simple picture of our history, which explains all of the worldâ€™s religions, and the state of the world today.  All of the struggles that humanity is experiencing, and even why we are struggling to begin with, is explained through this story.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rHpDovumpCj8T2SD8OSFP5GCZbo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit Science 12 ~ The Human History Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rHpDovumpCj8T2SD8OSFP5GCZbo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
