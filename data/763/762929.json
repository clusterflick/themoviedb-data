Pushkin and the opera by P.I. Tchaikovsky, created in a unique author's technique - frame-by-frame processing of game blanks on glass using light-painting glaze. Barry, a famous director-animator, has been in love with the world of Pushkin since childhood and dreams of making a film based on the novel \"Eugene Onegin\". Illness has set priorities, and the director, together with his beloved cat, flies to Russia. Here, in the magical hotel \"Onegin\", everything is ready for immersion in the world of Pushkin. The film is dedicated to the director-puppeteer Barry Purvis.","popularity":0.0819,"poster_path":"/ovuAicmw98PtsSXr1VYHXkEnUYY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio MIR","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"«Onegin» Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Otel Onegin","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2004063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyubov Kazarnovskaya","original_name":"Любовь Казарновская","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/kTfliZI6GsGv3tP272sQXs187FU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hotel Owner (voice)","credit_id":"5faaf7a053866e00401671c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artur Vakha","original_name":"Артур Ваха","popularity":0.272,"profile_path":"/lsCQzI1Ecb3nCrB030wC5Hy3u6F.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"674cf0ab13a7f2dd35804bb4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Byzgu","original_name":"Сергей Бызгу","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/i4rcf0YIGoGjsuGemEsVd0yRMeh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"674cf0df465c6ba6dd93b89c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2297312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasiya Filippova","original_name":"Anastasiya Filippova","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/pA178ULSj6PwlcVMMBjqF0e1mxA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"674cf147ebb92e4a7e0474cb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1707284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irina Margolina","original_name":"Ирина Марголина","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/yirAAXImyXpf6To41Kqg0yCw6tX.jpg","credit_id":"5faaf460a6d931003ea3fa38","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1707284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irina Margolina","original_name":"Ирина Марголина","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/yirAAXImyXpf6To41Kqg0yCw6tX.jpg","credit_id":"5faaf467a84a47004039dfe4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Evteeva","original_name":"Ирина Евтеева","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/bPJTfHwrRR1LhmyChQ65DSg1jan.jpg","credit_id":"5faaf4762a09bc00408e678e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1827284,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Natalya Orlova","original_name":"Natalya Orlova","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/wJcgXWxKiccSpJa1VfKjzlMhvB2.jpg","credit_id":"5faaf4b5b6abc4003ef33e30","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Чайковский","popularity":0.3088,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"5faaf4de2a09bc00418ed930","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/ovuAicmw98PtsSXr1VYHXkEnUYY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
