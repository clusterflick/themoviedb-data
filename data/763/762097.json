Random or staged shots of people and settings in urban London are arranged and abstracted, double-exposed and solarized. The result is a dense texture filled with layers and associative dimensions.  Mass is a film attempting to convey, by strictly filmic means, the cooped-up feeling of the individual in the grey mass of the city. The absurd concrete city landscape is visualized through the unspoilt and naked eye of the camera in a concentrated mosaic of images and sound.","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":"/wsbIMyCdg1R9Ta00YmW6XT28LdZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28323,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Film Institute Production Board","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mass, or Monument for a Capitalist Society","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Sjöström","original_name":"Åsa Sjöström","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mg0zfAzpga7EAcemly6b939xvwh.jpg","credit_id":"5fa892b2211ce5003e853a33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96985,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Harvey","original_name":"Peter Harvey","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/c4PwmZMNre5QeK5FXzkzjd7djBK.jpg","credit_id":"5fa892fe1d820f0040c6661d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlie Ware","original_name":"Charlie Ware","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa893158c7b0f003e7950c5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":294,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mick Audsley","original_name":"Mick Audsley","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa89334211ce5003d844bcc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wsbIMyCdg1R9Ta00YmW6XT28LdZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
