During the day she cooks for hundreds of Tel Aviv's homeless. In the evenings she hugs abandoned babies in the birthing ward. Without human touch and the warmth of a hug, the abandoned babies won't develop properly and can even die. Ravit always wanted children of her own, but life dictated otherwise. As she turns 50, she decides that she too wants to be on love's receiving end, but that may prove to be a lot harder to find.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/i3nVcLOWC1j8XQGU5tKq0EV8ae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alone Together","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2187208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaniv Linton","original_name":"Yaniv Linton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624583c99451e7008c9fd01c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Einav Giat Goodman","original_name":"Einav Giat Goodman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645511c9d8f44e0db072743e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uriel Sinai","original_name":"Uriel Sinai","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645511d0091e620144d80fbd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Kedem","original_name":"Daniel Kedem","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645511b3c0442900e2f21609","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Tiberman","original_name":"Maya Tiberman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac712e1faed00404519fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sol Goodman","original_name":"Sol Goodman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac75c2f3b17003df12b8c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kineret Hay-Gillor","original_name":"Kineret Hay-Gillor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac73dd4d509003cffcff9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kineret Hay-Gillor","original_name":"Kineret Hay-Gillor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac76c72c13e004076f3fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Tiberman","original_name":"Maya Tiberman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac7738de0ae0040b92f03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687864,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ori Derdikman","original_name":"Ori Derdikman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac7da85c0a2003fdabafd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851231,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shai Bachar","original_name":"Shai Bachar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faac7fcb6abc4003ff2af14","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/12w2rjTPMXzGHskklKlmRiEmuaP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i3nVcLOWC1j8XQGU5tKq0EV8ae.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d1JplbDA3I9sZxBYs3jx6EDsBIC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w5jkHZMRix5qgIIuvuUrpA1z5FL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv Film Festival 2019","release_date":"2019-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Camerimage Film Festival 2020","release_date":"2020-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
