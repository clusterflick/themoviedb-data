Boutadjine creates his portraits of Third World artists such as Miriam Makeba, and Algerian figures such as Assia Djebar from pieces of paper torn from high end fashion magazines and other, glossy, glitzy publications. Using this material is as much an act of rejecting bourgeois standards, which are often anti-North African in France, as much as elevating these figures and making them the social and visual standard against which we should judge ourselves, not the runway models of Chanel.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":"/ayFubkDc5SKzL5IxFtWE7QWfYJn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nunfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pieces of Lives, Pieces of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4917634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mustapha Boutadjine","original_name":"Mustapha Boutadjine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e6b250e1c08155180765","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahmoud Darwish","original_name":"Mahmoud Darwich","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":"/xhPq0Q9yAChVksZdCFNDgKUPt8d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e652a7a34ef23ecb59ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Davis","original_name":"Angela Davis","popularity":0.3221,"profile_path":"/rCGiP5iycqFodkrxslZl19IsIcf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e6584827b3abd81808e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommie Smith","original_name":"Tommie Smith","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/mzgGaH7qyqY3GMI3cANpWxD96qV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e65f2a06f48f7eb19002","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Makeba","original_name":"Miriam Makeba","popularity":0.4683,"profile_path":"/b60qlVK0YIWQGkXX7g6GFxTplca.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e6684c16415309ae2c7a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salah Teskouk","original_name":"Salah Teskouk","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/dZsAvDff64UHhyPeBMy377khLMj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e67a8d242d637558324b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458406,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guem","original_name":"Guem","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zos99FZWbX3UJaueAAbhRA9JUpC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e71dcabf923c326a8cef","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4259846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleida Guevara","original_name":"Aleida Guevara","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d4e67227667e3b84946e7a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Benamra","original_name":"Stephanie Benamra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d4e83eea538641aec0f787","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458406,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guem","original_name":"Guem","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/zos99FZWbX3UJaueAAbhRA9JUpC.jpg","credit_id":"66d4e8804827b3abd81808f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamid Benamra","original_name":"Hamid Benamra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faad4ca1c0435003c386c52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5012400","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayFubkDc5SKzL5IxFtWE7QWfYJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
