All these days hundreds of relatives waited, and some continue to wait under the walls of the detention facility for their children, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, parents and friends. Detainees come out of prisons and tell about the violence and abuse which they experienced. Information about this is instantly spread on the Internet. People already know the truth.  Film director Andrey Kutsila will depict not the stories of torture victims themselves, but their relatives. Under the walls of the prison on Akrestsina street, they are in some emotional state of uncertainty, confusion and hope. The camera will “pick up” individual faces from the crowd and supposedly overhear conversations of Belarusians, filled with pain, anger and despair.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/46GGUSrvOI9u0DAHgPNJabralEu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117526,"logo_path":"/iKueQHLIkBg9NsBHV09z2srKu2B.png","name":"Belsat TV","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"5fa858806a300b003cf3e38c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"5fa8589a211ce5003e84d16d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13455058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/46GGUSrvOI9u0DAHgPNJabralEu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ru\", \"native_name\"=>\"Russian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
