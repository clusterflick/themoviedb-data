On his return to Santiago, Pinochet agreed to be interviewed. In front of the camera, the General and three members of the junta speak about their memories and political thoughts, artistic tastes and their family lives. From the interviews, conducted in an apparently cordial atmosphere, emerges an ironic portrait without concessions of their taste for order, efficiency and a certain \"ordinary fascism.\" By way of contrast, the families of victims and missing people endure a different reality.","popularity":0.1679,"poster_path":"/e7fo8qGDkteORO580Irjrl3sbcr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pinochet and His Three Generals","video":false,"vote_average":7.857,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augusto Pinochet","original_name":"Augusto Pinochet","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/9py6iOsoUjrIOipnT9WetYlayfI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60242ae0c669ad003fc3944f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José María Berzosa","original_name":"José María Berzosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc8058a20e6a5003b263d4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423896,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maurice Perrimond","original_name":"Maurice Perrimond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60242ba4bc2cb3003da3e018","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":10050,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Claude Brisson","original_name":"Jean-Claude Brisson","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60242bbabc2cb30040a346f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1944223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yves Valero","original_name":"Yves Valero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60242bedbc2cb3003da3e08b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2757957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claude Guisard","original_name":"Claude Guisard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60242c09c5ada500407e1e89","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4707058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7fo8qGDkteORO580Irjrl3sbcr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
