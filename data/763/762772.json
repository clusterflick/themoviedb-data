Ferruccio Razzini, fifteen-year-old from Pisa, fights in defense of the Italian Social Republic without knowing that Mussolini is already dead and that Italy has just been liberated. In his diary he tells the story of his father, a fervent fascist, and that of his two sisters, one married to a fascist and the other to a communist partisan. After Hit the Road, grandmother, Duccio Chiarini, with a refined stylistic code able to keep the narrative in balance between comedy and tragedy, investigates another side of the history of his family starting from the pages written by his great uncle.","popularity":0.2291,"poster_path":"/2hithDBpmnCDTLrGkKm0AfgHa94.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asmara Films","origin_country":""},{"id":43366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Règle du Jeu","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto Luce Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'occhio di vetro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gioietta Di Prete","original_name":"Gioietta Di Prete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60b3fd99a61de1006ef5f2a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Chiarini","original_name":"Alberto Chiarini","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60b3fda13e09f3002acd9791","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duccio Chiarini","original_name":"Duccio Chiarini","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60b3fdaa62e86f002b3d86a6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duccio Chiarini","original_name":"Duccio Chiarini","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b3fdd5aafebd0040bd683f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109185,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto Becucci","original_name":"Alberto Becucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b3fdeec490480059727cfa","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1589114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ginevra Elkann","original_name":"Ginevra Elkann","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/gxNNuaEtkBl88y790HuSAuO3rA9.jpg","credit_id":"60b3fe1968b1ea003fb6caa8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005672,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Enrica Gatto","original_name":"Enrica Gatto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b3fde0c740d90079d81b3b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesca Zanza","original_name":"Francesca Zanza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b3fe25a0664500414022b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duccio Chiarini","original_name":"Duccio Chiarini","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b3fdba6d1bb2006f188fbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11657782","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4RiMK4aPgqWtSvrQP4mwN2omLhA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2hithDBpmnCDTLrGkKm0AfgHa94.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1755,"name":"fascism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" Festival dei Popoli 2020","release_date":"2020-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
