A true professional in every sense, Stephen usually prefers to be seen acting rather than as himself.  However, one role set him apart - got him recognised. A role he played so quintessentially that he made it his own. As Travis in Blake’s 7, Stephen was Blake’s nemesis and his equal. A man to be reckoned with.  In this Myth Makers, Nicholas Briggs takes Stephen back to locations used for the Blake’s 7 story Duel and together they delve back into Stephen’s past… with a little help from an unseen friend.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 61: Stephen Greif","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Greif","original_name":"Stephen Greif","popularity":0.2764,"profile_path":"/xoxpKI8Y6EK0EC5o1uMvAguzsU3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"688538f480aff51a8555eba0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
