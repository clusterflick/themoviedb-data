The tiny island settled by Fletcher Christian and the other mutineers from HMS Bounty.  But in 2004 the British Pacific colony of Pitcairn - population 47 - won a notoriety that eclipsed its romantic past.  A five year police investigation revealed a long history of shocking child sex abuse.  The island was at the centre of world press attention - except that it's almost impossible to get there (the rocky island has no run-way, no roads no cars, no TV).  The trial of the accused men - held in the village hall - divided opinion.  How can the standards of normal life be applied to such a bizarre, remote community?  But then again why should the daughters of the islanders not be protected?  This remarkable film is a one-off.  No other TV crew or journalists were allowed on the island.  The twist is extraordinary.  The men are jailed in a prison they must themselves build.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble in Paradise: The Pitcairn Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
