The inspiration of his life and talent is woven into the true-to-life story of Jim Powell and Karen. Jim was a medical student who was going to specialize. In that way he figured a young doctor could avoid getting mixed up in the personal lives of his patients. He had styled himself as a cynic, was going to stay away from pitfalls of ideals. God, and the eternal and humanitarian needs of the world, until he met Karen, a young, attractive Christian nurse who had dedicated herself to the mission field and the service of her Lord. Her desire to tell Jim about Christ and to make him see the meaning, purpose, and the happiness of a Christ-centered life brings her own objectives into a stronger focus.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":245312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colburn Film Services","origin_country":""},{"id":269216,"logo_path":null,"name":"North Park College","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Son of Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Sallman","original_name":"Warner Sallman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Warner Sallman","credit_id":"68856b8f6199336bf12462ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomi Thurston","original_name":"Tomi Thurston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Karen Richards","credit_id":"68856b9f98c597f11a8a6a19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Simmons","original_name":"Eddie Simmons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jim Powell","credit_id":"68856bac39f21967c5d9b05a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Elders","original_name":"Harry Elders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chaplain Aldeen","credit_id":"68856bbc09a8f9ddc038faff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hope Summers","original_name":"Hope Summers","popularity":0.2568,"profile_path":"/6JVCwoKx9HlPh5leJLoNVtUlkmn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Johnson","credit_id":"68856bd1fbcc2b691738fbba","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5071800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Ushijima","original_name":"Henry Ushijima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68856cd4fe85a1d5452467a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5071800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Ushijima","original_name":"Henry Ushijima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68856cdc274b091f7652acaa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43973,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Shores","original_name":"Richard Shores","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68856d6f10093a50958a6a61","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arvid Nelson","original_name":"Arvid Nelson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68856d829f14f68eb2246740","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588532,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"A.E.
