No one responds. No one seems to be listening. Authority has been emptied of pathos, the voice has become a function, liturgy has been transformed into procedure.\r Shot on expired black-and-white Super 8 film, with an old digital color video camera and archival sound material, the film traverses a fragmented and opaque reality, where the substance of the image is consumed along with the world it is supposed to represent.\r The film presents itself as a damaged liturgical object,\r a magnetic relic that still transmits, but from an elsewhere already emptied of grace.\r A fragment of the end, caught in the act of its stalemate.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/89z7MWfLKKtlquq2JxJBSCz6acU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Revelation: How I Was Struck at No. 29 Parrocchia Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"L'annuncio, come venni folgorato a Via Parrocchia 29","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Il folgorato","credit_id":"6883bb48274b091f7652a530","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6883bb58fbcc2b691738f3d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6883bb6ab94e667f8b52a6b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/89z7MWfLKKtlquq2JxJBSCz6acU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
