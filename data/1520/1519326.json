But the ghosts of the past catch up with him and he ends up losing not only his power but his sanity. Russia sinks ever deeper into a mire of corruption, intrigue and coups.  In his grand choral opera, Modest Mussorgsky deals with a theme that offers poignant parallels to today’s world: the extremes to which one man’s thirst for power can lead. The director Kirill Serebrennikov incorporates his own experiences in Russia to present his take on an opera about political turmoil and its consequences. Serebrennikov’s production focuses on the effect on the people of high-stakes political scheming. Conductor Vasily Petrenko makes his Amsterdam debut leading the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. A top-flight cast is led bass-baritone Tomasz Konieczny, celebrated for his ability to get into the skin of his characters both vocally and dramatically, singing the title role for the first time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kGUSG39lUfkr2cFFoXmtJpnuAMg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":131385,"logo_path":null,"name":"OperaVision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":181,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
