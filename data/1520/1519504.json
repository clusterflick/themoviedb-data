Three times the King demands she does so, promising marriage. If she fails, her life is forfeit. Three times she despairs until Rumpelstiltskin appears, spinning straw into gold in exchange for a gift. The third time the girl promises her first born child to Rumpelstiltskin, should she be queen.

He will only relent if within three days the queen can guess his name.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l7xLXWE7TV2qfywHz0oK6KrVcrO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Footwork Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumpelstilzchen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2607455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bailey Pepper","original_name":"Bailey Pepper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bailiff","credit_id":"6884ef35cd0a0d7884f7850d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2300262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Davis","original_name":"Edward Davis","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/iq3u5jaYMn4yPasJc47eKT242QB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bailiff","credit_id":"6884ef433c48c4a5bf72eb75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Marquez","original_name":"John Marquez","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":"/oLajtdcnQG9Ep0WIXhZ5lo2r6QW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Miller","credit_id":"6884ef54cd0a0d7884f78511","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2382306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Francis-Swaby","original_name":"Daniel Francis-Swaby","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/qY4rJaYeBEN5eKWKJ2fGSxiPhyV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"King","credit_id":"6884ef625acf69a81f52a8ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Horrocks","original_name":"Jane Horrocks","popularity":0.7075,"profile_path":"/phYKQdBZgRwMT8w6ZEhvGc8zgvB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rumpelstilzchen","credit_id":"6884ef74e4afd09aec72e853","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1731959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Reynolds","original_name":"Tanya Reynolds","popularity":0.9565,"profile_path":"/m5FP6lzbxYon8W6hEvj9d4h21i4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"6884ef8165f0807e59d9ad4a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884eec9e4afd09aec72e83b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5398186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884eeff3855a701642468a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacob Grimm","original_name":"Jacob Grimm","popularity":0.202,"profile_path":"/4HTsSB1QyKnZJOeEFTWlMEeHaYo.jpg","credit_id":"6884ef142b930fb6d552aa2e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595259,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sarah Fahie","original_name":"Sarah Fahie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884effb0f25d300c352ad72","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Sawer","original_name":"David Sawer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884f011223102bc3e55ee4f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16711926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l7xLXWE7TV2qfywHz0oK6KrVcrO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
