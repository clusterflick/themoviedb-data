A secret witch named Shelley Van Dembewbs is murdered by her lover — Mayor Daniel Deekless — after she threatens to expose their affair to his wife, Valerie. Wanting to protect his reputation and political power, the mayor strangles Shelley and buries her in an unmarked grave outside the town cemetery.  But Shelley's soul doesn’t rest.  During the next blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — her spirit casts a revenge curse on the town. The spell seeps into the soil, awakening ancient vampires sealed in tombs under the graveyard.","popularity":0.2,"poster_path":"/7UJGFns2yAhy0BjUAvp4wpBcb4W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
