Steshenko, active with Kyiv’s Parostky Theatre, uses TV drama conventions in his play “In Memory of Antonina Nikolayevna on Lost Love” to expose societal dysfunction. The film retains Steshenko’s unique language and employs soap opera aesthetics, including local TV stars, to convey estrangement, portraying society as a chaotic conflict.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/6fy0NCLEGix6kTsbEzEnS48PMpq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Memory of Antonina Nikolayevna on Lost Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Steshenko","original_name":"Oleksandr Steshenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688545585a859be9d5f787e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kateryna Libkind","original_name":"Kateryna Libkind","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688545659f14f68eb2246622","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3873553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavlo Yurov","original_name":"Павло Юров","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68854577da3bd92a1a55eef3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2615330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Khimei","original_name":"Roman Khimei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wNBzmZoWKdOPNlXSrwKgqJOk4Ne.jpg","credit_id":"6885458b8af0071dab8a6af0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5588264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yarema Malaschuk","original_name":"Yarema Malaschuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688545a739849ffe8dd9aed7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6fy0NCLEGix6kTsbEzEnS48PMpq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
