A woman who lives in an isolated cottage in the forest rescued the injured man. When the unconscious man wakes up, he sees a hand-made cello in the room. \"My dead son made it,\" she says. He asks if he can play the cello. She brings the cell to him and he begins playing sarabande from Bach's Suite No. 3 with his wounded hands.  The ghost of her dead son wanders in the forest and around his mother's cottage with a kettle to draw water, but only birds can see the ghost, not the mother.  One day the mother hears the sound of a kettle.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/suN6KKNDi3iBWFcowqytqjr1kh4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FOREST ISLAND / 2022","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"kazuko mogami","original_name":"kazuko mogami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"mother","credit_id":"6884f7a81600dcfb76246320","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"keiun kim","original_name":"keiun kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"spirits of the trees","credit_id":"6884f7dc096e0ed3fb72e852","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryosuke Handa","original_name":"Ryosuke Handa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884f7823c48c4a5bf72ebc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ryosuke Handa","original_name":"Ryosuke Handa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884f7fc38bd91079155eb44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/suN6KKNDi3iBWFcowqytqjr1kh4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
