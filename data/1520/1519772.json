Through archival imagery and alternative spaces like Enclave Caracol, located in the city’s historic downtown, the film reflects on memory, erasure, and the urgent need to tell our own stories. It portrays resistance as something built from the inner, the collective, and the marginal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/YPKvnoOc4SgVYJArV4SLv2TKDs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post
