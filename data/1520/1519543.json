Dina’s whirlwind nature unleashes the congregation into an electrifying spiritual renewal. But when the emergence of torrid secrets of sexual violence and pregnancy without options threatens their getaway, Dina and Bev’s relationship is tested as they discover that even as we brokenly rip one another to shreds, each of us is aching to know love, forgiveness…and goddammit, a little bit of grace.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ezgTUqkheoz3qptqhxbjMLls8hB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spit Me Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3209866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilia Isorelýs Paulino","original_name":"Ilia Isorelýs Paulino","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/umG4luSFvavsa5PL7wfJeALf4pi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68850483ee63f2da1116bddf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1725576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Becca Blackwell","original_name":"Becca Blackwell","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/uieDJ7TSYgAZsXdUH4ZR5kzUaKW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"688504902c5aa3134538f9da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daya Curley","original_name":"Daya Curley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68850498468d79140272eb43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasper","original_name":"Kasper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"688504b0d098f600d972e778","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4609864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezra Reaves","original_name":"Ezra Reaves","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":"/d1QaWJJh8phnNeIupeDvuygzuMb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"688504bb0213a4f73538f86f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2719281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor E.
