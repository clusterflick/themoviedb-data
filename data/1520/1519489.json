With no commentary or censorship, the film gives voice to those caught in a war imposed on their land — a war often overlooked by European audiences. Created in 2019, it aimed to spark awareness of the conflict’s human cost and our collective responsibility for peace.  After 2022, the war expanded across Ukraine, and the suffering once confined to Donbas became nationwide. The film now stands as a reminder of unheard voices and missed chances to prevent a larger tragedy.","popularity":0.2571,"poster_path":"/wrfnUtg2jK0WLl8KEonAWoC6KDW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Donbass children / 2019","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lubomir Dankov","original_name":"Lubomir Dankov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884e487730ab572b68a6788","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673872,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zina Nacheva","original_name":"Zina Nacheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6884e7e8df411187b516be26","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/wrfnUtg2jK0WLl8KEonAWoC6KDW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lY8QcaRrxz01SiBRKPwHhAZX6DJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oTaAt7xBrOX5vcYD8FJ9JTYXQW2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eu40pXFWsVNDqnv4QVjrMTq9zyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
