She discusses how she felt confused for many of her younger years because she didn’t feel attraction and talks about past relationships to demonstrate various aspects of her frustrations. Growing up without any exposure to queer love, she never knew that her feelings were valid, and she felt broken. Clara comforts Aurora by telling her that she experienced similar things and that a lot of lesbians go through similar thought processes in a heteronormative society. Aurora ends her story by explaining how she found herself after moving cities and seeing queer people exist around her. She then met Clara and fell in love, finally feeling safe, found and understood.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/eFKX36ugnMz7aJIfIRDe5mfx721.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Through All the Moving Colours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ajani Hastings","original_name":"Ajani Hastings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6885072f4993f24968246848","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5541521,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Koyuki Mark","original_name":"Koyuki Mark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6885073c317a5cfe9cf78a43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yanik Savoie","original_name":"Yanik Savoie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68850745dc231ac119f785d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Laïny Trozzo-Monet","original_name":"Jo Laïny Trozzo-Monet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6885076be242da0f0f55ecf5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Johanne Elliott","original_name":"Tatiana Johanne Elliott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6885069b4993f24968246825","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Johanne Elliott","original_name":"Tatiana Johanne Elliott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688506a239849ffe8dd9ae07","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36847128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eFKX36ugnMz7aJIfIRDe5mfx721.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
