Dozens of hippies from Sweden, France, Japan and other countries arrive at the Chornobyl station after their boycott of a nuclear testing site in Nevada. The foreign youths are greeted by the local elderly self-settlers, who by force of habit continue to sell mushrooms along the road. Covering their bodies in paint, the visitors head to the fourth reactor to enact an anti-nuclear performance.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/rGnnqm4duWrYCMSqnlz0GvYBpCs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207864,"logo_path":"/b4Qi3miwn0awtH4idEHPjbJjaHr.png","name":"Ukrtelefilm","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death Cloud of Chornobyl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Death Cloud of Chernobyl","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5587649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A.
