There are several settings showing children of all ages and varying degrees of the disease progression and recovery. One setting is a group treatment home, the children are cared for round the clock by caring competent doctors, nurses and physical therapists. They use toys and games that are typical for their age/development and the era to challenge and encourage the children to learn to use their affected limbs to overcome the disease's devastating effects. Ms. Garson encourages the public to donate their time, effort and funds to help the medical community in their efforts to halt, cure and eradicate the disease. It is encouraging to see these smiling and happy children, who although affected by this terrible disease, nonetheless have a bright future. It is a warm short treatment for a difficult subject.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1944-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Report from Miss Greer Garson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7634084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
