Gerald, who lives in the remote countryside near Paris, hears from a traveler that he is Louis XVII. Imprisoned with his parents Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette at the Tour du Temple, it is believed that he was killed as well after his parents were executed, but he is now told that he was secretly saved and brought away, and the body of the child in the Temple was a substitute. The traveler is wracked with illness, and after passing over a ring bearing the seal of Louis XVI, he dies. Being ambitious, Gerald decides to make use of this piece of evidence. What fate awaits this young man claiming to be Louis XVII...? Rallying against callous fate, he rises up in a world where he is surrounded by people of ambition and treachery, and amidst that callous fate the one ray of light comes from Anne, the girl Gerald loves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tlQngEwJRPA6pEWhGXqOmYA038P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Prayer -Louis XVII Lost in the Revolution-","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
