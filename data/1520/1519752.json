Extensive swamps, a complex river system, and numerous lakes bear witness to the glaciers that once covered the area. It is unique because it contains so many different types of natural swamps. The \"Big Five\" of European wildlife live here in one place: bear, wolf, lynx, bison, and elk. And the black grouse, which has become extremely rare in Europe, gathers here every April for mating season. It is an extraordinary spectacle when the imposing blue-black black grouses make their courtship calls in the swamps. Those who immerse themselves in the world of the Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve gain an incomparable insight into the vast mosaic of floodplain forests, lakes, and acidic peat bogs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kfd80vZwdqjhO1yh73bDiZetFSC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sumpfland Taiga - Das Berezinsky-Biosphärenreservat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les perles de la taïga- La réserve de Berezinsky","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Hardorf","original_name":"Alexandra Hardorf","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/6RYWk8TYcXAdP1QdFd0atpjG1fa.jpg","credit_id":"6885598d3d8d9dfd9038f608","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18072700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/elnJc1iIXnWvuka1jZSMpVYBlIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3zvIBUxbGzp0W3PfRtgFf7C2gQE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kfd80vZwdqjhO1yh73bDiZetFSC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
