Far from Sweden, she plunges into a wild life with bohemians from around the world. She falls in love, gets exploited, takes drugs, and exploits others. Her life is forever shaped by these years and these people. A life on the fringe.  In The Wild Ones she travels to places like New York, Paris and Rome, returning to former lovers of both sexes. They face their choices and the consequences. Was it truly free to live like that? Was it worth it?","popularity":0.1676,"poster_path":"/qA5e3LP4cLlSCUgM7ian4OIAT7A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atmo Media Network","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild Ones","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mitchelle Blair: House Of Horror Documentary","type":"Documentary"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Birgitta Stenberg","original_name":"Birgitta Stenberg","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Birgitta Stenberg","credit_id":"52fe4c95c3a36847f8235541","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5029422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Belletti","original_name":"Isabella Belletti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"6720dafa4be15469e70e6ec8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5029423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cox","original_name":"Richard Cox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"6720db19769107d77b488133","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5029424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ericsson","original_name":"David Ericsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"6720db3134c0fabd681d599a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5029425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette E.
