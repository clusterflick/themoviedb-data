In one sequence Jefferson Airplane's Lather asks the question, ‘Is it true I'm no longer young?’ Time makes us prisoners locked in ourselves, like the a small yellow bird who slips behind the back of a playing card, then comes back out in front of it. In rapid alternation, they make a kind of thaumatrope, that spinning parlor trick that suggests a sense of movement in the flapping wings of a caged bird. Here the birdcage has been replaced by chance, underscoring the momentary illusion that the bird is free.\" - Genevieve Yue","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"False Aging","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Klahr","original_name":"Lewis Klahr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c9dc3a36847f8236edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2364657","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2009-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
