Render: Spanning Time With Ani DiFranco is a documentary which follows DiFranco on the road during her world tours of 2000 and 2001 (while also incorporating performance footage dating back as far as 1997). Observing both her performances on-stage as well as her interactions with friends, associates, and fellow musicians off-stage, the film offers an insight into how DiFranco's songs take shape in performance, as well as documenting her gifts as a singer and guitarist.","popularity":0.0834,"poster_path":"/dF7NbMLZuhmaFByXPtzdC0lw27n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Render: Spanning Time with Ani DiFranco","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ani DiFranco","original_name":"Ani DiFranco","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/w0JjgRP6J6dqTHkdRXmhMuAhE8T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca3c3a36847f8237ea5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ani DiFranco","original_name":"Ani DiFranco","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/w0JjgRP6J6dqTHkdRXmhMuAhE8T.jpg","credit_id":"5a8b7c8d0e0a2653db08e8e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2310596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clement Goldberg","original_name":"Clement Goldberg","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678b09171afc34646764d618","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0359894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1229,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dF7NbMLZuhmaFByXPtzdC0lw27n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":861}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
