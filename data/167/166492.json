We were staying at a friend's house. We worked our way through the city and eventually made it to the island. We followed each other around. We enjoyed ourselves. We said we were going to make a film about each other - and we did”. A & B in Ontario was completed eighteen years after the original material was shot. After Frampton's death, the film was assembled by Wieland into a cinematic dialogue in which the collaborators shoot each other with cameras.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/3DT8pZO795g3HauXnMM0cdAhj8r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A and B in Ontario","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hollis Frampton","original_name":"Hollis Frampton","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/94kbHx8NNf5WlZZlq6F94coSmyL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53c834a5c3a3686255004479","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joyce Wieland","original_name":"Joyce Wieland","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/wgTirg2kbwxKgadediO72njnWs0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53c834adc3a368625500447b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hollis Frampton","original_name":"Hollis Frampton","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/94kbHx8NNf5WlZZlq6F94coSmyL.jpg","credit_id":"53c8348ac3a368624b0042cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joyce Wieland","original_name":"Joyce Wieland","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/wgTirg2kbwxKgadediO72njnWs0.jpg","credit_id":"53c83495c3a368624b0042cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0300899","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1009,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3DT8pZO795g3HauXnMM0cdAhj8r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
