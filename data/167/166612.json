Based on a play by Owen Davis Sr., the film  casts Errol as James Wilson, a kleptomaniac who starts with picking  pockets and ends up robbing a bank. Wilson's friend Lawrence Payne  (Richard Arlen) inadvertently aids our hero during one of his heists,  ending up in deep doo-doo with the law. Before Wilson is able to  extricate Payne from his dilemma for the sake of heroine Barbara Tanner  (Mary Brian), he pauses long enough to pose as a private eye -- and even  gives bellboy Oscar (Stu Erwin) tips on how to spot a crook! If only all of  Leon Errol's feature films had been as consistently hilarious as Only Saps  Work.","popularity":0.9894,"poster_path":"/9rsZNQl6gtl211zvfpfu3RYCl8W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":199948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Publix Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You Just Know It's Funny!","title":"Only Saps Work","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Errol","original_name":"Leon Errol","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/8jV6d5rKmmXn69TRbm4Ndehdrpr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"James Wilson","credit_id":"52fe4c9fc3a36847f8237577","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Arlen","original_name":"Richard Arlen","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/dDr230NdMlxt4BC0OxwG0pJZV7t.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Larry Payne","credit_id":"52fe4c9fc3a36847f823757b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Brian","original_name":"Mary Brian","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/ikRdqKBJ7UCAB1xNb67dVSYoOyZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Barbara Tanner","credit_id":"52fe4c9fc3a36847f823757f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Erwin","original_name":"Stuart Erwin","popularity":0.8025,"profile_path":"/yO5OCvQmwUsi0WS7kbDUvYCMHQi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Oscar","credit_id":"52fe4c9fc3a36847f8237583","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anderson Lawler","original_name":"Anderson Lawler","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/s90N3VUjfbySsySeT6MJjJM8u5c.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Horace Baldwin","credit_id":"552adebbc3a36859cf004d10","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Grapewin","original_name":"Charley Grapewin","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/xROPwMkTUgweYQFhbTsvklIMhlw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Simeon Tanner","credit_id":"552adea4c3a36858d60040ce","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"Sergeant Burns (uncredited)","credit_id":"676a3e5845cc55ffb764aeea","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":981098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Cecil","original_name":"Nora Cecil","popularity":0.52,"profile_path":"/cQa0cwlxAdqwU52dw05gpJB3RSH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Partridge (uncredited)","credit_id":"552adee4925141288b000328","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chandler","original_name":"George Chandler","popularity":0.4722,"profile_path":"/fXj6FdgWPp8om9O2HD2Uv4yhcBi.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Elevator Operator (uncredited)","credit_id":"552adf109251410876003f5e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.
