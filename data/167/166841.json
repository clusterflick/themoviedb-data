The legendary Canto-pop duo, who were famous for their socially conscious songs, sought to deliver through their timeless music a nostalgic and sentimental trip back in time as well as sociopolitical messages that were as relevant to contemporary Hong Kong as they had ever been. In addition to performing newly rearranged versions of their golden hits, Anthony Wong and Tats Lau also presented their new song It's My Party and an updated version of \"Named in No Particular Order\".  The concert is now available on Blu-ray with 153 minutes of live footage in high definition, plus 10 concert MVs.","popularity":0.2219,"poster_path":"/5NLpnWlk77rhjM49SdsvhtiM53V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Asia Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2012-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tat Ming Pair Live","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"兜兜轉轉演演唱唱會Live","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tats Lau Yee-Tat","original_name":"劉以達","popularity":0.3625,"profile_path":"/8UVwCgTn5TLFEGwsRl6UaQhJC8g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f9412b03ff2df0033ae3ff4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Wong Yiu-Ming","original_name":"Anthony Wong Yiu-Ming","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/wGt3cEzVQrF8fHMdt8N0uC3ZV49.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62ee084a172d7f007e7b6b47","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/xTQvTiuZIzu9SRCWr79viJqVwW6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1896},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/bE8Q2dFNnq3V0Xce5gEpekVDiYG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/dTgL3bhEdwKYVXMAWE3kT1fs3XO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.746,"height":1119,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/5NLpnWlk77rhjM49SdsvhtiM53V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":835}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
