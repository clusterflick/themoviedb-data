These relationships reflect, metaphorically, the changing political situation in South Africa at the time the film was made. Demonstrations and marches in opposition to the apartheid r√©gime together with the governmental relaxation of most of the State of Emergency regulations and restrictions heralded the beginning of a change in the country's power structure (and white attitudes towards black African rights). Soho, a symbol of South African white power, develops the capacity for awareness, longing and love and the potential for guilt and repentance.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sobriety, Obesity & Growing Old","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","title":"Sobriety, Obesity and Growing Old","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Kentridge","original_name":"William Kentridge","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/e5wLYqybCfMJdCr5vTZ4SDxedpc.jpg","credit_id":"54087074c3a368582c00105d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225396,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angus Gibson","original_name":"Angus Gibson","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5408708cc3a368582c00105f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Kentridge","original_name":"William Kentridge","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/e5wLYqybCfMJdCr5vTZ4SDxedpc.jpg","credit_id":"5408707ec3a36858300010c5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1663947","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
