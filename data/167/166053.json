His career never amounted to much, as he managed only a couple of acting jobs on TV. Without warning, he returns to his hometown and drops in on his sister who is in the throes of a sordid affair with her married boss. Later, Robert drops in on his younger brother, who lives with his elderly mother. As the film progresses, it quietly, sensitively depicts Robert's disruption of the lives of the members of his family.","popularity":0.3635,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Balenciaga","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre Régional des Ressources Audiovisuelles (CRRAV)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inséparables","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Frot","original_name":"Catherine Frot","popularity":0.5073,"profile_path":"/mLYcrvglYGoPEjwBB5jyUe2ku8e.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Gisèle","credit_id":"53316b489251410b600012ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","popularity":0.4378,"profile_path":"/bFIJ3bdn5bjx3r5Tm4VPjlaxwfr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"53316b6a9251410b4e00132e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabienne Babe","original_name":"Fabienne Babe","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/cOny64DetoolafEsbqinPxdTmIN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Loulou","credit_id":"53316b8b9251410b600012f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Bouajila","original_name":"Sami Bouajila","popularity":0.7001,"profile_path":"/xq8TMMCA4RI2omGxbPtLVsBMWX8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Boris","credit_id":"53316bad9251410b5400130f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Roüan","original_name":"Brigitte Roüan","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/tXqmCIkqEp8sI6cnfokNrSsLl05.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Martine","credit_id":"53316bd19251410b54001313","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hervé Pierre","original_name":"Hervé Pierre","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/zrorzRqdKqbZVNws404U13Ypxf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"53316bf59251410b41001444","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438263,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Couvelard","original_name":"Michel Couvelard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5500da37c3a3685ba6002110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438263,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Couvelard","original_name":"Michel Couvelard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5500da40c3a3685ba200229b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216834","wikidata_id":"Q3152972","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
