This is the story of Pat Tillman, a young 27-year-old man who used to earn $2 million a season and left the football field in order to volunteer with the U.S. Army and then ended up dying in Afghanistan. But his death during battle is a mystery that upsets Americans and troubles the White House. For weeks the Pentagon affirmed that he had died heroically, killed by an enemy Taliban attack. But then the truth came to light: Pat Tillman was killed by his own fellow soldiers. So, how did he really die? His mother Mary Tillman, during an exclusive interview, states how she is trying to discover the truth behind her son's death.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friendly Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4229100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Tillman","original_name":"Mary Tillman","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6629719c4a4bf6013276b6e6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federica Cellini","original_name":"Federica Cellini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629718fe295b401879e3036","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federica Cellini","original_name":"Federica Cellini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66297193344a8e0166af3336","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1485712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
