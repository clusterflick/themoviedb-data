Home? - Certainly not by a stretch of this little computer animation. A lone kidney bean is being given the rough treatment by two much larger, bullying lima beans. In a number of fancy manoeuvres the kidney bean tricks the bullying two into believing theyâ€™ve killed him. When the kidney bean reaches his kin a battle of revenge is planned. The plan is foiled once ensconced in battle by the true ruler - the one who cooks beans in the kitchen. The battle scenes are stylistically similar to and remniscent of the battle scenes in the paintings of Australian artist, John Bracks, where he used pencils and decks of cards symbolically and as structural elements to recreate battle scenes.","popularity":0.1766,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53479,"logo_path":"/9bx7uOH4E2Xbmxl8kWng28LgLWO.png","name":"Australian Film Television and Radio School","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1998-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two tribes, one table, lots of fun ... there can be only one!","title":"Has Beans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut Bakaitis","original_name":"Helmut Bakaitis","popularity":0.3352,"profile_path":"/p7YMk9Gk2BZsvo2EUp7x903gdLZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lima Beans (voice)","credit_id":"66291e684a4bf601657724aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668516,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew Tamandl","original_name":"Andrew Tamandl","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Kidney Beans (voice)","credit_id":"66291e7763d937016474159a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668516,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew Tamandl","original_name":"Andrew Tamandl","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291dc54a4bf601887789cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668516,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew Tamandl","original_name":"Andrew Tamandl","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291dcfcb6db500caad6f1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2018400,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miriam Stein","original_name":"Miriam Stein","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291de4e942ee017f6ba4ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571814,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toby Gorman","original_name":"Toby Gorman","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291df1176a94017f836568","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668516,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew Tamandl","original_name":"Andrew Tamandl","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291dfb176a940133816a21","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411522,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luke Dunn Gielmuda","original_name":"Luke Dunn Gielmuda","popularity":0.2288,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291e08221ba6017c18ab2e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718283,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Linda Murdoch","original_name":"Linda Murdoch","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291e12176a94017f83657c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151282,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Niki Bern","original_name":"Niki Bern","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291e26a13533017e18301d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1864804,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John Breslin","original_name":"John Breslin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291e33cb6db50186b37e47","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Digital Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4672520,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Timothy McCallum","original_name":"Timothy McCallum","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291e47cb6db50186b37e5b","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668516,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andrew Tamandl","original_name":"Andrew Tamandl","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66291e54b9a0bd017ad9fbc3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0757890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7dqBwRFrBLUTCbb2aPM2NpARgK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"AFTRS screening tour","release_date":"1998-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
