For some mothers, who don't fit into 'society norm,' this has become a day of anxiety, fear and self consciousness.  The Other Mother's Day is a semi-personal film by Thai filmmmaker Duangtawan Sirikoon that acts as an experimental celebration of what an inclusive mother's day would feel like for a group of mothers that have been made to feel like they are 'other', outcasts, something their children are acutely aware of. A group of mothers who are: transgender; in a gay couple; in extreme poverty; covered in tattoos.  Motherhood is expressed through the opinions and cheer of both children and mother - leaving us with the abundantly clear message: why on Earth would anyone/ society question the sanctity of these children's relationships with their rightful, loving mothers? And who's really doing the damage to the children's esteem?","popularity":0.2308,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Any kind of mother is a mother, not by gender not by birth but by their hearts.","title":"The Other Mother's Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duangtawan Sirikoon","original_name":"Duangtawan Sirikoon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629a5107a1bd6011d22bfb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173983,"name":"mother's day"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
