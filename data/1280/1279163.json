With their friend Eliot now kidnapped, they show up uninvited to their former friend Max's place, where he is having a wonderful gender reveal party. They try to convince him that his boss- Dr. Sam Enshorts- is partner in the conspiracy, and that they watched him commit murder, but Max forcefully asks them to leave, thinking they are just jealous of his new life without them. Before they can exit, however, Dr. Sam cajoles them into a high stakes dart game, which leads to them accidentally popping the gender revealing balloon all over Max, humiliating him publicly, and causing Dr. Sam to lose a critical piece of software, so now he too wants the Pompano Boys dead.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":227006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Post Relative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three Bros vs a Gender Reveal Party & Tom Krews","title":"Pompano Boys and the Gender Reveal Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3419741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Anderwald","original_name":"Dana Anderwald","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/85GSmhCKi5ofhvBygASU2y5p6J7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cassie","credit_id":"66285bcacb6db50186b2949c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1737038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Marguerite Cullivan","original_name":"Ellen Marguerite Cullivan","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/8Wv3JYYhiSisZ3DIcRSDrYzDAMH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Susan - Cassie's Mother","credit_id":"66285bd962f3350131d7b178","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4671589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garrett Andrew Ahrens","original_name":"Garrett Andrew Ahrens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1GiwZovXDmG9CoNDOUf6uecILnW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Sam Enshorts","credit_id":"66285be4af9590016469ac65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2648287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian D.
