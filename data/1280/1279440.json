During 50 days 50 dancers and choreographers were practising two dance techniques: “Passing Through” and “Flying Low”. Inspiring message and practising of these techniques become the subject for installation that include photography and a documentary. My aim was to illustrate mainly the “Passing Through” technique, which base on working on instant composition. This technique reflects not only in a dance room but also in everyday life, by teaching us freedom of thought and developing individual’s awareness, so as to become an element of the whole group’s awareness. Following this idea I created an installation that contain large prints with images of dancers in their dynamic motion. The installation is accompanied by a documentary, which introduces the viewer in to the story about constant movements in nature, in which we are put into.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Zambrano","original_name":"David Zambrano","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66290102221ba6017c189b7b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4672350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amira Bochenska","original_name":"Amira Bochenska","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66290086cb6db50163b06d01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
