Even her 25th birthday must be celebrated with a bang, even though the coffers are empty and the people are waiting for their paychecks. The estate’s main creditor, Mr. Darnley, sends an agent to get a grip on the failing finances, but the pressure eventually becomes too much for Evelyn, so she chooses to declare bankruptcy. As the people storm the castle, she and the agent must flee to a hunting lodge in the forest, where Evelyn – in primitive conditions and without a maid – discovers the joy of manual labour. Meanwhile, some romance crops up between Evelyn and the agent, who turns out not to be who he claimed.
