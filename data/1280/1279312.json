The box of phonographs that remained in his parents' house led Iioka, who only had memories of his grandfather from his childhood, to begin research in Hinosato, Munakata City, Fukuoka Prefecture, where he was an art teacher at a high school. The film “Hinosato” does not attempt to explain the circumstances at all. What is shown are scenes of the town as it is today, as if the camera had become transparent, as if the people were unaware that they were being filmed.  Three times flow out: the present day in the village, the diary that shows the grandfather's time in the past, and the picture that connects the two.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hinosato","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013796,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yukiko Iioka","original_name":"Yukiko Iioka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628acc3a13533017e17f059","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
