What started out as a protest toward a simple high school student council election, erupted into a three day bloody gun battle between local and national armed forces and the local African American community members and African American students at a local Historically Black College University (HBCU). During the unrest, 650 National Guardsmen stormed the university's campus with the help of planes and helicopter to overtake the revolting student body. Only one person was killed, a ROTC student, who's death is the oldest cold case in Greensboro, NC history. The documentary gives an in-depth look into the controversial hotbed of racial strife and protests in the late 1960s.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5FG0sAqCrKevQ3TkXEqKZdIcAr4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walls That Bleed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Williams","original_name":"Michael Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66298fd3ca8354011f582333","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2089854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5FG0sAqCrKevQ3TkXEqKZdIcAr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
