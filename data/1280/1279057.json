For our favourite meals, it is a collection of ingredients coming together to form a taste that gives us comfort. For our homes, it is a collection of memorabilia, items, trinkets, and decorations that come together in a way that is representative of who we are. Our families are a group of several individuals who play different roles in our lives and come together to form our support system. For the Queer community, friends collectively join to form a support system that plays an essential role in their happiness and survival in a homophobic world. The human experience is collaborative and a collection of things that shape our lives. This documentary shows how the people in Alexâ€™s life come together to keep them afloat.","popularity":0.4733,"poster_path":"/eJg2r0Kgo1YRS2JZI5kxf0Dv9nw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Serving more than just a meal.","title":"There's No Place Like Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Apostolidis","original_name":"Alex Apostolidis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alex Apostolidis","credit_id":"66282030cb6db50163afc4b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Holzberg","original_name":"Max Holzberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Max Holzberg","credit_id":"66282040221ba6017c176af6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Lahbabi-Granger","original_name":"Felix Lahbabi-Granger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Felix Lahbabi-Granger","credit_id":"662820562e2b2c01876a4932","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fraser Place","original_name":"Fraser Place","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Fraser Place","credit_id":"66282060af9590014a67c163","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668558,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Moreno Kris","original_name":"Sophie Moreno Kris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66281f692e2b2c01496636ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671224,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lia Lee","original_name":"Lia Lee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66281fdd2e2b2c01306590ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pooja Sethi","original_name":"Pooja Sethi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66282071af95900164697cb9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pooja Sethi","original_name":"Pooja Sethi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66281f59176a94017f8231d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668559,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Samarika Dhiman","original_name":"Samarika Dhiman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66281f9262f3350164d9f98f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671220,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Will Scanlon","original_name":"Will Scanlon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66281fa2cb6db50186b244ca","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32590176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":860,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJg2r0Kgo1YRS2JZI5kxf0Dv9nw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":162357,"name":"observatory"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
