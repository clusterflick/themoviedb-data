In this short film, we will explore the charming streets, picturesque views, and breathtaking panoramas of this magical place. Through a game of hide-and-seek, we will reveal its hidden beauties, showing how this picturesque town responds to a literary critique from a bygone era.  Luigi Pirandello, a renowned Italian playwright and writer, wrote the novella \"Notte\" (Night) after a brief stay as a professor at the Istituto Magistrale Bertrando Spaventa during state exams. In it, he did not describe the Abruzzo village in the best light. This visual journey combines tradition and modernity, art and nature, in an affectionate response to Pirandello's words.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":"/91O75KEe8C43ozGU1CkRYAmDprY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Caro Pirandello, avevi torto!","title":"Dear Pirandello, you're wrong!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Lupinetti","original_name":"Davide Lupinetti","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628f7ec39549a013200ec20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4664983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Roveda","original_name":"Davide Roveda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628f88c63d937018776c966","department":"Art","job":"Co-Art Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4664983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Roveda","original_name":"Davide Roveda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628f810a39d0b0189483dba","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Lupinetti","original_name":"Davide Lupinetti","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628f80391f0ea017e01161b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4672322,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Davide Zazzini","original_name":"Davide Zazzini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628f84aa13533017e18210d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marzio Santoro","original_name":"Marzio Santoro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628f860221ba6017c189619","department":"Art","job":"Co-Art Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91O75KEe8C43ozGU1CkRYAmDprY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
