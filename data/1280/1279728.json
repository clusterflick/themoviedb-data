There, she witnessed children born with severe disabilities due to the effects of Agent Orange, even 30 years after the war, and the families who nurtured and cared for them. Although Vietnam has achieved remarkable economic development since then, the victims and their families have been left behind. The film depicts these people, the doctors who continue their support activities, and the former journalists who filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government and the company that produced the defoliant, as they continue to face the scars of the war.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/ncYZAh2F3afpTbmOnGY6PVkxpJn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Time Passing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3485141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masako Sakata","original_name":"Masako Sakata","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629953e1dcb77011bd035ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3485141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masako Sakata","original_name":"Masako Sakata","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629954a75f1ad011ebf5089","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2971202,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yūji Ōshige","original_name":"大重裕二","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66299561ca8354011e582455","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635514,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takeshi Ogawa","original_name":"小川武","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629956bca8354011f582443","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1143,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncYZAh2F3afpTbmOnGY6PVkxpJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Long Time Passing\" trailer English","key":"dsWrh2Rrn54","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-10T02:41:59.000Z","id":"662995c9c15b55011ee1921d"}]}}}
