When she was just three years old she moved to Barreiro to a \"wooden shack\" that she shared with her parents and siblings in Bairro das Palmeiras. While still a teenager, she joined the Democratic Unity Movement (MUD - Juvenil) and began her political activity that would lead her to go underground in 1962, having already joined the Portuguese Communist Party.  She was arrested by the political police (PIDE) for the first time in 1965 and was mercilessly tortured without ever having spoken out or denounced her comrades. This film, told in the first person, recounts these times in prison and the trial of her torturers after April 25, 1974.","popularity":0.0518,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conceição Matos: Coragem Hoje, Abraços Amanhã","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3136382,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paulo Guerra","original_name":"Paulo Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629609a176a940166827e9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262926,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edgar Feldman","original_name":"Edgar Feldman","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629607bcb6db50186b39c2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
