A moment of gaze upon each other tampers in a stream of emotions that flows out with different dynamics. Five strangers are gathered in the same unwelcoming space, fighting together for a way out, tired by their confused thoughts, trying to regain strength over their altered bodies. The story unfolds itself from within. The camera bursts into the heart of the dance whilst the music copes with the cruelty and the fever of every day's warfare.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Places","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4671124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simona Deaconescu","original_name":"Simona Deaconescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662816abcb6db50163afc28d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3830904","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
