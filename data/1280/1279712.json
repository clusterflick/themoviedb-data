He's French, she's Korean. Seen through his foreigner's eyes, the city is an abstract ink painting. People become a flow, river at night turns into geometric glitters. The colors of the fish market bleed on the screen. Follow this encounter with a unique character in a short Korean interview. Free from a tight narrative frame and form, it is a raw expression of a traveler's losing balance. It sits at the frontier between wet kaleidoscopic landscapes and distinguishable shapes and patterns.”","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/kjUfx5h0dKbRMRSTBNqSc1zE2Y7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sous L'Eau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1858153,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Julien Pous","original_name":"Jean-Julien Pous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629917101757f011dc50bcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophia Shek","original_name":"Sophia Shek","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6629918ac15b55011ee19131","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dahci Ma","original_name":"Dahci Ma","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662991bed5dbc2011b6a9a39","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1132,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kjUfx5h0dKbRMRSTBNqSc1zE2Y7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival du Film d'Environnement","release_date":"2010-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
