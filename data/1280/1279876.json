One day, on her way home, Fatma is stopped by the police who were checking the road. The police are looking for a militant named Şükran and they take Fatma into custody, even though they know she is not the person they are looking for. Although Fatma denies being Şükran during her interrogation at the police station, the interrogation turns into torture after a while. Fatma finally accepts that she is Şükran. When the real Şükran is caught, Fatma confronts the real Şükran, who was sent to the same prison, and denies her existence.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/6LFSUwueozss3nQxJ3PKyAj0knK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Şükran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1814041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pervin Bağdat","original_name":"Pervin Bağdat","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/poyQAkcs1aC7oQ4W9hYs6V0I6Uz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Şükran","credit_id":"662a19a9bf31f2009ae3357d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3423004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehmet Bezgin","original_name":"Mehmet Bezgin","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/2szXkO0Xh6tjZxqiiI05ceamaeG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Polis 1","credit_id":"662a19b58d77c4009b2d9ecd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Revsan Celiker","original_name":"Revsan Celiker","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"662a19bfdc864700ab5263c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deniz Sal","original_name":"Deniz Sal","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Komiser","credit_id":"662a19cc0dea6e011d7603b1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2068536,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Onur Doğan","original_name":"Onur Doğan","popularity":3.013,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662a19e8d4d50900bae1cba9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2781829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aram Dildar","original_name":"Aram Dildar","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/AfaFaZjTkPKGfYoHKIZ4ubFyVMy.jpg","credit_id":"662a1a118fdda9011edcd744","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Firat Kaya","original_name":"Firat Kaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662a19dc50f7ca00b5c87be3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576132,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dilşat Canan","original_name":"Dilşat Canan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662a1a01d18b24009cde0b83","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18930566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1488,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6LFSUwueozss3nQxJ3PKyAj0knK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
