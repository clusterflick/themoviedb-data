After a raucous introduction boogie, Hooker delivers another hit-filled set with some new additions, including the title track from his 1989 album The Healer. His bone-shaking rendition of “I’m In The Mood For Love” is the ultimate in amorous blues and is positively percolating. A new slow blues simply called “Mabel” is noteworthy, too, and Hooker gives it his plaintive and soulful all.","popularity":0.1896,"poster_path":"/4FteLLlTJ21El9mka7AtX2GGF9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Lee Hooker - Live At Montreux 1990","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lee Hooker","original_name":"John Lee Hooker","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/lz69wugVkbqqKb0p0vbXEgKhHmB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66290a84af959001316746fc","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4FteLLlTJ21El9mka7AtX2GGF9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
