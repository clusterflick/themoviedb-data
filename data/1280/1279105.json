The film is no veiled indictment of AFI, but a naked assault on the institute and its head.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Wants Her Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanton Kaye","original_name":"Stanton Kaye","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6628359e62f335017ddc9709","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
