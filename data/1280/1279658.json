Although hunting provides an important supplement to the Eskimos' income, it is now a part-time activity, and since 1975 (ten years after the start of the government's housing programme) nobody has lived all year round in hunting camps. For the older inhabitants of Pond Inlet, the old way of life is still vivid (in 1935 only 37 Eskimos lived in the village) and their reminiscences and recollections form part of a powerful statement about the present situation. These statements take the form of monologues, or comments addressed to friends and family about the effects of fifty years of contact with whites.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The People’s Land, Eskimos of Pond Inlet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gladwell","original_name":"David Gladwell","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/hZ6aUS6YBxlRMl57bGDxB9azNfM.jpg","credit_id":"66297b0a221ba601631596fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Grigsby","original_name":"Michael Grigsby","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/26K4USisT5TiM5HW4fNSuww80kn.jpg","credit_id":"662978dc344a8e0166af34b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55409,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Strasburg","original_name":"Ivan Strasburg","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66297a8ccb6db50149ae5929","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844915,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike McDuffie","original_name":"Mike McDuffie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66297acf221ba601631596f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
