Following the story of Mrs. Manjula along with many other women from Tamil Nadu, the challenges faced by millions of widows across the country are illuminated. From being ostracized to denied basic rights and economic opportunities, widows in India endure a cycle of discrimination and marginalization. “Kalangarai” meaning \"lighthouse\" in Tamil, is an organization dedicated to empowering women through initiatives such as self-help groups and educational programs. Throughout the film, \"Lighthouse\" illustrates the emotional journeys and resilience of these women, as well as the active change that Kalangarai strives to achieve. This documentary urges global awareness and support for widowed women’s rights, as the women’s struggles depict the intersectionality of gender, poverty, and social injustice.","popularity":0.1785,"poster_path":"/rnUP4Aeyf7fgmolSEKz5wIUgOBu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lighthouse","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4230160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Mei Ellis","original_name":"Lola Mei Ellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5rMx5We9H71m4R3wREGtAocpRD1.jpg","credit_id":"6629bc1e33a533009bd1a6a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4230160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Mei Ellis","original_name":"Lola Mei Ellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5rMx5We9H71m4R3wREGtAocpRD1.jpg","credit_id":"6629bc4543cd540120843cec","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4230160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Mei Ellis","original_name":"Lola Mei Ellis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5rMx5We9H71m4R3wREGtAocpRD1.jpg","credit_id":"6629bc4e0dea6e011e75d824","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dQKq3a7IHekLDgIzIh0Np6V7IND.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rnUP4Aeyf7fgmolSEKz5wIUgOBu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4129,"name":"widow"},{"id":4079,"name":"lighthouse"},{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":331715,"name":"kalangarai"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
