Levon Helm shares musical history and the influences that helped shape his signature style. Beginners learn a variety of basics: shuffles, eighth-note grooves, the rim shot, drum intros and fills, and more. Advanced drummers will appreciate his \"ghost notes,\"; how his snare triggers the bass drum (and vice versa); his \"eighth-note rubbin' the shuffle\" feel and other techniques. Levon shares his approach to drumming and singing, shows how he transforms a song with his trademark half-time feel and demonstrates the power of double drumming in a rock 'n' roll band.","popularity":0.2543,"poster_path":"/uG6dPgru0COSQ9qJbo4vaAQx6K1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Levon shares his approach to drumming and singing","title":"Levon Helm on Drums and Drumming","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levon Helm","original_name":"Levon Helm","popularity":1.2221,"profile_path":"/zc34tb129p4lBJpNaHR657tWxVv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"662c7a6e5b9508012855290a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1450,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uG6dPgru0COSQ9qJbo4vaAQx6K1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1088}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
