After a three-hour performance in front of 200,000 people at Mexico City's historic central square, the Zócalo, the ex-Beatle proved that not only is he as talented as ever, but he is as eternally charming and energetic as one would expect from the former mop-topped demigod.  McCartney amped the crowd at the Zocalo by yelling \"¡Viva Mexico, Cabrones!\" -- a sure fire way to get the crowd up onto their feet -- and made sure to pepper Mexican slang into a few of the songs performed that night. For good measure, Sir Paul also waved the Mexican flag.  During the concert, McCartney was joined by a traditional Mexican mariachi band for the Beatles' classic, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, an evening highlight that will not be forgotten anytime soon by the masses in attendance.","popularity":0.5145,"poster_path":"/6tWEjdUrUXV7G2iMIvpSjFVO8MP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4442,"logo_path":"/vXzjAeB5SP94m5qrwmx82IVzYQ9.png","name":"MPL Communications","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":200570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ocesa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Paul McCartney is ON THE RUN","title":"Paul McCartney Live at Zócalo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McCartney","original_name":"Paul McCartney","popularity":1.1874,"profile_path":"/sCPsv9ueP5UR6BkMSmRDlwbra6S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c42748ae384300e9adff4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rusty Anderson","original_name":"Rusty Anderson","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/5tVh2buRWY2pxDxWmg6XaCtEiyY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c4275f0231f200b637bb91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Ray","original_name":"Brian Ray","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/y8M4lAhATsSsT31vfOwbocTrHkV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c42767ae384300c8d37572","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Wickens","original_name":"Paul Wickens","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/oFisbVgwQKqy9fHpCUZKNY2LrSD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c42770aaec7100d62f5d56","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abraham Laboriel Jr.","original_name":"Abraham Laboriel Jr.","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/g0uoZbWAGyWmWOLRsJzSZaVbiFK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c4277baaec7100f0fbc60c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Åkerlund","original_name":"Jonas Åkerlund","popularity":0.1911,"profile_path":"/1BLBoGdU4jugE3NpSqlyNGj5xbJ.jpg","credit_id":"67b5ec769e32f72b4d88e32d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/6tWEjdUrUXV7G2iMIvpSjFVO8MP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/pkmLZ5chM3gGm4pjpoPb92KFcVN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
