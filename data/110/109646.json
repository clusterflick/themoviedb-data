Daniel is a French writer who spends his days between the novels he writes, and returns to the small town to meet Manuela, with whom he shared an sinister experience  long ago. By knowing the distant, hostile and self-destructive world of Manuela, the writer is deeply mesmerized by the dark side of his partner and try to explore its limits.

While Manuela remains trapped and tries to overcome her present, Daniel will find a way of life to the extreme and will end facing a tough test.","popularity":0.255,"poster_path":"/ul9fQDYbsfNUs8N6EEIa1Ammc2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody's Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La rosa de nadie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Leal","original_name":"Carlos Leal","popularity":0.2848,"profile_path":"/fTAQuYmGJygoUZgn1SWIA7Un7Gq.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"52fe4ac0c3a36847f81dfa7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":279256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Otero","original_name":"Ana Otero","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/3pmab9inxPUamH3BRtPtn5HC9CR.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Manuela","credit_id":"52fe4ac0c3a36847f81dfa83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ángel Amorós","original_name":"Ángel Amorós","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/ydZbnS6bf7GTaRcul2aTNkwVvmc.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Sinesio","credit_id":"52fe4ac0c3a36847f81dfa87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Manteiga","original_name":"Rosa Manteiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"","credit_id":"5b55a0710e0a2673dc015c7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amparo Valle","original_name":"Amparo Valle","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/7LGFF7Tprg2hZUNohLvGJ5GNrSc.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"","credit_id":"5b55a07cc3a3685c85014b9a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1460406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Poveda","original_name":"Marta Poveda","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/gsQvVa5uipx5YAQ8esJevlmPjsv.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"","credit_id":"5b55a0850e0a2673dc015ca9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Oliva","original_name":"Ignacio Oliva","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/5BX3Dk6xhzD3SgqfQXudmoGq62C.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac0c3a36847f81dfa7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891104,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ramón Paus","original_name":"Ramón Paus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b55a03bc3a3685c880177a7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Hilla","original_name":"Maria Hilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b55a0300e0a2673cf015701","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Oliva","original_name":"Ignacio Oliva","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/5BX3Dk6xhzD3SgqfQXudmoGq62C.jpg","credit_id":"5b55a023c3a3685c88017788","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090507,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paco Sanchez López","original_name":"Paco Sanchez López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b55a0460e0a2673ca015aec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090508,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ángel Sáenz","original_name":"Ángel Sáenz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b55a055c3a3685c820164da","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2117932","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1364,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ul9fQDYbsfNUs8N6EEIa1Ammc2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La rosa de nadie - Trailer","key":"iunQ4uHeqWQ","published_at":"2012-04-27T10:44:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e2c3a3685448008783"}]}}}
