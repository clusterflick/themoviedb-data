The man with no talent for writing marries the girl, confesses one night he didn't write the letters and ends up with a knife in his back. The writer of the letters fell in love with the woman he wrote to and wants to become her second husband even if she did murder husband number one. Singleton doesn't remember the murder or anything about the first 22 years of her life as Victoria Remington. Then at her second wedding she wonders why she said \"I take you, Roger,\" instead of \"I take you, Allen.\"","popularity":0.8423,"poster_path":"/jr4PYYbjRw16AL6pQEpKoVcTXOv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Letters","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Jones","original_name":"Jennifer Jones","popularity":0.5295,"profile_path":"/kPWuP9WGAkVnwdmT1KCif4KOMwz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Singleton","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Cotten","original_name":"Joseph Cotten","popularity":0.9238,"profile_path":"/pnfhmmCyo82lHcps42A1COobaxt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Allen Quinton","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d31","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Richards","original_name":"Ann Richards","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/cJjPMjj0NRHqdCGKTCketbq0dQD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dilly Carson","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecil Kellaway","original_name":"Cecil Kellaway","popularity":0.3162,"profile_path":"/rGVj5ODGkAxEllJt2JZTtO7doIj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mac","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d57","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Cooper","original_name":"Gladys Cooper","popularity":0.6492,"profile_path":"/sw7LjsYmwahBkMog5SLMhp2d2e4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Beatrice Remington","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d5b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Louise","original_name":"Anita Louise","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/3kPCTRG7ZLIEX5Zs9zbxFAaGPJT.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Helen Wentworth","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Sully","original_name":"Robert Sully","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/ePVlNlJLBr70dg2zpFzhucrJSVm.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Roger Morland","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d63","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Denny","original_name":"Reginald Denny","popularity":0.428,"profile_path":"/wbR5zRDwZpDqDwuoW5hSQbIptHW.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Defense Counsel Phillips","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d67","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Cossart","original_name":"Ernest Cossart","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/A3ZU9hvKmT26MdLb8VS2PxGacLo.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Bishop","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d6b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Barr","original_name":"Byron Barr","popularity":0.1652,"profile_path":"/vFA57kGxyV4xI5dS75hlaAfbaDt.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Derek Quinton","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d6f","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":97239,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Massie","original_name":"Christopher Massie","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d41","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109405,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ayn Rand","original_name":"Ayn Rand","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":"/1RI7QCAS6MwqJiy6zkwYhcgypY0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d3b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7689,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Wally Westmore","original_name":"Wally Westmore","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/udXfZgyri6PGGZoj5flmjbF6nHm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d8d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Department Head"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47077,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Roland Anderson","original_name":"Roland Anderson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac6c3a36847f81e0d75","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4123,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hal B.
