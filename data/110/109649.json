The film is constructed in the form of a voyage with main character Jacques Brassinne de La Buissière, a former high-ranking civil servant and protagonist in the political and humanitarian ‚thriller‘ that unfurled after the hasty decolonisation decision. He acts simultaneously as guide, commentator and symbolic figure, and we follow him through many crucial historical sites and symbolical moments. In the course of these peregrinations, questions arise about the manifest and hidden motivations behind the historic events of a still largely unresolved past, issues that continue to haunt past and present.","popularity":0.0697,"poster_path":"/tJVDyCqu4ACLAx8cphh788vPTow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spectres","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Espectros","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Augustijnen","original_name":"Sven Augustijnen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac0c3a36847f81dfaa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2007461","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tJVDyCqu4ACLAx8cphh788vPTow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
