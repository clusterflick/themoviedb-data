These dedicated blight warriors stop at nothing to rid their neighborhoods and cities of street art, stickers, tags, and posters. Yet several of these vigilantes have become the very menace they set out to eliminate. In their relentless attempt to stamp out graffiti, they've turned to illegally and destructively painting other people's property. VIGILANTE VIGILANTE is the story of two filmmakers who set out to expose these mysterious characters and discover a battle of expression that stretches from the streets to academia.","popularity":0.1767,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Battle for Expression","title":"Vigilante Vigilante: The Battle for Expression","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shepard Fairey","original_name":"Shepard Fairey","popularity":0.2946,"profile_path":"/6SFXfEe3mA5O1tJacgQ21WBVzbK.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4ab0c3a36847f81dc7c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano E.
