They're on the prowl for the perfect peep desperate to glimpse a \"hottie hookup,\" a \"panty party\" or a \"big booty buffet\" through unshuttered windows. But their lives are about to change.

Soon it's a battle royale for rooftop supremacy will these die-hard obsessives manage to defend their turf, or will peeping as they know it never be the same?","popularity":0.6618,"poster_path":"/rM2pg6UUrPnXm3xt5CIZjB7Vs7M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encore
