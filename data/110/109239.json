But he's passed on his craze for baseball to his son, Christie. When his dad gets fired, Chris makes friends with the former team owner's niece (and her boyfriend Pete), and not only gets his dad's job back, but a batboy position for himself. With his dad's help, Christie begins to make a few suggestions here and there. And as a publicity stunt, the team makes him their youngest manager on record. But when Chris gets sick, Coop has to come to the rescue.","popularity":1.5512,"poster_path":"/aVzdgWtBot4ofRZuMhmRLtDhPIT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Grand Picture About the Grandest Game of All -- You'll Love Every Wonderful Minute of It!","title":"The Kid from Left Field","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Dailey","original_name":"Dan Dailey","popularity":0.2371,"profile_path":"/yWpsPbxjnut4GDgQGTJMCBha06J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Larry 'Pop' Cooper","credit_id":"52fe4aaec3a36847f81dbff5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Bancroft","original_name":"Anne Bancroft","popularity":0.9689,"profile_path":"/ydabiabIsMBe2HsNmx43gBpqzxx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marian Foley","credit_id":"52fe4aaec3a36847f81dbff9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Chapin","original_name":"Billy Chapin","popularity":0.2881,"profile_path":"/yLoQrExPjkzy7YSfN7nZdwu1AM9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christie Cooper","credit_id":"52fe4aaec3a36847f81dbffd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Bridges","original_name":"Lloyd Bridges","popularity":1.0226,"profile_path":"/3dUJhLyaOl32mOU9HBpgTniLNJc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pete Haines","credit_id":"52fe4aaec3a36847f81dc001","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fess Parker","original_name":"Fess Parker","popularity":0.4318,"profile_path":"/z72Gh4aWood5nFj3S1iO3sTvAdR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"McDougal","credit_id":"52fe4aaec3a36847f81dc005","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Collins","original_name":"Ray Collins","popularity":0.4424,"profile_path":"/usQN1n6UMPwYrTuTKdiSxUj8Qwa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Fred F.
