Spurred on by the emergency and the incendiary words of a TV pundit, he reaches a boiling point and forcefully hits one of the men obstructing his ambulance. Max's strike has far-reaching, unintended consequences.","popularity":0.7076,"poster_path":"/iWx6nqF1YySSqBf5ujuOL2zcJm9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2198,"logo_path":"/tZg8STCa16jqauMgUGhKbybC5dN.png","name":"Pupkin","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":4508,"logo_path":"/sUq2S2ndKxp1B2NjbMJbSNlPI8V.png","name":"Nederlands
