Bombay Municipal Corporation's employee Kimtilal is one such person who had to pay a bribe to a gynecologist so that his wife, Shanti, can give premature birth to their son, Kamal. When Kamal grew up, Kimtilal had to pay another bribe in the form of a donation to a school for admitting him. Then he had to pay another bribe so that his son could successfully pass his college examination, and go on to join the Bombay Police Force. Finally, he withheld an important municipal license for businessman Sampat, in order to get his consent to marry his advocate daughter, Kamini, with his son.","popularity":0.4866,"poster_path":"/r59iE6145Pseeg0kXmFUEyNCPoe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1989-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kala Bazaar","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Kala Bazaar 1989","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Kala Bazaar (1989)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anil Kapoor","original_name":"Anil Kapoor","popularity":1.096,"profile_path":"/6RcrXGFzO50Tazqc8tbDlzYKvTd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vijay Girdharilal","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a36847f81dcb87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Shroff","original_name":"Jackie Shroff","popularity":0.9925,"profile_path":"/1UNJypgEyuihUW2avLLVYj76jie.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Inspector Kamal Kimtilal","credit_id":"52fe4ab1c3a36847f81dcb8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farha Naaz","original_name":"Farha Naaz","popularity":0.2753,"profile_path":"/jLJwU9mVQ3UlNFvnc0T8fDVoXAr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kamini Sampat / Kamini K.
