It was shot in Osaka Japan (Yang's hometown) and Pyongyang, North Korea,  In the 1970s, Yang's father, an ardent communist and leader of the pro-North movement in Japan, sent his three sons from Japan to North Korea under a repatriation campaign sponsored by ethnic activist organisation and de facto North Korean embassy Chongryon; as the only daughter, Yang herself remained in Japan. However, as the economic situation in the North deteriorated, the brothers became increasingly dependent for survival on the care packages sent by their parents. The film shows Yang's visits to her brothers in Pyongyang, as well as conversations with her father about his ideological faith and his regrets over breaking up his family.","popularity":0.4525,"poster_path":"/1aS0vc80WneclBX2HNGzcHT6hci.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Pyongyang","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"디어 평양","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ディア・ピョンヤン","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Yong-hi","original_name":"Yang Yong-hi","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/guAOEvvUpHBgVy9YBf81k3QWdHR.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4abfc3a36847f81df849","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206755,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masahiro Inumaru","original_name":"Masahiro Inumaru","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abfc3a36847f81df855","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206756,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Akane Nakawoo","original_name":"Akane Nakawoo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abfc3a36847f81df85b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206757,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshiya Inaba","original_name":"Toshiya Inaba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abfc3a36847f81df861","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Yong-hi","original_name":"Yang Yong-hi","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/guAOEvvUpHBgVy9YBf81k3QWdHR.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4abfc3a36847f81df867","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Yong-hi","original_name":"Yang Yong-hi","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/guAOEvvUpHBgVy9YBf81k3QWdHR.jpg","credit_id":"642009515346610113072307","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0492454","wikidata_id":"Q5246929","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8oK89SwsKlli8W6KY3gAMIQg24.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1aS0vc80WneclBX2HNGzcHT6hci.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rLHRA0QFzuLbQO6RHbPSxjkfUKP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/uRadeLP0hSxqOMKVM1XpUGeUQL5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":173577,"name":"ethnic diversity"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":261734,"name":"north korea"},{"id":270373,"name":"pyongyang, north korea"},{"id":270709,"name":"zainichi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dear Pyongyang -- Official US Trailer","key":"tPyRemiKVAE","published_at":"2008-08-08T19:53:24.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57fade23c3a3683910001f64"}]}}}
