It is known, that the whale hunting today is controversial and subject to international criticism and regulations. But the Inuit and Chukchi hunt is permitted by international law because of the whaling is the foundation of their culture and their life.\r The contemporary story of elders Aleksandr and Aleksei blends seamlessly with that of “the woman who gave birth to a whale” and other ancient myths, told here in vivid animation, in this ongoing struggle for survival and preservation of a traditional lifestyle in one of the most remote places on earth.","popularity":0.416,"poster_path":"/RmyNCZ68UYt3W3QN6OmMdTkwLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vysokiye
