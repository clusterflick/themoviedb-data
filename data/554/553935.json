In this famous production by Elijah Moshinsky for The Royal Opera, filmed in 1981, Canadian tenor Jon Vickers stars as the complex and misunderstood fisherman, with Heather Harper as Ellen Orford and Norman Bailey as Bulstrode. The conductor is Sir Colin Davis, who worked for several years with the cast of this production, resulting in a masterly interweaving of characters in this gripping drama.  Elijah MoshinskyÂ’s production for The Royal Opera was inspired by early Victorian photographs taken of the Suffolk coast and presents his action on a sparse stage, evocatively lit and dominated by strong performances. Canadian tenor Jon Vickers is one of the greatest Grimes of all. This is a towering performance, rough and terrifying, yet beautifully sung in the lyrical passages.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/bH9LLFr6EOhzJjZcZbBqmu2dwS0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Grimes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Vickers","original_name":"Jon Vickers","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/kAvC40omRqJSfAKXvRhUAalwhqp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc347ab92514179bc04185d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Harper","original_name":"Heather Harper","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc347b5c3a3682d4b04ad1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Bailey","original_name":"Norman Bailey","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc347bf92514179bc04187a","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bH9LLFr6EOhzJjZcZbBqmu2dwS0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
