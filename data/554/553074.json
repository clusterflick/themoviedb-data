When the church's Elder Board becomes aware of the situation, he's asked to take two weeks off to consider his actions and the impact on his role in ministry. Distraught by the arrival of this news via email, Cleo grabs a backpack and bike to hit the road and figure out what's really true. His journey takes a turn toward Edmond, Oklahoma, when he hitches a ride from a mysterious traveler named Larry and his dead father. Larry's intense skepticism along with a string of peculiar signs causes Cleo to question more than his relationship with the teen...he questions the very existence of Love.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/vTqrqwn533QeteFyUt1DaMR8o3B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to Edmond","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathanael Welch","original_name":"Nathanael Welch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cleo","credit_id":"5f7fa27f2f3b170035f4b5bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tripp Fuller","original_name":"Tripp Fuller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"5f7fa28c2f3b170037f3d074","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Baker","original_name":"Ellen Baker","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"5f7fa29762e86f0036dd8d3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Daskol","original_name":"Patrick Daskol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Father of the Bride","credit_id":"5f7fa2a062e86f0037dd88c4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis C.
