Baroque and carnivalesque, Eliogabalo is not, however, an opera that advocates a return to order. Leonardo García Alarcón, a finder of baroque gems, and Thomas Jolly are careful not to transform Eliogabalo into a sublime icon who would abase virtue. On the contrary, the conductor and young director, who are presenting their first production for the Paris Opera, accept the character’s contradictions and ambiguities","popularity":0.1858,"poster_path":"/yAMrFI5zRY1lnQdeSwlCcZdp2kv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Francesco Cavalli's opera live at the Palais Garnier, Paris on September 14, 2016","title":"Cavalli: Eliogabalo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Fagioli","original_name":"Franco Fagioli","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/YBuTjY4XN87AIaaabVfk76NBqs.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Eliogabalo","credit_id":"5bbff46c0e0a266e5d00c81c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":269140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Groves","original_name":"Paul Groves","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alessandro Cesare","credit_id":"5bbff47b92514179c700bfdc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Sierra","original_name":"Nadine Sierra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ekwYV61wshIQqlcaaGg6ZL5zEMK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Flavia Gemmira","credit_id":"5bbff49292514179bc00ad8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonardo García Alarcón","original_name":"Leonardo García Alarcón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bc232c40e0a266e57036925","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4793670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Jolly","original_name":"Thomas Jolly","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wwHL96vluWAUTWovRLieE9xOeMt.jpg","credit_id":"66a299d5e225e242da14de2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonardo García Alarcón","original_name":"Leonardo García Alarcón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbff51892514179ca00b540","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francesco Cavalli","original_name":"Francesco Cavalli","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jAo6NSZSleJm76mpdHoCW9KwYpw.jpg","credit_id":"5bc07e5992514179c101431c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gEdp0Xaqt5ATlPnoRdt9NpnH0Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":878,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yAMrFI5zRY1lnQdeSwlCcZdp2kv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":222143,"name":"opera baroque"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
