Invariably embroiled in conspiracies, intrigues and quarrels, Cellini is commissioned by the Pope to cast a large sculpture of Perseus. He is loved by Teresa, but she is promised to Fieramosca, an academic artist who has not been favoured with a papal commission. Terry Gilliam’s exuberant production draws the protagonists into a delirious and joyful yet claustrophobic and megalomaniac world: a flaring up of contagious madness.","popularity":0.3698,"poster_path":"/2Laj3irQXmd2tG7CgfdMA7lzGqY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72108,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Nederlandse Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":65595,"logo_path":null,"name":"ENO: English National Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hector Berlioz's opera semiseria live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on April 12th, 2018","title":"Benvenuto Cellini","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Osborn","original_name":"John Osborn","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/3fujch9Z6mke6VjqGXILhfPSIbm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Benvenuto Cellini","credit_id":"5bc0939792514179bc0150dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pretty Yende","original_name":"Pretty Yende","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"5bc093a692514179bc0150e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Losier","original_name":"Michèle Losier","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/gxshJndUkEHCkb4r6a23PcWvn4F.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ascanio","credit_id":"5bc093b392514179bc0150f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audun Iversen","original_name":"Audun Iversen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uCtJDK83nAqN4FL7jHG5VlrPBrW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Fieramosca","credit_id":"5bc093c792514179b6016af0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Spotti","original_name":"Marco Spotti","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/qpQDUTWmmR1QUkRRZnIAr78HmDy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Le Pape Clément VII","credit_id":"5bc093d892514179b6016b07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jordan","original_name":"Philippe Jordan","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/sSPyOAw49EgfxKeoD9ziM89HA1j.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5bc2309b92514179c4031655","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Gilliam","original_name":"Terry Gilliam","popularity":0.7405,"profile_path":"/7qBkaXxANmnb6hqQCBc4iWqXEL6.jpg","credit_id":"64da97d1bf31f201cd50bdf8","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hector Berlioz","original_name":"Hector Berlioz","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/uXu4EJxHhOkz8NqtnBAAwx8CLLG.jpg","credit_id":"5bc09330c3a3682d440191e6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Léon de Wailly","original_name":"Léon de Wailly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc0933cc3a3682d6001826d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681220,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henri Auguste Barbier","original_name":"Henri Auguste Barbier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc093460e0a266e540171fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bCQJUAHCXrb1YrXHm60vkXvOIAF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Laj3irQXmd2tG7CgfdMA7lzGqY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
