Paul Joyce, who directed it, has also made documentaries about Nicolas Roeg, David Cronenberg, Nagisa Oshima, and Dennis Hopper, and he knows the conventional format well enough to get the most out of it. There are good clips and interesting commentaries from the interviewed subjects, who include Wenders himself, cinematographer Robby Muller, filmmaker Sam Fuller, novelist Patricia Highsmith, musician Ry Cooder, actors Harry Dean Stanton, Peter Falk, and Hanns Zischler, and critic Kraft Wetzel, who is especially provocative. A must-see for Wenders fans, highly recommended for everyone else. –Jonathan Rosenbaum, 1989","popularity":1.1085,"poster_path":"/igwuezRFsh3TpEyldcfBQQ9X60x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motion and Emotion: The Films of Wim Wenders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Falk","original_name":"Peter Falk","popularity":2.4758,"profile_path":"/e59x8ITouNlyz8Qa2abb5lxiQvI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc1b38492514179ba02b08d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Hopper","original_name":"Dennis Hopper","popularity":1.2061,"profile_path":"/kqyNvLHi5RZGZcZMxl7e6XvoB5U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc1b38cc3a3682d4402ed37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Dean Stanton","original_name":"Harry Dean Stanton","popularity":1.4043,"profile_path":"/197UiLVdxPOv8196sqmUpJzOQB5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc1b3930e0a266e5b02c349","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Wenders","original_name":"Wim Wenders","popularity":1.0062,"profile_path":"/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc1b39a92514179ae02a613","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ry Cooder","original_name":"Ry Cooder","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":"/bHxTP9V9s67uveh651EvWl7He77.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbf402a0c271000412f5b95","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Fuller","original_name":"Samuel Fuller","popularity":0.2816,"profile_path":"/yC1rWSkV8crevItmlRz056GOTMf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbf4031a3d0270040bd8b77","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patricia Highsmith","original_name":"Patricia Highsmith","popularity":0.1803,"profile_path":"/450t1CrYhaEFPz5uPwgEaPEYvPB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbf403735c30a004158c824","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robby Müller","original_name":"Robby Müller","popularity":0.2708,"profile_path":"/1YeDTwdFQNxM6hDADl0bKfuX7Fx.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbf403e9f51af003de6d25d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kraft Wetzel","original_name":"Kraft Wetzel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbf4048a3d0270042bd97a3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanns Zischler","original_name":"Hanns Zischler","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/5O4Dum1OuKI4RMB24xjACkL22iA.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fbf404f3344c60040c216d2","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Joyce","original_name":"Paul Joyce","popularity":0.1753,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc1b3e10e0a266e5b02c37f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139634,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ken Morse","original_name":"Ken Morse","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf3e800c271000402fc3e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12685,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tony Lawson","original_name":"Tony Lawson","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf3e920c2710003e301297","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Rodley","original_name":"Chris Rodley","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/68s5Da7VJ8vcoUG3b4WWyq1jRDP.jpg","credit_id":"5fbf3e79271ca5004155dcf9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0100193","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/igwuezRFsh3TpEyldcfBQQ9X60x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
