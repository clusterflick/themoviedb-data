But it was in the Pacific Northwest, where she witnessed the 1916 Everett massacre and chronicled the 1919 Seattle General Strike, that her political vision took shape. In Moscow she helped found the first English language newspaper, in Spain her many visits resulted in her book, Spain in Arms; and in China she interviewed Mao in a Yan'an cave in 1946. She is buried in Beijing in a special cemetery for martyrs of the revolution.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":"/cAvK79sOn5VQ0fvay8rHCh9hB2d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stourwater Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witness to Revolution: The Story of Anna Louise Strong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486099,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucy Ostrander","original_name":"Lucy Ostrander","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc2fd650e0a266e5904211a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Gargiulo","original_name":"Maria Gargiulo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc2fd8392514179ba0408b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Sellers","original_name":"Don Sellers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc2fdbf0e0a266e5904214b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2042716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cAvK79sOn5VQ0fvay8rHCh9hB2d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3wJ6rvUpoG1LIlrzgLnEdOfhJVd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
