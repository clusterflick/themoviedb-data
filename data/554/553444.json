Hoffmann, with a sprinkling of Goethe’s Faust, portrays the German poet as both narrator and hero recounting his love affairs with Olympia, Antonia and Giuletta. Robert Carsen’s spectacular production highlights the melancholy genius of a man marked by life, with a coherence and dramatic sense remarkable for a work that leaves numerous questions unanswered. Under the baton of Philippe Jordan, Stéphanie d’Oustrac, Ermonela Jaho, Kate Aldrich, Yann Beuron and Ramón Vargas and Stefano Secco in the main role, interpret the legendary airs of this work whose brilliant mystery will continue to dazzle opera houses for countless years to come.","popularity":0.2008,"poster_path":"/k1CcWaHJADVcHBpG7k4tlvdRGYJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jacques Offenbach's opéra fantastique live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on November 15, 2016","title":"Offenbach: The Tales of Hoffmann","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Vargas","original_name":"Ramón Vargas","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/oPUpcdxxlLU8ZPWbuzdMbzpjmzM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Hoffmann","credit_id":"5bbff7f092514179ba00bf2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Koutcher","original_name":"Nadine Koutcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cC1b3KUZ1dQKOm6uxrCueUyzgx5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Olympia","credit_id":"5bbff7fcc3a3682d4700e00b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1199136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Aldrich","original_name":"Kate Aldrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xuQkgRlqAOjBM9nHEca6xsKjnDp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giulietta","credit_id":"5bbff81292514179bc00b07f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermonela Jaho","original_name":"Ermonela Jaho","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/5cXV7EMRi2AUwMNM4KiBuwDib7m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Antonia","credit_id":"5bbff82592514179ba00bf65","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jordan","original_name":"Philippe Jordan","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/sSPyOAw49EgfxKeoD9ziM89HA1j.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5bc2317bc3a3682d53030718","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Carsen","original_name":"Robert Carsen","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/ffsRQfAAVpOPuzHChuZjEbBcefJ.jpg","credit_id":"5bbff87b92514179c700c386","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Barbier","original_name":"Jules Barbier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zhVqhaYv2vyzWFHZCuno5iDZPHz.jpg","credit_id":"5bbff85dc3a3682d5b00c309","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Offenbach","original_name":"Jacques Offenbach","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/iVnjK1OhWwrkptwNCgPfZTDTyyi.jpg","credit_id":"5bc07dcf92514179c401460f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/koOWdD09Kj0riA6DaMDcfv5ACfI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k1CcWaHJADVcHBpG7k4tlvdRGYJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":230647,"name":"opera buffa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les Contes d'Hoffmann - Les oiseaux dans la charmille (air d'Olympia)","key":"0fVgERIrM6Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","published_at":"2016-11-07T14:07:14.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c59d1ebc3a36805e8894a90"}]}}}
