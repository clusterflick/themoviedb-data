With Albanian fans not permitted to attend the game due to purported safety concerns, the stadium full of Serbian fans echoed racist chants and death threats. Tensions rose to a boil when a drone carrying an Albanian flag flew above the players and onto the field. Angered fans rushed the field, attacking the Albanian players, forcing the match to end. A history of political tensions, war, and sport is explored as we follow the journey of the Albanian national team on their first appearance in a major tournament.","popularity":0.1263,"poster_path":"/3Ow8xUC29OEHpIXafRx4jtgmHU3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134886,"logo_path":"/um4ikHzAMsKVU1Xn2E9HNFCVVs7.png","name":"Top Neck Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"},{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triumph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorik Cana","original_name":"Lorik Cana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cbf5dc10e0a2660dcf407bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni De Biasi","original_name":"Gianni De Biasi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cbf5dd8925141097dfb6a1f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shkëlzen Gashi","original_name":"Shkëlzen Gashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cbf5de80e0a2654e9f124e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Tramezzani","original_name":"Paolo Tramezzani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cbf5df5925141097dfb6a37","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2295442,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kreshnik Jonuzi, Luftar Von Rama","original_name":"Kreshnik Jonuzi, Luftar Von Rama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbf5e4cc3a368596a817ef5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charlie Askew","original_name":"Charlie Askew","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbf5e629251417d39fbc4ed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334828,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aldo Shllaku","original_name":"Aldo Shllaku","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbf5f6d0e0a261a55f58386","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charlie Askew","original_name":"Charlie Askew","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df53cbd26dac100125008cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4361362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kreshnik Jonuzi","original_name":"Kreshnik Jonuzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fc77502a74dc73f955d17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545105,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luftar Von Rama","original_name":"Luftar Von Rama","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fc77e02a74dc73f955d1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5215010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Ow8xUC29OEHpIXafRx4jtgmHU3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":662}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
