An ambivalent character, both regal in bearing and warmly protective, cruel and yet loving, rapacious and indomitable even in the face of madness, this ’Machiavelli among miscreants’ destined to become chief of police, uses his conquests to advance relentlessly in the pursuit of his aims whilst keeping his hand closely hidden. Guy Cassiers, working for the first time with the Paris Opera, portrays a three-tiered society where some rise and others fall.","popularity":0.1703,"poster_path":"/93HmhQoknL2Zezob9En31IHktsG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"World premiere of Luca Francesconi's creation live at the Palais Garnier, Paris on March 13, 2017","title":"Francesconi: Trompe-la-Mort","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Naouri","original_name":"Laurent Naouri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/o2sx13HsVagwyF5fpkOYmrNBnDu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Vautrin / Trompe-la-mort / Jacques Collin","credit_id":"5bc082e392514179ca0143e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1755306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Fuchs","original_name":"Julie Fuchs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/32KiHf2k0MXWtMXTdBJXpvSmfri.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Esther","credit_id":"5bc082ee92514179c701592b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyrille Dubois","original_name":"Cyrille Dubois","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bnQcnJgVUlEX9qpjYn6gVFuvEmL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lucien de Rubempré","credit_id":"5bc082fd0e0a266e54015b0c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Labonnette","original_name":"Marc Labonnette","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Le Baron de Nucingen","credit_id":"5bc08312c3a3682d53013a43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildikó Komlósi","original_name":"Ildikó Komlósi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Asie","credit_id":"5bc08320c3a3682d60016d79","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Talbot","original_name":"Philippe Talbot","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eugène de Rastignac","credit_id":"5bc083330e0a266e6401684b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Susanna Mälkki","original_name":"Susanna Mälkki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bc2324592514179b6032ad3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148253,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luca Francesconi","original_name":"Luca Francesconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc08346c3a3682d59014c24","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148253,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luca Francesconi","original_name":"Luca Francesconi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc0834cc3a3682d4e014795","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Honoré de Balzac","original_name":"Honoré de Balzac","popularity":0.267,"profile_path":"/40WbN9E3AnfBSjiN8Ip85eb6L0I.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0835792514179ca01446a","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Susanna Mälkki","original_name":"Susanna Mälkki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc083620e0a266e5d01636f","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Cassiers","original_name":"Guy Cassiers","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/4kPvS1iSFvkSzlBFmFn5aeAaq43.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0836f0e0a266e54015c9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFfWbc7Sityv7nkNwUhob0z8ZUH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/93HmhQoknL2Zezob9En31IHktsG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
