Contagious savagery, cruelty and brutality are exacerbated by the confines of the prison. However, within its concrete walls emerge both tenderness and cruelty at the sight of an injured bird; a multitude of stories and highly personal monologues. With this production, first performed at the Wiener Festwochen in 2007, the Paris Opera pays tribute to Patrice Chéreau.","popularity":0.3482,"poster_path":"/kMEjGZByXN8gTfjN6IAyYWNDadn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Leos Janáček’s opera live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on November 15th, 2017","title":"From the House of the Dead","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willard White","original_name":"Willard White","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/bsq1Sw3uJJUmKXa34LEtLi0kEIC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alexandre Petrovitch Goriantchikov","credit_id":"5bc08d3a0e0a266e5b016183","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Stoklossa","original_name":"Eric Stoklossa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alieïa","credit_id":"5bc08d4bc3a3682d59015a55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Štefan Margita","original_name":"Štefan Margita","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/8PDil6kkRj3t6soo4NxFUYHibUs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Filka Morosov","credit_id":"5bc08daa92514179ca01536e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ladislav Elgr","original_name":"Ladislav Elgr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Skuratov","credit_id":"5bc08dcec3a3682d59015b00","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Mattei","original_name":"Peter Mattei","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/f2JpqPiMjArGx0QOju4IPHbmUPV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Šiškov","credit_id":"5bc08de292514179ca0153b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esa-Pekka Salonen","original_name":"Esa-Pekka Salonen","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/eVA3KfJXGuM46MVAM0ckmgbyssr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5bc230f8c3a3682d4e0307e4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933781,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leoš Janáček","original_name":"Leoš Janáček","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mEwBgc6J7hncEsIiwKP2OpH45yK.jpg","credit_id":"5bc08ceac3a3682d4b018ac6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","original_name":"Фёдор Достоевский","popularity":0.5795,"profile_path":"/hMm3y5n60KNvLB5F14oCfo8imSK.jpg","credit_id":"5bc08cfe0e0a266e5d0172c6","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933781,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leoš Janáček","original_name":"Leoš Janáček","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mEwBgc6J7hncEsIiwKP2OpH45yK.jpg","credit_id":"5bc08d08c3a3682d590159ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pQJ4f6flhIUoDKUnZPwHtRlKe2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMEjGZByXN8gTfjN6IAyYWNDadn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
