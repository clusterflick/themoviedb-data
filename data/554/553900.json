Since its founding in 1919, the CPUSA has championed the struggles for democracy, labor rights, womenâ€™s equality, and racial justice. During its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, it attracted millions of Americans to support its causes and almost 100,000 men and women to enlist in its ranks. The film begins with the Party's emergence as a small militant sect in the 1920s and documents its rise to the foremost radical group in the United States during the Great Depression, fighting against racism, sexism and fascism, as well as for the rights of workers to organize. It ends with the decline of the Party during the Cold War under the assaults of the FBI and anti- communist crusades.","popularity":0.728,"poster_path":"/gZSlqWHuxYF1EY8HeaSyjysxFto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26277,"logo_path":"/uXqiWcZbtSG2G9cQ031fRl2V0gH.png","name":"American Public Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24982,"logo_path":"/7QEPsLccAEMQBksE9bgJSycH6A.png","name":"Twin Cities Public Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Reds: The Failed Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne June","original_name":"Wayne June","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5bc309d792514179b6040bb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2149806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Hall","original_name":"Gus Hall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/paJcYRuemZNTbm5I66oa3XgMazV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self/Archive Footage","credit_id":"5bc309f8c3a3682d4e03eedd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Green","original_name":"Gil Green","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc30a22c3a3682d6004568d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Winston","original_name":"Henry Winston","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc30a4492514179ae042f08","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Aptheker","original_name":"Bettina Aptheker","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc30a590e0a266e59042e0f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Darcy","original_name":"Sam Darcy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc30a6d0e0a266e5b044c47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Schrank","original_name":"Robert Schrank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc30a870e0a266e5d044474","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Wormser","original_name":"Richard Wormser","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d5b1f01757f00dfe3109b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Wormser","original_name":"Richard Wormser","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d5b2601757f00fce642c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Wormser","original_name":"Richard Wormser","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d5b1afe63180086f9e2fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Jersey","original_name":"Bill Jersey","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc309b70e0a266e5b044bb6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5533118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gZSlqWHuxYF1EY8HeaSyjysxFto.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":195241,"name":"radical politics"},{"id":230255,"name":"fall of communism"},{"id":239548,"name":"left politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
