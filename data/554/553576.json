We began this project by meeting with women from all different backgrounds, ages, and walks of life. The level of sincerity, depth, and trust that is cultivated in this documentary is nothing short of impressive. Each woman has been involved with the Lenox Hill Women's Shelter in New York city. As the project moves forward we meet Charlotte a 13 year old girl who's story is depicted through visual images. She never speaks. Charlotte's image is a metaphor of innocence that ties all the women's unique stories together.","popularity":0.1556,"poster_path":"/uyDfdg96lonRc74DwznR9VHhLV3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosso Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Cannot Speak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2150549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Cinnamon","original_name":"Holly Cinnamon","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/5Wz4YgQ2YHOfLXzGv7LjPLGHnsS.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"5bc3fb5392514179ca05078e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2150551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Pellegrini","original_name":"Laura Pellegrini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb01aad556970162a8d07b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1536144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Da Fre","original_name":"Stefano Da Fre","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/r9thm5oOZjA0CtcKrE0MMHHLXAn.jpg","credit_id":"5bc3fc91c3a3682d5304f228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7785026","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6sn4tx8SBVQceKapsRzLxjJZjKk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uyDfdg96lonRc74DwznR9VHhLV3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Girl Who Cannot Speak Trailer 2019","key":"318849344","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-21T19:22:48.000Z","id":"65bb0289c144dd017cfe02a2"}]}}}
