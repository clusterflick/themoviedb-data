It follows the period of transition of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into today's Serbia and Mihajlo's transition from a child into a middle aged man. It is a film made by a man who is about to leave his country for good and about the contents of his immigrant's suitcase. Story about one country and four passports, a farewell that was in the making for 25 years. Combining the present-day footage, his family's Super 8 home videos and animation, Mihajlo reflects on growing up in a society that has been falling apart.","popularity":0.1054,"poster_path":"/555FONYHxrGy2GDGfES1ZV3eVrr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fade In","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":110093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film the World","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":82871,"logo_path":"/kQ3bbwVPehXN3M1c64ClJMTuNPr.png","name":"Filmski centar Srbije","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":239699,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien (BKM)","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":94128,"logo_path":"/2omVaLOZ0fHG1jSmQbmbsqTkzWI.png","name":"Hrvatski Audiovizualni Centar","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":239583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parabellum Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2016-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Passports","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mihajlo Jevtić","original_name":"Mihajlo Jevtić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc2b043c3a3682d5b03fee0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mihajlo Jevtić","original_name":"Mihajlo Jevtić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc2b01892514179c403a811","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mihajlo Jevtić","original_name":"Mihajlo Jevtić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc2b01d92514179ae03de9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5903674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/555FONYHxrGy2GDGfES1ZV3eVrr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
