Lucia, a magnificent flower shattered by the violence of a society of men, is embodied by South Africa’s Pretty Yende, a rising star of the opera stage, in this production by Andrei Serban, conducted by Riccardo Frizza.","popularity":0.1615,"poster_path":"/1OcN0J4JnuKGfVLdER264AAHjaG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gaetano Donizetti's opera seria live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on October 14th, 2016","title":"Donizetti: Lucia di Lammermoor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pretty Yende","original_name":"Pretty Yende","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"5bc09c7f92514179ba01769b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piero Pretti","original_name":"Piero Pretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Edgardo di Ravenswood","credit_id":"5bc09c8f0e0a266e5d018782","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleksiy Palchykov","original_name":"Oleksiy Palchykov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Arturo Bucklaw","credit_id":"5bc09ca00e0a266e5b01746a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafal Siwek","original_name":"Rafal Siwek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/kvPuRCnrjJHb00cNPo1oM57E2W3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Raimondo Bidebent","credit_id":"5bc09cb70e0a266e5b01747d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568209,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Frizza","original_name":"Riccardo Frizza","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bc232b392514179c4031a6f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5bc09c31c3a3682d5b018380","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382767,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salvadore Cammarano","original_name":"Salvadore Cammarano","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc09c3bc3a3682d4b01a358","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94781,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Scott","original_name":"Walter Scott","popularity":0.1807,"profile_path":"/xk03hvrRLIjoWaL8BsSkU5krZ0F.jpg","credit_id":"5bc09c4b92514179c101690e","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568209,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Frizza","original_name":"Riccardo Frizza","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc09c550e0a266e5701898c","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Serban","original_name":"Andrei Serban","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/36lFrORxjweJ4PCLCDb6gIUo56F.jpg","credit_id":"5bc09c6892514179c70179be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jc19WvAKomvnp4IwvZ56bYwJX3W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1OcN0J4JnuKGfVLdER264AAHjaG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
