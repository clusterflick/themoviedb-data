However, the latter’s fidelity is not unfailing and Wozzeck is haunted by torment. His officers and comrades in arms do little to improve the situation. The omnipresent tension in this profoundly romantic work unifies the fifteen scenes with their complex tonalities alternating between Verist notes and the force of ritualised actions. Christoph Marthaler’s production provides an atmosphere of contemporaneity strongly accentuated by the choice of a single set, where the men’s despair is submerged in Berg’s dearly sought-after sobriety.","popularity":0.0996,"poster_path":"/2Wc27K5UZ5HQrq1CkiU0HwbeTKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Alban Berg's first opera live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on April 24th, 2017","title":"Berg: Wozzeck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Martin Kränzle","original_name":"Johannes Martin Kränzle","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/sNrlxw0VTNxozsshL1lIjVrJRec.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wozzeck","credit_id":"5bc08721c3a3682d53013fe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Štefan Margita","original_name":"Štefan Margita","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/8PDil6kkRj3t6soo4NxFUYHibUs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tambour-Major","credit_id":"5bc08735c3a3682d53013ffc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gun-Brit Barkmin","original_name":"Gun-Brit Barkmin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"5bc0876a0e0a266e5d016af8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Timoshenko","original_name":"Mikhail Timoshenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Erster Handwerksbursch","credit_id":"5bc087be0e0a266e68017254","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315883,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Schønwandt","original_name":"Michael Schønwandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bc232200e0a266e590346cc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georg Büchner","original_name":"Georg Büchner","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/7VPRXJZwALYPuEcwb8H6c7GLfTF.jpg","credit_id":"5bc086ef0e0a266e5b01589e","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110453,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alban Berg","original_name":"Alban Berg","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yumFeNQ8CwVu9qSL9JezxbFmcyU.jpg","credit_id":"5bc086e392514179ca0148a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110453,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alban Berg","original_name":"Alban Berg","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yumFeNQ8CwVu9qSL9JezxbFmcyU.jpg","credit_id":"5bc086dcc3a3682d5b0165ed","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315883,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Schønwandt","original_name":"Michael Schønwandt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc087030e0a266e6b016971","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Marthaler","original_name":"Christoph Marthaler","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc0871192514179ca0148fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mBlkQuLqdyQ1el0CnFSaNcnDbhh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.688,"height":1745,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Wc27K5UZ5HQrq1CkiU0HwbeTKE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
