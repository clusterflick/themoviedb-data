Jephthah, destined to become their saviour, has grown up in the desert until becoming a powerful military leader. On leaving for battle, he swears to the god Jehovah that he will sacrifice the first person he meets on his way home. Alas, as he returns victorious, it is Iphis, his only daughter, who comes to meet him… Claus Guth directs this oratorio in which grief‑stricken voices interweave as they confront an apocalyptic situation.","popularity":0.1103,"poster_path":"/ddOIycA3n5K2vnb1wBZfdbMzv7X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"George Frideric Handel's oratorio live at the Palais Garnier, Paris on January 13th, 2018","title":"Handel: Jephtha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Bostridge","original_name":"Ian Bostridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jephtha","credit_id":"5bc091b7c3a3682d47019e5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Nicole Lemieux","original_name":"Marie-Nicole Lemieux","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/z2pBMRwfJ9ww7SpolJxaFkjn8oK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Storgé","credit_id":"5bc091ca0e0a266e5d0178ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Sly","original_name":"Philippe Sly","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Zebul","credit_id":"5bc091dac3a3682d53014cf7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valer Barna-Sabadus","original_name":"Valer Barna-Sabadus","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/gHblMQvBBV8oEFqGowVEDcSWrbz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"5bc091e492514179bc014f1c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Christie","original_name":"William Christie","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bc230b292514179b603291a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","original_name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/7vbMm0VcHE0vTlaU9BTLqILenM0.jpg","credit_id":"5bc0917e0e0a266e64017ceb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571550,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Morell","original_name":"Thomas Morell","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc0918dc3a3682d4e015b09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570613,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Christie","original_name":"William Christie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc091a0c3a3682d60018042","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Guth","original_name":"Claus Guth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc091abc3a3682d4e015b22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/up0cPc5WdTUFGpyJi2GtHiRbRmB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":876,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ddOIycA3n5K2vnb1wBZfdbMzv7X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
