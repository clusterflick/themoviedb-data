Photographed in high temperature 'K' light, the images are presented as a staccato animation, a feverishly ticking meter for a narrative told by a self-proclaimed ‘troupe of professional mourners.’ Price similarly revisits a series of photographs taken from hosiery packaging, featuring young women in highly expressive, stylized poses of fear, dread or despair. They are pictured shielding their eyes; apparently from the camera and/or the sun. In K, these women become the film’s central protagonists.","popularity":0.0518,"poster_path":"/7ylRABBzZ1BjgRcpuoL9zCmi6jV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Price","original_name":"Elizabeth Price","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/y2d6aGKMsJtsYxpk10RSo5PT2h.jpg","credit_id":"5bbe89aec3a3682b46002763","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Price","original_name":"Elizabeth Price","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/y2d6aGKMsJtsYxpk10RSo5PT2h.jpg","credit_id":"5bbe89a99251413d60002a1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1398,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ylRABBzZ1BjgRcpuoL9zCmi6jV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":786}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Basel","release_date":"2015-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
