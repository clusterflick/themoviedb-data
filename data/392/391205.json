Inevitably, Bret and Margie quarrel and break up, only to be reunited by their efforts to snag \"banana king\" Gomez (Mischa Auer) for a lucrative radio contract. The old 1920s tune \"Margie\" is heard throughout the proceedings, frequently fitted out with ludicrous new lyrics (\"Bananas! We're Always Thikin' of Bananas!\" etc.) by a zany songwriting team (Eddie Quillan and Wally Vernon).","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/wujOeywKiLZmFIrkEEcMtJAfUTA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Brown","original_name":"Tom Brown","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/ehCgDrUhMQA7gBL7fm7kBoK8jQO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bret","credit_id":"5701a4e5c3a36856ab000bc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan Grey","original_name":"Nan Grey","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":"/wsmYXBNPsl2LDTetc1qHiXENgM0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Margie","credit_id":"5701a4f1c3a3685694000c9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mischa Auer","original_name":"Mischa Auer","popularity":0.2779,"profile_path":"/7mCfBcUq6FedSlD9lT6AWR3bIou.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gomez","credit_id":"5701a4fcc3a368568c000cd6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joy Hodges","original_name":"Joy Hodges","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":"/hl8bxWlNbQCwSO5aCR1F4boJMSZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"5701a507c3a368568c000cd8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Chauncey","credit_id":"5701a514c3a368568c000cdb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Jenkins","original_name":"Allen Jenkins","popularity":0.217,"profile_path":"/5Sx6PnCGo2NIDYqWwP3P2BCejqd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Kenneth","credit_id":"5701a51fc3a368568c000cdf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1011249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otis Garrett","original_name":"Otis Garrett","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701a4a0925141607a000c26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119534,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Gerard Smith","original_name":"Paul Gerard Smith","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701a4aa9251416074000d87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":30127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Scott Darling","original_name":"Scott Darling","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701a4c492514114b900066b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":30127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Scott Darling","original_name":"Scott Darling","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701a4c8925141607f000b8c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242817,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erna Lazarus","original_name":"Erna Lazarus","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701a4d2c3a3685690000be5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242817,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erna Lazarus","original_name":"Erna Lazarus","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5701a4d6925141307a000339","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0032759","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wujOeywKiLZmFIrkEEcMtJAfUTA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3658,"name":"career"},{"id":33494,"name":"couple"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1940-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
