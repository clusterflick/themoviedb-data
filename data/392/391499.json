At the center stands a suit of tactical counter-surveillance armor embedded with body cameras that offers a simple question: If the police wear body armor to protect themselves while in public, what must ‘The Public’ wear to protect themselves from the police? Video projections surround the suit featuring former officers, activists, and family members directly impacted by police violence. In turn, creating a space for a real conversation on police violence—one that our country desperately needs. This project is urgent and powerful and created by an incredible group of artists and activists.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Argus Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
