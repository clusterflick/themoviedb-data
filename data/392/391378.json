They play the lead act at a popular nightclub. The trouble begins when they hire a few students from a financially foundering dance school for their newest production. One of the dancers, a rich young socialite, desperately wants to be in it too, but her prurient maiden aunts refuse to allow her to disgrace their family by becoming a common chorine. She and the club owner (who must have the aunt's permission because the girl is underage) try to convince them, but it's not easy.","popularity":0.9252,"poster_path":"/g0TqoiJRz3pLSGDT9qdJxZUaueh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"AMERICA'S TOP TRIO - dish out the jive!","title":"Give Out, Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laverne Andrews","original_name":"Laverne Andrews","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/zLIHdZO1wvLat7plMjLEy8TAO92.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Laverne Andrews","credit_id":"5702e6d0c3a36806de00023c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1578527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patty Andrews","original_name":"Patty Andrews","popularity":0.1891,"profile_path":"/23UXdG3XZtspSo5Q9rEv1hWViG2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Patty","credit_id":"5702e6db9251416ca90001d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxene Andrews","original_name":"Maxene Andrews","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/ttODwiMMz5UMkG3zM36G9xi4I0S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Maxene Andrews","credit_id":"5702e6e99251416caf000207","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace McDonald","original_name":"Grace McDonald","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/t22ekuGBC6BSqSqRq7VYZ1nPBul.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gracie Waverly","credit_id":"5702e6f6c3a36806d60001d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Dailey","original_name":"Dan Dailey","popularity":0.2371,"profile_path":"/yWpsPbxjnut4GDgQGTJMCBha06J.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bob Edwards (as Dan Dailey Jr.)","credit_id":"5702e702c3a36806dc00021c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Butterworth","original_name":"Charles Butterworth","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/gf1IZXYGi1Q0ma5LIs3204m1K66.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Prof. Woof","credit_id":"5702e710c3a36806dc00021e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Catlett","original_name":"Walter Catlett","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/c5ldUlcqrUuxpQE9iXqj9GlRZwt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Gribble","credit_id":"5702e71bc3a36806e400023b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Frawley","original_name":"William Frawley","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/mPCnAsN2GbBoLl34nrviZ4aCCe1.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Harrison","credit_id":"5702e7269251417ce0000073","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald O'Connor","original_name":"Donald O'Connor","popularity":0.5852,"profile_path":"/sV7Dx16wcajPsxJItmW5dX4axoW.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Don","credit_id":"5702e72f9251417ce0000075","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":196198,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Warren Wilson","original_name":"Warren Wilson","popularity":0.1634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5702e6b29251416caf000202","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Sands","original_name":"Lee Sands","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5702e6bb9251416ca30001e8","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119534,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Gerard Smith","original_name":"Paul Gerard Smith","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5702e6a99251416caf0001ff","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward F.
