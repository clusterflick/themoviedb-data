Twelve of the world’s top athletes. Two raging punk rock bands. Six months of planning. Nine days of rehearsal. One jaw broken in four places. One huge night in Las Vegas. Thousands of screaming fans. This isn’t like any recipe your mom ever made. This is The Making of Tony Hawk’s Boom Boom Huck Jam – a heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat, out-of-your-head display of daredevil talent. In fact, it is the only action sports and music show that matters. This is your behind-the- scenes credential to watch how the show came together for the Las Vegas kickoff at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. Join Tony Hawk and his crew of skateboard wizards, models, and magicians as they gather on a $1.2 million customized ramp/track system for a show that had never before been created, and which others may only hope to imitate.","popularity":1.6098,"poster_path":"/cDORExxydkoHgZBXUFHCDLCQ08F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3742,"logo_path":null,"name":"900
