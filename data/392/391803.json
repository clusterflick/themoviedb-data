Following the life and work of several characters in four cities of former Yugoslavia the film explores two issues â€“ what it means to be a cultural worker in post-socialist contexts of Skopje, Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana, and what the possibilities for action and intervention in social reality are, from the position of art and culture. In this way, the film reflects on actual tendencies and problematics at the critical independent cultural scenes, as well as on relations between art, theory and activism, which are strongly present in the region.","popularity":0.0472,"poster_path":"/6FhJ57coZr8BcV3gMzINN5gx0BO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109982,"logo_path":null,"name":"TkH (Walking Theory)","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":137419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kontrapunkt","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2013-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cultural Worker: 3 in 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Popivoda","original_name":"Marta Popivoda","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57068854c3a3686569000171","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Popivoda","original_name":"Marta Popivoda","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbf39830e0a2624c600c891","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34698695","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1546,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6FhJ57coZr8BcV3gMzINN5gx0BO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1040}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
