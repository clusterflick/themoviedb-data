Asked \"So how many crazy people watched you?\", he responded: \"A whole crazy, psychologically disturbed nation\". Why were the Germans or to be more precise, the West Germans, a psychologically disturbed nation at that time? This is a film about cheerful and serious games, therapies for re-education and self-imposed re-education, as well as the history of the idea of permanent revolution. Those appearing include directors and producers of gameshows, psychiatrists, anthropologists, and the diversely paranoid.","popularity":0.1952,"poster_path":"/zj85AirM4XdHkoxqugeQe9wcAJ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutz Dammbeck Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overgames","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647887d6e323f300e5233c03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julischka Eichel","original_name":"Julischka Eichel","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/kdBUvVQDIN8XunZYn1uS4U7vw7J.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"647887fa174973013500104b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Rudolph","original_name":"Sebastian Rudolph","popularity":0.2148,"profile_path":"/qct6kKiahTQ0KYlEYIOb56rs21n.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"647888130e29a20133c2364c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Prelinger","original_name":"Rick Prelinger","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6478882d076ce80149edee6c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2264958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Boden","original_name":"Bob Boden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64788855cf4b8b00c3d0e4dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Zimbardo","original_name":"Philip Zimbardo","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/lCbcY8qjDHF0ANh93ypJD1XYImb.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64788891cf4b8b00a87656d2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"57022630c3a36856ab0025e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"57022639c3a368568c002921","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39540,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.U.
