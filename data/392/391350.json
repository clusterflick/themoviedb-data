She heard about the blessing Wilford Woodruff gave her mother, promising that she and her children would reach their destination and experience the Lord's providential hand on more than one occasion.  But Jane was only an infant when they made their harrowing journey and is beginning to doubt her mother's fantastic stories -- until she receives a miracle of her own.","popularity":0.465,"poster_path":"/wUnNkqcGrTzdgt6vFTMbWIv2hTX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Remember Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Elizabeth Panting Story","title":"A 2nd Witness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":576250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Wadley","original_name":"Emily Wadley","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Elizabeth Panting","credit_id":"5702ccf092514117260007f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrienne Carr","original_name":"Adrienne Carr","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jane Panting","credit_id":"5702cd18c3a3685688003923","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":988413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Matheson","original_name":"Peggy Matheson","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Adult Jane Panting","credit_id":"5702cddbc3a368568c004124","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1417558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Lexerot","original_name":"Antonio Lexerot","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/rX6pTDmnYik0pdr9iAvkskWX0di.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Frederick Panting","credit_id":"5702ce9592514151b8001c0a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Cook","original_name":"Catherine Cook","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jane's Daughter","credit_id":"5702ceb7c3a3685686003791","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Gollaher","original_name":"Mark Gollaher","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Wilford Woodruff","credit_id":"5702ced19251416072003b53","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasen Wade","original_name":"Jasen Wade","popularity":0.2765,"profile_path":"/zVPgpkxBoTzw2mZPH0UOYMbrXYN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Levi Savage","credit_id":"5702cee5c3a3685694003e10","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Newbold","original_name":"Bruce Newbold","popularity":0.1234,"profile_path":"/wVUynX7vZnFL08hN9hUYTW9stj4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Traveler","credit_id":"5702cf2992514151b8001c16","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Diamond","original_name":"Bernie Diamond","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Speaker","credit_id":"5702cf629251416070003bb8","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"T.C.
