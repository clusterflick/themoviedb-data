Nearly 80,000 of those are held in solitary confinement. They have no human contact and every element of their environment is controlled. Meals come through a slot in the solid steel door, as does all communication with prison staff. They might be allowed to shower once a week. They might not see the outdoors for months or years on end. They spend 22-24 hours a day in their cell with little to no human contact for days or even decades. The sensory deprivation they endure causes severe psychological damage. These people are invisible to usâ€”and eventually to themselves. The UN has condemned solitary confinement. But it continues.

It is also a 2016 TFI New Media Fund grantee.)","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6X9: An Immersive Experience of Solitary Confinement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
