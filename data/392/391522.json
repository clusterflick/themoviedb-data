It is also a beautifully universal experience that works without words. An anonymous wanderer roams in a stripped down yet labyrinthine universe. All around him, arrows in ever changing shapes show him the way to go. Where will it lead? SENS explores narrative conventions around comics, gaming, and virtual reality in a new and exciting way. The creators have described it as an ‘immersive toboggan’ because you move from surprise to surprise. The wonderful thing about SENS is that you soon settle into its poetic pacing and relax knowing that wandering does not mean that you are lost.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sens","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
