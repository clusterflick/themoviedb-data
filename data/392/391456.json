Soon Jimmy finds things aren't working out and has little ambition to work or affection for May left. In desperation he sells May into the hands of a pimp and a madam in a brothel. They don't meet again until, wounded while running from the police, he runs into a hospital ward where she's being treated for the ravages of social diseases she's accrued in the course of her degradation.","popularity":0.0768,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75120,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.S.
