All he had to do, he thought, was blag his way into the English press corps and look like he knew what he was doing. In 2010, Miles told the story of that (mis)adventure in a show at the Edinburgh Festival, which received over twenty 4 star reviews. Two UK tours of the show followed, finishing up in London's West End. The book of the story was nominated for The William Hill Sports Book Of The Year. In 2014, Miles (who likes to think things over for a bit) suddenly decided that he wanted to record the show, so he dusted it off and headed to The Torch Theatre in Milford Haven and performed the show all over again in front of some cameras, some microphones and a very nice audience of predominantly Welsh people. This is that show.","popularity":0.2504,"poster_path":"/eCY5iXubF1CdwLpy8RVTTyrTJzr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33022,"logo_path":"/5d2uhejtffJP8vPgVeBH5jv0emd.png","name":"Go Faster Stripe","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles Jupp: Fibber in the Heat","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Jupp","original_name":"Miles Jupp","popularity":0.2476,"profile_path":"/xVNI6kPi16lpIce0WQfS3DnIspT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57076472c3a368650c00235f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Searles","original_name":"Peter Searles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570763b89251412b070021fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Jupp","original_name":"Miles Jupp","popularity":0.2476,"profile_path":"/xVNI6kPi16lpIce0WQfS3DnIspT.jpg","credit_id":"5707645c9251412b0700220f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Cox","original_name":"Neil Cox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57076435c3a36831790007d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13968574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rZu4fGNq1rFNOgyfU0MqHzujRdI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eCY5iXubF1CdwLpy8RVTTyrTJzr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x6aJBHdLPf79iOvLkh1OMtvNgNL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
