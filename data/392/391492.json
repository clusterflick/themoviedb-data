Jones is cast as war hero Johnny Kovacs, who wearies of the adulation heaped upon him and takes refuge under an assumed name in a theatrical boarding house. Here he befriends orchestra leader Phil Spitalny and his all-girl aggregation, including the inimitable Evelyn and Her Magic Violin. When Army officials trace Johnny to the boarding house, his new friends assume that he's a deserter and try to convince him to return to duty.","popularity":0.5088,"poster_path":"/2fzDGIaEgFvWrZfXZkLm2H5VtF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"FORWARD MARCH! for romance...rhythm...and fun!","title":"When Johnny Comes Marching Home","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Jones","original_name":"Allan Jones","popularity":0.2371,"profile_path":"/m86mHhAbRSYPgxwAsjQbwMmQ0Cm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Johnny Kovacs aka Johnny O'Rourke","credit_id":"57040aa3c3a36869890004e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Frazee","original_name":"Jane Frazee","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/dhxIqsrzLr9r8rrWlNio9Jkf6hN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joyce Benton","credit_id":"57040aaec3a368697a0004d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Jean","original_name":"Gloria Jean","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/lKnkc9FvgBdUnIwH3iqgyubnveR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marilyn Benton","credit_id":"57040ab8c3a368697200055a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald O'Connor","original_name":"Donald O'Connor","popularity":0.5852,"profile_path":"/sV7Dx16wcajPsxJItmW5dX4axoW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Frankie Flanagan","credit_id":"57040ac39251415bbe0004e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Ryan","original_name":"Peggy Ryan","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/4AVB1gkMaZlSzsUIlw6OHYsGRS8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dusty","credit_id":"57040ad0c3a368698500050d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Everton","original_name":"Paul Everton","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/epDMiRMgBFKcywcPpdtIMnnlv4l.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Speaker (uncredited)","credit_id":"573ccca89251413f55000771","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Hayes","original_name":"Grace Hayes","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/aj9JRmkAaJTiDcmNBpLgSZ1Oi2N.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Orchestra Violinist","credit_id":"585580f79251416fad0411c1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Davies","original_name":"Richard Davies","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/vTJlXSFMrk5wM4ue5OsdX9QA52A.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lt.
