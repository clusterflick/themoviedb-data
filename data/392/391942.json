An orchestra and a choir, along with a large group of adolescents who act as \"living-music-stands\", are filmed as they play the first part of Mahler’s 8th Symphony. The musicians gradually begin to move in a precise choreography, led by their living-music-stands. As these movements are executed, disparate groups of musicians, singers, and living-music-stands begin to disappear along with the sounds that they emit. The music progressively becomes a sound object captured in the course of its own erosion, which corresponds to the slow dissolution of the landscape’s visibility due to the setting sun. Ultimately, the music as a sound object and the landscape as a visual object become identical, all while being completely transformed in regard to the starting configuration. Thus, in TRENTO SYMPHONIA, the landscape becomes a point of convergence between contemplation, correspondence, and imagination.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trento Symphonia","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flatform","original_name":"Flatform","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5707df5fc3a368651600335f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3475238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
