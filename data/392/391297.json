The flickers of that story coming through the media tend to be in black and white, with heroes and villains, and the film Gugliotta what it shows is how, with successes and failures, all work around a same idea, which is to better education in better conditions. Naturally it is not here an idyllic story is told, while there are conditions (\"state special situation in which it is someone or something\") in which it becomes very difficult to study and conditions ( \"ability or willingness\") against which it is also very difficult to hold any dialogue. But before the general state of tension, witness these dialogues is, at least, encouraging.
