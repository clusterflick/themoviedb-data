When he heads to the Great Outdoors to take possession, Jack winds up at the wrong place: a swanky dude ranch. He immediately begins running things, at it's quite a while before his error is discovered. By the time he shows up at his own ranch, he's up to his ears in unpaid debts-which naturally requires a fund-raising musical show as a bail-out. Harriet Hilliard handles the romantic portion of the proceedings, occasionally dueting with her real-life husband, bandleader Ozzie Nelson.","popularity":1.1468,"poster_path":"/9uEfrtYubt2VepfwLLhr6HA5fk4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pine-Thomas Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A SCREENFUL OF FUN STARS on a Rampage of Rhythm!","title":"Take It Big","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Haley","original_name":"Jack Haley","popularity":0.3432,"profile_path":"/bvZMv9OeLQT67zpprx5Og3QIDEA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack North","credit_id":"570595c09251411904000036","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harriet Nelson","original_name":"Harriet Nelson","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/kbHVnWSGEUFjwCCURswjRcPQpfW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jerry Clinton","credit_id":"570595cd92514118f8000031","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Beth Hughes","original_name":"Mary Beth Hughes","popularity":0.3673,"profile_path":"/25Hi4J133OcCfrBkrlnZVZDAvGJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gaye Livingston","credit_id":"570595d89251411907000032","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lane","original_name":"Richard Lane","popularity":0.2662,"profile_path":"/mzGnnilkdUC8Fzoq5z5GhhfV7yd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eddie Hampton","credit_id":"570595e7c3a36855c4000047","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arline Judge","original_name":"Arline Judge","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/7XDZw07chg6QgQlXwTCDiqQm76e.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pert Martin","credit_id":"570595f4c3a36855b800002f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Feld","original_name":"Fritz Feld","popularity":0.2544,"profile_path":"/yVT0Gv9O4K9UHU8jBx8D01lZjYZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Doctor Dittenhoffer","credit_id":"63bb0903a6e2d2008b3e09bd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucile Gleason","original_name":"Lucile Gleason","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/oXX342MTTtnDmusdhyFKfrQFMnJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"63bb091ec0a308007fc13f76","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuzzy Knight","original_name":"Fuzzy Knight","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/vv3sXhvCEpZxeG8WucH4p6JdaYl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Cowboy Joe","credit_id":"63bb0935fc31d300a8de1ec3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Forest","original_name":"Frank Forest","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Harvey Phillips","credit_id":"63bb0950e0ca7f00aee3a034","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Meeker","original_name":"George Meeker","popularity":0.3186,"profile_path":"/AoJtJAJGAdCYGnPiCxipob9skxE.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"John Hankinson","credit_id":"63bb0969ae6f093c5a93e561","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils T.
