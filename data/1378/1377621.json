He becomes romantically involved with a boy from Mardin whom he meets at 23. They decide to keep their relationship a secret. However, when his partner's family learns about the situation, they raid the house where they are together one night and kill Ali's partner. In the scuffle, Ali sustains a blow to his head, causing him to lose the memory of the past year. After completing his treatment, Ali begins to uncover the events of the last year. This search leads him to take a trip to Mardin, although he is unsure of the reason behind it. Upon arriving in Mardin, Ali starts to feel a sense of familiarity with certain things - the soil, the houses, the atmosphere - even though it is his first visit to this city. In an attempt to preserve the feeling of belonging he experiences at the places he visits, he collects soil. One night, he starts shaping the accumulated soil into a form, and as he does, some memories begin to resurface in Ali's mind.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/svhB8Fxb62xjYxHJs0kbiTalApj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poligala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5023791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barış Görkem Günaltay","original_name":"Barış Görkem Günaltay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"671d1554c7802cc5035a333e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Firat Kaya","original_name":"Firat Kaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"671d155b4542e371fe0ab13b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Süleyman Kun","original_name":"Süleyman Kun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d151334c0fabd681cbbeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Süleyman Kun","original_name":"Süleyman Kun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d151a427c5c19f0261b80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4242206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Süleyman Kun","original_name":"Süleyman Kun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d15214542e371fe0ab119","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3329459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Firat Kaya","original_name":"Firat Kaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d152f34c0fabd681cbc00","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svhB8Fxb62xjYxHJs0kbiTalApj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
