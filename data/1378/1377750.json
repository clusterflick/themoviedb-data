A DVD release? Seems a bit outdated. Blu ray? VHS? Well… Hehe. They wanted something that you can hold in your hand and that everyone can play on their TV, computer or whatever. So DeWolff came up with something cool: all 9 live videos will be released with remixed audio in superb hi-fi Electrosaurus quality on a specially designed limited edition DeWolff 3-D USB flash drive! We know it’s not a 9 LP box set, but unfortunately vinyl can’t play video and it would be very expensive. This USB flash drive though contains all 9 live videos in high resolution and with 48kHz audio.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/yrCL1BjSlygKJNIfDZG3NwYm3U7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spoor 14","origin_country":""},{"id":243012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electrosaurus studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DeWolff - Nonagon Marathon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5024270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo van de Poel","original_name":"Pablo van der Poel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/43Fd3nQjjS9GO7UCdXQG6VPo4AG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Guitar, Vocals","credit_id":"671d51f927bd57d91f62dd67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2587840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luka van de Poel","original_name":"Luka van de Poel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xrbEEa3rVZEKyN6nEYg2X8gCUSj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums, Vocals","credit_id":"678a50a193f742cc29ad1120","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2587841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Piso","original_name":"Robin Piso","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hammondorgan","credit_id":"678a5491c2470fc60bad0ac6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5024338,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Catharian Krom","original_name":"Catharian Krom","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d5b265be9e8759da769c5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5024343,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wessel Oltheten","original_name":"Wessel Oltheten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d5b952685cb6563c10535","department":"Sound","job":"Audio Post Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/yrCL1BjSlygKJNIfDZG3NwYm3U7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"3D Flash Drive","release_date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DeWolff - Nonagon Marathon (Trailer)","key":"M84msTQtPEQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-01T10:13:54.000Z","id":"671d5050b3d5cbb842f44897"}]}}}
