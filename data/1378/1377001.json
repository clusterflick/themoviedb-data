His perception of the world is both strange and wonderful. Her sister Emilie, in her teenage years, is seeking, not without difficulty, a balance between her family life and her life as a young girl. She is also intimidated by her brother's difference, which she does not know how to approach. Following a family conflict, Antoine and Emilie prefer to leave the family home. During this escapade, they will experience unusual situations, which will lead them to observe each other, to listen to each other and finally to succeed in finding a ground on which to exchange and see the richness of each other.","popularity":0.1649,"poster_path":"/xHvHboGYnBPaJbYudOeBUAJ8kPa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woooz pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":242871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opside.co","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When two worlds are looking for their voice","title":"Un Ailleurs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5021549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maude Delenne","original_name":"Maude Delenne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bxrrmjl41vQh5py1iYKD8Z3TEDe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emilie","credit_id":"671bbc83769107d77b47beca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3543941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Thebauld Korini","original_name":"Axel Thebauld Korini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Antoine","credit_id":"671bbc99769107d77b47bee9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4733953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Paul","original_name":"Emmanuel Paul","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/fTkTQH0I56OpgTnToy8RIA3vEn4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Père","credit_id":"671bbf63427c5c19f025f554","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2571928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Lise Prat","original_name":"Anne-Lise Prat","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mère","credit_id":"671bbf7d1ea33928297d3202","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5021574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Henzinski","original_name":"Jonathan Henzinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671bbeec2685cb6563c0d9f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5021574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Henzinski","original_name":"Jonathan Henzinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671bbf21a4ac8a432c5c4374","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5021666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mathieu Reynouard","original_name":"Mathieu Reynouard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671bca062685cb6563c0dc71","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34219389","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":993,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zjBLBnU6VBRUdErThUfs27mKGgP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1766}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xHvHboGYnBPaJbYudOeBUAJ8kPa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1646,"name":"autism"},{"id":4232,"name":"melancholy"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
