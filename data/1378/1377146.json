Yet by 1979, the band were penniless, victims of one of the greatest rock'n'roll rip-offs of all time. Today, lead singer Les McKeown lives in a small flat in London's East End. \"Probably I should have ten, 15, £20 millions,\" he says. So if he and the other band members were so royally ripped off, who made all the money? In this astonishing film, the outrageous deceptions to which the young band were subjected are revealed, as Les goes on a mission to discover who made what out of the exploitation of the Bay City Rollers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ge5LiA6rtB2hKGUNwf35aIQjGmh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Got The Rollers Millions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z2jWke3aFHKfRMhaRFlKsH3QgZg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ge5LiA6rtB2hKGUNwf35aIQjGmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
