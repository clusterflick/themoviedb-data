A rival candidate makes trouble and plants a bomb in the shop but Abie turns the tables on him. Election day finds Dolan's followers too lazy to vote. Abie stirs them up by offering to lick them and then running to the polling place with the mob at his heels. Dolan wins and so does Abie.","popularity":0.2789,"poster_path":"/dfOCKoB13oFxedWV7x4Pxcb8NUN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pawnshop Politics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Luddy","original_name":"Barbara Luddy","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/jXXbYWessv2MgXPu6fPg0B6sXDi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kitty","credit_id":"671cd6d34be15469e70dd79b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Harris","original_name":"George Harris","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/uHEp2uYGgDJ1Cb6DkLh8ns0vPkJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Abie","credit_id":"671cd6fc769107d77b47dfbd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Franklin","original_name":"Sidney Franklin","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/5OtdGALyfs5OW1aJ0a109PnElJk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"671cd7081ea33928297d55a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barney Gilmore","original_name":"Barney Gilmore","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/1zssnBqPf7XYLeuNe0Nid3EQ6kF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"671cd70e769107d77b47dfd3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincente Howard","original_name":"Vincente Howard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"671cd719769107d77b47dfdd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Stoloff","original_name":"Benjamin Stoloff","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671cd72a4542e371fe0aa59c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Murray Roth","original_name":"Murray Roth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671cd7381ea33928297d55d9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Murray Roth","original_name":"Murray Roth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671cd7411ea33928297d55de","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
