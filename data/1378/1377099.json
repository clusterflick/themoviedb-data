Последний шаман","overview":"\"Nya\" - this is how little nation of central Taimyr, nganasans call themselves. This film is about the destiny of last nganasan shaman. Just forty years ago nganasans still were nomadic on a large territory between mountain massif Byrranga and plato Pytorana. Soviet government didn't understand at all a lifestyle like this, because it is difficult to control nomads. Nganasans were forced to live sedentary. Shamans were repressed and killed. Nowadays nganasan's traditional culture was left only in memory of elders but in archive of russian science academy there are uniqe videomaterials  of etnographic expedition from 1968 dedicated to two nganasan shamans, who were conducting a ceremony of first snow encounter. This film introduces to us descendant of those shamans and shows every day life of last Taimyr shaman, who have managed to save all \"equipment\" inherited from father and grandfather - famous shamans.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/em9v62pD0A4EwF36J0O3QdaSdBi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabu.
