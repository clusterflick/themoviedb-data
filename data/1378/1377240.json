His task seems simple — walk 30 yards to feed a fish swimming in a fish tank. The trouble is, he also has a handful of blue berries, which when eaten sends him into a stupor. Inspired by Millstein’s own experience of getting addicted to painkillers, the film resonates beyond its surface design as a cautionary tale.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/wtTzdBbst4tqoS8DZdzavZfedce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Berries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Millstein","original_name":"Sam Millstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"671c276f5be9e8759da74a6f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4320991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Millstein","original_name":"Sam Millstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c27884542e371fe0a8dc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995865,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Tetro","original_name":"Sam Tetro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c2798c7802cc5035a15ad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622976,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Emilio Subia","original_name":"Emilio Subia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c27a9c7802cc5035a15b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5022423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emma Howard","original_name":"Emma Howard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c27d14542e371fe0a8de6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134269,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Howells","original_name":"Sam Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c27e727bd57d91f62ad15","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489316,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joe D'Amico","original_name":"Joe D'Amico","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c27ff427c5c19f02605c2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5022425,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Claire Whitney","original_name":"Claire Whitney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c281627bd57d91f62ad38","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wtTzdBbst4tqoS8DZdzavZfedce.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Blue Berries","key":"KUYE2AO_NIY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-12-16T16:08:00.000Z","id":"671c274727bd57d91f62ace8"}]}}}
