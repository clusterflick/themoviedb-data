She looks at her garden, mindful of the concealed rhythms of plants and animals. A moose visits her. She follows it and there begins a strange journey where the world and her flow together, until they become one.  Director Unt creates a beautiful story of rebirth and emancipation. To achieve this, she uses several animation techniques for each step she makes, each metamorphosis she undergoes, from cut-outs to moving sand, from traditional 2D to point-of-view shots. The viewer can appreciate the textures, the tactile quality of the film, and, at the same time, how the main character gets freer in the frame. Thereâ€™s indeed an expert lightness of touch at work here.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/daqFsN4DqOdR3mf0P3f24otgrYo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flow of Being","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4496226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Unt","original_name":"Helen Unt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e017c6d6b705dc871acea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/daqFsN4DqOdR3mf0P3f24otgrYo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
