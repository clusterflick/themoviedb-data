Think Puberty Blues, but without the men. The film aims to shed light on the power of community, encourage more women to embrace surfing, and provoke dialogue surrounding localism and unfair hierarchies in surfing and society at large. Tess embodies a relatable journey of youth, passivity, and insecurity - counterbalanced with her poignant connection to the ocean, offering healing after losing her father. This exploration of grief and self-discovery aims to resonate with audiences and support those experiencing similar emotions. Additionally, the film explores a queer subplot, utilizing Emma and Tess's love story to symbolize Tess's courageous self-exploration, reflecting the theme of self-liberation and empowerment through embracing one's true identity.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/ovlZvlECQ5NSjU9qUjRbBbRGYeV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bathers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theresa Roberts","original_name":"Theresa Roberts","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"671c66436d6b705dc8717709","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4126208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domino McCathrion","original_name":"Domino McCathrion","popularity":0.1827,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"671c664b6d6b705dc8717714","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5022801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Keenan","original_name":"Matthew Keenan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"671c66ae1ea33928297d4719","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3003719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Williams","original_name":"Peter Williams","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/aBpePNzepFedWGsGdfXgRqAEzry.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6773ebb4fbe3722a9861873a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theresa Roberts","original_name":"Theresa Roberts","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c661ea4ac8a432c5c5898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theresa Roberts","original_name":"Theresa Roberts","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c662a4be15469e70dcac5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33254533","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1iDr6fa58511Yj6fId8CCohGAtR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ovlZvlECQ5NSjU9qUjRbBbRGYeV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mardi Gras Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
