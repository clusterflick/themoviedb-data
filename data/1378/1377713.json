Community, love, conflict and legacy all come into play when a healthy litter of puppies is suddenly paralyzed and no one knows why. Vets recommend putting the dogs down, but a group of courageous women rally together and nothing is off the table as they try Chinese herbs, acupuncture, underwater treadmills and even chicken soup to save the pups.
