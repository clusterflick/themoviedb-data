This is because there is a continuation of movement between the images in one frame and the next. On the other hand, since each frame is a single photograph, it is possible to trim and enlarge or reduce the image frame by frame. For example, if the normal zoom process is A→B→C→D, by enlarging and reducing each frame, it can become C→A→D→B. This is not unnatural since a movie is a series of photographs. The movement of the subject is continuous within the image that is enlarged and reduced frame by frame.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/dsAm3DDuoKib5kPbCqWQcBmH9XV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Air Current","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kota","original_name":"Isao Kota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d49dac7802cc5035a3e35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dsAm3DDuoKib5kPbCqWQcBmH9XV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
