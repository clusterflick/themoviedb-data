Before long, warm feelings arise between the two. While taking a walk in the forest, they happen to come across one of Eugen’s acquaintances, the beautiful noblewoman Miss LeBlanc. Eugen is hit hard by Cupid’s arrow and forgets all about Alice, whose heart breaks into a thousand pieces. Eugen leaves his position as tutor unaware that in doing so, he is also leaving his unborn child behind. Alice clandestinely gives birth to a small child with a large birthmark on its forehead. She writes to Eugen in the hope of financial support, but he refuses, and when no help is forthcoming from her parents either, she reluctantly hands the child over to an orphanage. Meanwhile, Eugen has married LeBlanc, and the two adopt a little boy with a large birthmark on his forehead.
