By removing the narrative and distilling the form to pure format, the film investigates the database mode of horror subgenre by instead highlighting the grammar of cinema. Considering the subgenre as a direct pipeline of social anxiety, our practice is one of distillation: the cross-section of power and desire. It examines the power of suggestion, reaching towards what is hidden through techniques of absenting and remaking. The relationship between sound and image lies at the core of this onscreen/offscreen tension.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A woman runs away from something","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5022136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Vorster","original_name":"Beatrice Vorster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c0680b3d5cbb842f41e94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5022139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasmin Vardi","original_name":"Yasmin Vardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c06a04542e371fe0a8b10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spryte","release_date":"2024-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
