Tribute and lament, the piece is played here by Gérard Caussé, assisted, if one can say so, by a garden banded snail. Riding the bow, the gastropod goes from the bottom to the top of the stick during the music. The title, which is a logic expression that imposes a double condition simultaneously, points to the link between animal and human, between music and silence, between seeing and listening, between two astonishments, two sliding virtuosities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If and Only If","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5022188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Caussé","original_name":"Gérard Caussé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"671c0a71769107d77b47c63c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anri Sala","original_name":"Anri Sala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c0a7e9ff681d9e0a41aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
