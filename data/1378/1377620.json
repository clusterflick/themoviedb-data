Already renowned in Italy, Handel introduced himself to the city of London with his opera Rinaldo in 1711, which was such a success that he decided to remain in England for good. It is still regarded as one of his greatest operas. Set during the Crusades, Rinaldo is a lavish spectacle that tells a story of love, magic, struggles for power and ultimate reconciliation. Pier Luigi Pizzi’s acclaimed production brings us into a ‘dreamlike, unreal … world of spells and incantations’ (Epoca).
