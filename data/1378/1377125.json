When von Pfalz sees Linda give Barner an amulet containing her portrait, his fears are confirmed, and he breaks off the engagement. Linda is relieved, but her parents are dismayed at the prospect of having a dissolute artist as a son-in-law. Linda’s mother approaches Barner in tears and asks him to end the relationship with her daughter. Crumpling at the sight of these maternal tears, Barner comes up with a plan to push Linda away. By the time he realises the true depth of his feelings for the young countess, it is too late.
