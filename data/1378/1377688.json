But his picture-perfect retreat isn’t quite perfect. The caretaker, Mila, is oddly nosy, the only thing in the fridge is vodka, and the rental instructions have one unsettling rule: “Always close and lock the patio door.”  After trying to call a friend to apologize for his bad behaviour, Hugo succumbs to temptation. He drinks, he smokes, he leaves the patio door open. Just as he catches his error, Hugo is confronted by an eerily demon on the patio threshold. Hugo and the demon struggle with the door—but will that be enough to keep the demon out?","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A struggling alcoholic heads to a remote cabin only to discover that it's not just his inner demons he has to wrestle with.","title":"Close and Lock The Patio Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Beil","original_name":"Ryan Beil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hugo","credit_id":"671ecdb12685cb6563c13699","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maddy Kelly","original_name":"Maddy Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mela","credit_id":"671ecdc6e833d92ef0608d7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Chavez","original_name":"Mark Chavez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chubba Chubba / Cabin Owner (voice)","credit_id":"671ece43e833d92ef0608e18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsten Wiltshire","original_name":"Kirsten Wiltshire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sheriff's Office Receptionist (voice)","credit_id":"671ece79fefd1e0510009426","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
