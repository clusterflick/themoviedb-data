I was carrying a tripod with an 8mm camera on it, so it was a selfie from behind. The tripod is always in the frame, so it has a strong presence. The film was then projected and each frame was re-shot at different zoom ratios, allowing viewers to alternate between looking at the entire screen and the center, frame by frame. In the second half, I re-photographed the screen so that the tilted landscape on the screen was returned to a horizontal position, expressing the idea that the landscape is stationary and it is the viewfinder that moves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nrJatxoa3wfnRrrvjBnCvAufHJd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1974-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kota","original_name":"Isao Kota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671d4503fefd1e051000518a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrJatxoa3wfnRrrvjBnCvAufHJd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
