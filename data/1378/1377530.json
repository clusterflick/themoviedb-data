The novice Fernand abandons his monastery having fallen in love with the noble Léonor, not knowing that she is the King’s mistress and favourite. Drawing on traditions established by Rossini and Meyerbeer, La Favorite is noted for Donizetti’s innovative use of the orchestra and for some of his most renowned and enthralling arias. This acclaimed production opened the 2022 Donizetti Opera Festival in Bergamo, and is performed with its original French libretto.","popularity":0.4311,"poster_path":"/lKv6PAcbPRJeRx33tCeq98c8Qkp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donizetti -
