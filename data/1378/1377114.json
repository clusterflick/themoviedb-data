He is courted by almost all of his students, but Else is the one to whom he ultimately proposes. Their engagement is announced on Else’s 18th birthday, much to the horror of her parents, who want a less common son-in-law. They send her to her room, but she soon runs away. Together with Petersen, she drives out into the balmy summer night to cause a scandal so that her parents will have to let them marry. Pat and Patachon, who work for a temping agency and were previously hired as temporary servants for the birthday party, are now called in as detectives to track down the runaway couple.
