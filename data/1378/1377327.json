Santi MacLean's \"rip\" meshes sensibilities of a teen sitcom with characters deeply immersed into a gen-Z vernacular. Through several camera POV's, a Macbook webcam being the main, we watch Berlin and Cola sit in a small room chatting over a cold pizza. To the extent that their youthful minds will allow, they eagerly share their thoughts on SSRI's, dead pets, AP classes, and queerness. Following their incredibly quick back and forth is a bit of a roller coaster, but it's amusing nonetheless. With its several phone-screen overlays and sporadic graphic bursts, the duo's dynamic is as hyperactive as the film's visual modes.","popularity":0.0706,"poster_path":"/oeoaZA0PdfFh0u2hJ5acMcRr5dq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Marano","original_name":"Isabella Marano","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"671c63fb427c5c19f0260e06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Renee Dixon","original_name":"Ashley Renee Dixon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"671c640127bd57d91f62b52b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santi MacLean","original_name":"Santi MacLean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c63e61ea33928297d45a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santi MacLean","original_name":"Santi MacLean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671c63ec1ea33928297d45a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33796680","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oeoaZA0PdfFh0u2hJ5acMcRr5dq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
