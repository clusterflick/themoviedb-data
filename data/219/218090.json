In typical screwball-comedy fashion, the plot is set in motion by authoress Nicky Henderson, who has hit the best-seller charts with her latest tome, Why Marry a Latin? While researching her next book in Rio De Janeiro, she finds out \"why\" when she meets handsome songwriter Miguel Soares. Upon learning about Nicky's book, Miguel decides to teach her a few lessons in the affairs of the heart. Edward Everett Horton is also on hand, twittering his way through the role of a well-meaning buttinsky. Thanks to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy of the 1940s, South American musicals were a glut on the market, but Brazil was good enough on its own merits to pay its way at the box office.","popularity":0.938,"poster_path":"/lDpqZLKRKv0jmLjJwSflOtKDcc0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Musical Love Story of Pan-America!","title":"Brazil","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Stars and Guitars","type":"Reissue title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Guízar","original_name":"Tito Guízar","popularity":0.3112,"profile_path":"/8WZ4xOCtb1lnpj5jPlkOKuzKtOL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Miguel Soares","credit_id":"52fe4e44c3a368484e217479","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Bruce","original_name":"Virginia Bruce","popularity":0.211,"profile_path":"/w5PTPvhlvMNGE9ddyFP1n9EBnwW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nicky Henderson","credit_id":"52fe4e44c3a368484e21747d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Everett Horton","original_name":"Edward Everett Horton","popularity":0.3955,"profile_path":"/wtoC3cXLStuYmiEUVQavdvbh5Js.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Everett St. John Everett","credit_id":"52fe4e44c3a368484e217481","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Livingston","original_name":"Robert Livingston","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/9TDnvUPeWnBS7mPeGeIlHhTLLIe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Rod Walker","credit_id":"52fe4e44c3a368484e217485","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lane","original_name":"Richard Lane","popularity":0.2662,"profile_path":"/mzGnnilkdUC8Fzoq5z5GhhfV7yd.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Edward Graham","credit_id":"5cc21ebbc3a368694c8e352a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1464505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veloz","original_name":"Veloz","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/b7f1fIKTxAy3VA6JMf0794auG8A.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Veloz","credit_id":"55e44016c3a368419a003d53","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1464507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolanda","original_name":"Yolanda","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/j4CTXleav1545etpY30vUpgspMt.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Yolanda","credit_id":"55e4410492514137d7003b93","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fortunio Bonanova","original_name":"Fortunio Bonanova","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/39RJP5GMzaw1Bh6hBaYK6qsEDW1.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Senor Renaldo Da Silva","credit_id":"55e441df92514137dd003b93","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Puglia","original_name":"Frank Puglia","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/r1wLNTEnjKEQGrfUB5qzf8RpiCn.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Señor Machado","credit_id":"55e441fe92514137e6003c2f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Rogers","original_name":"Roy Rogers","popularity":0.5476,"profile_path":"/1ZKQNYHS0YO4691hqD1Tgd3nvkY.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Roy Rogers","credit_id":"55e4421e92514137dd003bab","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurora Miranda","original_name":"Aurora Miranda","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/vuJuI1mxdhve815sOla3nJf2B17.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Ballerina, Specialty Dancer","credit_id":"5cc21ee0925141593ef3459a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":535272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Lupino","original_name":"Rita Lupino","popularity":0.1345,"profile_path":"/mLO3I2PDdqUnhA5InrE2qGh0MoC.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Dancer (uncredited)","credit_id":"61479dcc22df2e0046da49ae","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack A.
