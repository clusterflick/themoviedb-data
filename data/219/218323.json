For a long time, they have been looking for a voice for their new cartoon feature, \"Paddy the Pig,\" and the cop is just perfect. The policeman is tickled pink at the prospect of being a star and begins telling all his friends about his good fortune (he has no idea what they plan to do with his voice). Eventually he ends up marrying one of the producers, who still hasn't told him the truth. Suddenly the night of the big premiere finally arrives and all of the policeman's old friends and colleagues are there. As it begins, the policeman is appalled and humiliated to see that he has been mocked and has become a laughing stock. He immediately spurns his new wife and goes back to the police force. Time passes, and fortunately, the two reunite and settle their differences.","popularity":0.964,"poster_path":"/ckr7csSMtUPQxxPBNzR6aOTwXBa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Married a Cop","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Regan","original_name":"Phil Regan","popularity":0.2884,"profile_path":"/nvUcH9MwZMwlAzU4YxKVQGET5dw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jimmy Duffy","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e218759","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Parker","original_name":"Jean Parker","popularity":0.2397,"profile_path":"/ksj01GbanOhoZD5rXk99IVRx9QB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Linda Fay","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e21875d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Cowan","original_name":"Jerome Cowan","popularity":0.402,"profile_path":"/79be685su9LMAr41HMVKby0FsTg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bob Adams","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e218761","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Kent","original_name":"Dorothea Kent","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/y5utXdRZ8MAjrDDgVJS5nyJp6uq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mabel Dunne","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e218765","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Baker","original_name":"Benny Baker","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/jOdEf2SQCtROQHQfbJp9Ox5jgx5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sidney","credit_id":"56b4ce8fc3a36806ec0064a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barnett Parker","original_name":"Barnett Parker","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/7pDLLAA0MJgM63mwWmNqPB1Jk18.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bekins, the Butler","credit_id":"56b4ce9d9251417dca001d8b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horace McMahon","original_name":"Horace McMahon","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/moIW21jHP8DYollXSZ3LCRTaJD0.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Joe Nash","credit_id":"56b4cea992514112b900453b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Gordon","original_name":"Mary Gordon","popularity":0.1986,"profile_path":"/5jhUhQa0ArqB8p5cr8EwIXNeihx.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Ma Duffy","credit_id":"5cf1d1500e0a2679d3cbbdde","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar O'Shea","original_name":"Oscar O'Shea","popularity":0.1364,"profile_path":"/shWnx3maJa24MT3EmNnXhOSAKXs.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Pa Duffy","credit_id":"5cf1d178c3a368735b219a2d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Ryan","original_name":"Peggy Ryan","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/4AVB1gkMaZlSzsUIlw6OHYsGRS8.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Trudy","credit_id":"5cf1d183925141247cba1e8c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Keene","original_name":"Richard Keene","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/kSrGTjWZtOfTzyQ12WT7W9H09pi.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"637e572c514c4a008459600d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3799757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Campbell","original_name":"Muriel Campbell","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Minnie","credit_id":"637e5741514c4a00b9e40873","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Salkow","original_name":"Sidney Salkow","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e218755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103496,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ernest Miller","original_name":"Ernest Miller","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d1b6939251412e51008c23","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103673,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ernest J.
