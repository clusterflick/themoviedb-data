The woman he has loved has vanished from his life 'forever'. Rene Maurer, one of his regular patients, has died - an apparent suicide. Rene's sister, Erika, traveling to London to sort out his things, discovers something curious - his apartment is almost empty. A cup, a spoon, a fork, a knife, frames without pictures, torn photos... One more curiosity - a list of memories. Four dated descriptions of moments in Rene's life. Another patient dies. Another list of memories. There's something strange going on. Something sinister behind these 'suicides'","popularity":0.1907,"poster_path":"/j6baxtqxevWKXiJc8tT3atticGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Contact","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Scott-Walker","original_name":"Tim Scott-Walker","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Dr. David Wright","credit_id":"548717819251417606001afa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1396912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristiana Dell'Anna","original_name":"Cristiana Dell'Anna","popularity":0.2614,"profile_path":"/AwxKGjuWOXyeY4v157zEkI9w0MB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Theresa","credit_id":"54871798c3a3681cfd00214f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1396913,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristina Erdely","original_name":"Kristina Erdely","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/8wEqaGnwIjvL1JHhn1iCbTOrUdM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"548717a9c3a3681cf6001ef8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Gallavardin","original_name":"Geraldine Gallavardin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Moser","credit_id":"548717bfc3a3681cf6001efd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1396915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jannica Olin","original_name":"Jannica Olin","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":"/sbjeUNaSV7yzUJxSHaSeK6AwLSX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Erika Maurer","credit_id":"548717df9251417600001b76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1396916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Popova","original_name":"Virginia Popova","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/3l3bHtcB3As6eI4XTKNgEkJKhK3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Enigmatic Woman","credit_id":"548717f59251417603001c55","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Horrocks","original_name":"Simon Horrocks","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54871854c3a3681d00001ae6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Horrocks","original_name":"Simon Horrocks","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5487182392514175fa001a47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396918,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Fogg","original_name":"Sarah Fogg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548718a0c3a3681d00001ae9","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Horrocks","original_name":"Simon Horrocks","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54871844c3a3681d00001ae1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Horrocks","original_name":"Simon Horrocks","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548718379251417603001c5b","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Horrocks","original_name":"Simon Horrocks","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5487180e9251417600001b7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2059318","wikidata_id":"Q7784809","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tGur6Pvii2cJRWJLW2t931jM3Nw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6baxtqxevWKXiJc8tT3atticGr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
