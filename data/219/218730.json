While time moves on, and the years pass by, we allow ourselves to become more subjected to psychological and developmental damage brought on by a system of control, rules, response-abilities and consequences. How long has this damage been happening, and how has it effected the natural course of human evolution and progress as a species? Is there truly a master plan in effect to restrict our potential and keep us from evolving into what we are truly meant to be as a people? It is important that the world is connected in oneness, but is this simply an idea or part of the plan to bring in a one world government system?","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/gRWLKqdFcdfYvkaPbhVMZEtFDGU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye of the Illuminati","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Howitt","original_name":"Mark Howitt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60ca1bf91130bd007982ea6f","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRWLKqdFcdfYvkaPbhVMZEtFDGU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
