Adolphe Menjou plays the Barrymore counterpart, a loose-living movie star with a penchant for wine, women, and more wine. Alice Faye plays a nightclub singer hungry for publicity. Her agent (Gregory Ratoff) arranges a \"romance\" between Faye and Menjou. Eventually Faye winds up with Michael Whalen, allowing Menjou to continue his blissful, bibulous bachelorhood. Sing, Baby, Sing represented the feature-film debut of the Ritz Brothers, who are in top form in their specialty numbers--and who are awarded a final curtain call after the \"The End\" title, just so the audience won't forget them (The same device was used to introduce British actor George Sanders in Fox's Lancer Spy [37]).","popularity":1.7868,"poster_path":"/gfCQ8ZSIAUIHrjADh27Q2yz2Nae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Mad, Merry, Musical Delight!","title":"Sing, Baby, Sing","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Faye","original_name":"Alice Faye","popularity":0.2283,"profile_path":"/jC15KAoPnRWuuGWP2msKxWZsa3I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joan Warren","credit_id":"52fe4e4bc3a368484e218b91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolphe Menjou","original_name":"Adolphe Menjou","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/fQJ9Py7D5UpKvKNWM7Uykl38OLG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bruce Farraday","credit_id":"52fe4e4bc3a368484e218b95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Ratoff","original_name":"Gregory Ratoff","popularity":0.2616,"profile_path":"/u7uLiwMka8ipsZU5YE3jxe3HVcH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nicholas K.
