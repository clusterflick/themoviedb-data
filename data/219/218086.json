Set just after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the film stars Anna Sten as Natasha, a Red Cross volunteer who is dispatched to a field hospital located in an old pre-revolution mansion. American test pilot John Hill (Kent Smith), who'd been in Russia on a goodwill mission, is wounded in battle and brought to the hospital. As he slowly recovers from his wounds, Hill falls in love with Natasha. A last-act crisis develops when the hospital personnel are forced to move immediately to Leningrad as the Nazis advance.","popularity":0.4476,"poster_path":"/te6pPA1ccaMZnPhYRRn4fTpo5tA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108195,"logo_path":null,"name":"R-F Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kiss me now -- for always !","title":"Three Russian Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Sten","original_name":"Anna Sten","popularity":0.1451,"profile_path":"/K4qzmK8XgJtJ2jCIx1hmbLJfF9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Natasha","credit_id":"5301c1d4925141218f225d7e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Smith","original_name":"Kent Smith","popularity":0.5709,"profile_path":"/2GHATvR422EaWU7BkSoj9kbgzt0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Hill","credit_id":"5301c1e49251412192253c4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Forsythe","original_name":"Mimi Forsythe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/kwqs7KPlUZPytiLLuhArmFROWJq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tamara","credit_id":"5301c1f192514121a421dce7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Granach","original_name":"Alexander Granach","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/6oeYojEL9uLSJezeChUNFiRJohs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Major Braginski","credit_id":"5301c1ff925141219e212a37","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Frye","original_name":"Kathy Frye","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/9pSlNczoez7ytUuyPnWguIQ3sif.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Chijik","credit_id":"5b82e2120e0a26458c029474","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Guilfoyle","original_name":"Paul Guilfoyle","popularity":0.3278,"profile_path":"/tY6Y081ixQU4H0TdeUyaLx12Lpp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Trishin","credit_id":"5b82e220c3a3686560029c49","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kane Richmond","original_name":"Kane Richmond","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/9RC70XyxCoBejRAfgqv8FMfSmef.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sergei","credit_id":"5b82e22dc3a3686560029c59","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manart Kippen","original_name":"Manart Kippen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"5b82e23cc3a368655502ef20","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Gardner","original_name":"Jack Gardner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Misha","credit_id":"5b82e24992514159ce0265f8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Lenack","original_name":"Marcia Lenack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Shoora","credit_id":"5b82e2560e0a264589029a6d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Herriot","original_name":"Mary Herriot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Zina","credit_id":"5b82e26392514159ce026616","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Marie Stewart","original_name":"Anna Marie Stewart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"5b82e271c3a36865580372ea","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1329831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gray","original_name":"Dorothy Gray","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Manya","credit_id":"5b82e28092514159d9027d22","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feodor Chaliapin Jr.","original_name":"Feodor Chaliapin Jr.","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/5UGVHeLTHgKyO9SiJ4rrtpRWQHI.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Terkin (as Feodor Chaliapin)","credit_id":"5b82e28e0e0a26458602d010","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry S.
