Very little of Herbert's life story is incorporated in the screenplay (a closing title actually apologizes for the film's paucity of cold hard facts); instead, the writers allow the famed composer's works to speak for themselves. In the tradition of one of his own operettas, Herbert spends most of his time patching up the shaky marriage between tenor John Ramsey (Allan Jones) and Louise Hall (Mary Martin). Many of Herbert's most famous compositions are well in evidence, including \"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\", \"March of the Toys\" and \"Kiss Me Again\", the latter performed con brio by teenaged coloratura Susanna Foster. Evidently, the producers were able to secure the film rights for the Herbert songs, but not for the stage productions in which they appeared, which may explain such bizarre interpolations as having a song from Naughty Marietta.","popularity":0.9318,"poster_path":"/70IfyoC0Bjgqr9qT7RYnXXZVE5y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hear 28 Victor Herbert Melodies","title":"The Great Victor Herbert","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Jones","original_name":"Allan Jones","popularity":0.2371,"profile_path":"/m86mHhAbRSYPgxwAsjQbwMmQ0Cm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Ramsey","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Martin","original_name":"Mary Martin","popularity":0.3329,"profile_path":"/ubJAC2E0RVQqF6o2SlYLlkrayPt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Louise Hall","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Connolly","original_name":"Walter Connolly","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":"/mJB6tVqIlr5zhiSqCx2Vl0Kr6Nw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Victor Herbert","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Bowman","original_name":"Lee Bowman","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/tGHg7HLfnjtpLhYFZJSUSbTS2s2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Richard Moore","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Foster","original_name":"Susanna Foster","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/aQPSpqHzN7k0mc6Ce0KbR4tj6bM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Peggy","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":987037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Barrett","original_name":"Judith Barrett","popularity":0.4554,"profile_path":"/1FScZrwafKdj3woGBkl1JVWC3SM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie Clark","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Cowan","original_name":"Jerome Cowan","popularity":0.402,"profile_path":"/79be685su9LMAr41HMVKby0FsTg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Barney Harris","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186db","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":255745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Garrick","original_name":"John Garrick","popularity":0.2327,"profile_path":"/lU4IW6zThjvCEc3PeuBCuFQBtQ0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Warner Bryant","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186df","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Watkin","original_name":"Pierre Watkin","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/w36vNJFvQDiDyuC9zvT8nNZajhA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Albert Martin","credit_id":"52fe4e49c3a368484e2186e3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal K.
