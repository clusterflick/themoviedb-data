He begins looking for sponsors. He finds one with a department store owner who will only lend him the money if he will allow his daughter, an aspiring tap-dancer and singer, to perform on the air. This is unfortunate as she is tone-deaf. To compensate, the owner hires a real singer to dub the daughter's voice. The singer and the owner's nephew fall in love and mayhem ensues. Songs include: the Oscar nominated \"Who Am I?,\" \"Swing Low Sweet Rhythm,\" \"In The Cool of the Evening,\" \"Make Yourself at Home,\" \"The Swap Shop Song,\" \"The Trading Post,\" \"Sally,\" \"Ramona,\" \"Sweet Sue,\" \"Dinah,\" \"Margie,\" and \"Mary Lou.\"","popularity":1.3149,"poster_path":"/uCtpwrt0H784yuNbHve4n1wFrOw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ROMANCE ...
