The star is cast as Dixie Boy Johnson, who rises from the ranks of minstrel shows to become a top Broadway attraction. On the opening night of his greatest stage triumph, Dixie Boy's wife dies in childbirth. Profoundly shaken, he walks out of the show, leaving the baby to be raised by his showbiz pals Mae and Lasses White (Gladys George, Roscoe Karns). The kid grows up to be an attractive young woman named Caroline (Judy Clark), who follows in her dad's footsteps by billing herself as-that's right-Dixie Girl Johnson. This leads to a tearful reunion between Caroline and the father she'd long assumed to be dead. If Minstrel Man seems at times to be a dress rehearsal for Columbia's The Jolson Story (1946), it shouldn't surprising: the PRC film was directed by Joseph H. Lewis, who went on to helm Jolson Story's musical highlights.","popularity":0.8336,"poster_path":"/zoIQmINabP2QTdB21O7HDHzsl45.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minstrel Man","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Fields","original_name":"Benny Fields","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dixie Boy Johnson","credit_id":"56fd9cd79251417bca000206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys George","original_name":"Gladys George","popularity":0.1911,"profile_path":"/yniYGj7MqG13UZNLDQWh28RR6tK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mae White","credit_id":"56fd9ce1c3a368650100022c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Dinehart","original_name":"Alan Dinehart","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/61xlajAGLWffJOBasrKXgB0E6g2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lew Dunn","credit_id":"56fd9cec9251417bca000209","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe Karns","original_name":"Roscoe Karns","popularity":0.2759,"profile_path":"/eDXhkieC1icm4lGnuDziIIl5nO8.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lasses White","credit_id":"56fd9cf8c3a36864fa00021d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Cowan","original_name":"Jerome Cowan","popularity":0.402,"profile_path":"/79be685su9LMAr41HMVKby0FsTg.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bill Evans","credit_id":"56fd9d039251417bca00020d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Clark","original_name":"Judy Clark","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":"/1sw3YD7SMQ8DmFnc3AATqo4iUM4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Caroline Jr.-16 years old","credit_id":"5cf2e622925141247cbbe3b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Lamont","original_name":"Molly Lamont","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/4r64BWp2K9DMEDUT62ExIzCTk7s.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Caroline Johnson","credit_id":"5cf2e63bc3a3682e26213ed2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Raitt","original_name":"John Raitt","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/upsBk262wTxvceBApVKM94r4RpN.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Singer","credit_id":"5cf2e6470e0a2670bdcd768b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph H.
