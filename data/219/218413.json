Maria Corda, wife of the director, plays the title character as a fetchingly underdressed coquette, oblivious to all the political turmoil she's causing when she allows the handsome Paris (Ricardo Cortez) to kidnap her. Meanwhile, poor King Menelaus (Lewis Stone), Helen's husband, stands by in stoic silence, just as he's done on previous occasions when his wife succumbed to the charms of various sexy suitors (one of whom is played by future cowboy star \"Wild Bill\" Elliot). Finally galvanized into action, Menelaus reclaims his bride, who seems none the worse for wear for her experiences.","popularity":1.5328,"poster_path":"/mZft19Osx7lF4qgsRP4snsC8ofm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Private Life of Helen of Troy","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Stone","original_name":"Lewis Stone","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/wjIS8X6Smdbwb7CTQVyWelyZutk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Menelaus","credit_id":"53252fb892514117080014a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Cortez","original_name":"Ricardo Cortez","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/keRHNE7LFtrwnfJ6wTxrt4gyyxS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paris","credit_id":"53252fc092514115440013af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Fawcett","original_name":"George Fawcett","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/pZBmcj6XkdBkNKvUIovZMNqg8qU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Eteoneus","credit_id":"53252fcb9251410c87001435","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice White","original_name":"Alice White","popularity":0.2125,"profile_path":"/125HWIFPTLzVpyzBfZ7X6PwWfA1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Adraste","credit_id":"53252fd29251410c87001438","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Elliott","original_name":"Bill Elliott","popularity":0.2801,"profile_path":"/9Wafomp8j5p0CWnRXJWt6OlAg0m.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Telemachus","credit_id":"53252fde92514117080014ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom O'Brien","original_name":"Tom O'Brien","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/rytrfICKCiXI7hIYdHJYE0nSNQx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ulysses","credit_id":"53252fe8925141143900135a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Sprotte","original_name":"Bert Sprotte","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/tvVZs3dunBBfL32jPvHGHU5ujFU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Achilles","credit_id":"53252ff092514115440013b9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Károly Huszár","original_name":"Károly Huszár","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/rizeLJc34f3bvgdCvprqfBVP0G8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Malapokitoratoreadetos","credit_id":"53253010925141652a0011c0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1301248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Corda","original_name":"María Corda","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/fUMkMY5d3sYxSHKmrvP14Q85QJ4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"5325305692514115440013c2","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexander Korda","original_name":"Alexander Korda","popularity":0.1805,"profile_path":"/93uwIiQQLFilIkemBrjS2D4WgCQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e4cc3a368484e218fb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008623,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Horace Jackson","original_name":"Horace Jackson","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5c4d22c3a3684d8d87e6a5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017979","wikidata_id":"Q1169646","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mZft19Osx7lF4qgsRP4snsC8ofm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215678,"name":"partially lost film"},{"id":217043,"name":"fragment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
