Since then, he has been ceaselessly trying to unveil the chain of events that have resulted in dad's death. Marco contacts Raul Chinna, a well-known criminologist that has made the Dog's bloody legacy his very own field of expertise. As soon Marco and Chinna start to recall the past, they both have to face the fact there is another man obsessed by the murders of Crazy Dog: David Moiraghi, a journalist who's been working for decades on the serial killer. As the truth starts slowly to emerge from the mists of time, Marco has to acknowledge that there is maybe something more that links professor Chinna and Moiraghi. The thin line between truth and fiction starts slowly to blur while Marco is forced once again to face his worst nightmares all over again.","popularity":0.8367,"poster_path":"/rQpRIvDh7XaAAzR0Z50MZqWWYpg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy
