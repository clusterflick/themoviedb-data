His work, essentially composed of black and white engravings, is a cry of rebellion against the tragedies of his time. Forced into exile for his pacifist convictions, he embodied, alongside writers like Stefan Zweig and Romain Rolland, the dream of a cultural and brotherly Europe. Through an imaginary correspondence the director addresses to the artist, the film sketches the portrait of a free, touching man who, throughout his life, attempted to break free of art dealers and put his creations in the hands of all.","popularity":0.1106,"poster_path":"/nENIudzBhQjpPk3y3qYAxgRPyvM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74735,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBA","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":94970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du Verger","origin_country":""},{"id":87031,"logo_path":"/lXqLNf7ttr1AIchNgDh27ueMsPf.png","name":"Michigan Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":90917,"logo_path":"/svm1615RvI6FgW50ZewmyqhQWr7.png","name":"Supermouche Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les mains libres","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Laffont","original_name":"Jérôme Laffont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e199df0647c06629cb0c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Laffont","original_name":"Jérôme Laffont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e19b7f0647c000f9cef4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368092,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johan Legraie","original_name":"Johan Legraie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e1a4312197e000e492351","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7501254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nENIudzBhQjpPk3y3qYAxgRPyvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227302,"name":"portrait of an artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
