An explosion of artistic energy produced Pop Art, Minimalism, color-field painting, and hard-edged abstraction. Sculptors and painters on both coasts explored new methods and new subject matter. American Art in the Sixties examines the key figures of that decade including Rauschenberg and Johns, two crucial transitional figures between Abstract Expressionism and the sensibilities of the new decade. The art of that time mirrors the optimism and the affluence, and the technology and the vulgarity of those boom years.","popularity":0.3171,"poster_path":"/8LpsQ00KepK3HE0PCMEbQLAzbTp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Art in the 1960s","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cage","original_name":"John Cage","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/9gmtnfJV6dO81hNzxr2Nm3UGeNv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d7ec1732866fa54b338c532","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2411891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Frankenthaler","original_name":"Helen Frankenthaler","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nV2SfoknjpnE2JlEuVC3pDg3XWn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d7ec17e3c4344099ba131be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasper Johns","original_name":"Jasper Johns","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d7ec189f0647c5e0b9c1b60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2276312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Lichtenstein","original_name":"Roy Lichtenstein","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/kJscdRCdhdOaliQ1sdhze8TNy4d.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d7ec191f0647c5e0a9c1a16","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Rauschenberg","original_name":"Robert Rauschenberg","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d7ec19e2866fa54b338c555","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d7ec1a53c43440998a14125","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5d7ec1503c43440997a139b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Rose","original_name":"Barbara Rose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7ec15af0647c76299ca1e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1870325","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LpsQ00KepK3HE0PCMEbQLAzbTp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
