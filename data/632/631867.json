A Lebanese-American filmmaker photographs a woman in Paris: as a trapeze artist, a model, a lover, and a child. The film attempts to capture that moment between wakefulness and dream. It carries within it melancholy and loneliness, sadness and joy, adulthood and childhood. It evolves out of the metaphor that life is a circular journey whose end is \"to arrive at where we started / And know that place for the first time\" (T.S. Eliot, Little Gidding).","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/yLz0BTgoxFFPNCOlRS8aolCmgnJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hisham Bizri","original_name":"Hisham Bizri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d80981b2f266b002c876b80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1737072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yLz0BTgoxFFPNCOlRS8aolCmgnJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
