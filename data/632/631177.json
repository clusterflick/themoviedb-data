In Judenrein, meaning free of Jews, the director examines amateur footage of the 1980s in a small Polish village, rescued to find answers about his story, in a biographical reflection. In Levantados do Chão, a philharmonic band traverses an abandoned hotel in the Azores, and the emptiness left by the ruins thus refers to a past that is still present and prevalent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raised from the Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Blaufuks","original_name":"Daniel Blaufuks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7d1395069f0e73f1331992","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
