He cannot sleep. He keeps to himself, somewhat moody and savage. Life for him is a mystery and it impossible to understand, leading him into melancholic paralysis. His thoughts wander through the vastness of the desert, and at the same time force him to see himself powerless in his petty sphere of action, and powerless from the very mystery of his thought. The embitterment, callousness, grossness, brutality of his paralysis is imposed on his pure and noble soul, turning his life into a profound tragedy.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirocco","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hisham Bizri","original_name":"Hisham Bizri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8099211056110017d15f4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2339643","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
