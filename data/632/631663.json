Water made life possible in this \"stone wilderness,\" carved out the iconic Yosemite Valley, and gave birth to the Earth's largest living trees. But with climate change, Yosemite is feeling the heat. Water is scarcer and the threat of wildfire is more common. Join scientists and adventurers as they explore the past, present, and future of the Sierra Nevada's (a mountain range which stretches from California into Nevada through Yosemite) most precious resource, its water. Glide over the Yosemite Valley, climb trees as tall as buildings, and see how critters both great and small - from the bighorn sheep to the American pika - survive through drought, wildfire, and mountains of snow, as we investigate one of America's great wildernesses.","popularity":0.2037,"poster_path":"/sLmeBFleMuWAR8GIDmlNUO0QXUt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite","title":"Nature: Yosemite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Kline","original_name":"Kevin Kline","popularity":1.4282,"profile_path":"/ArH5dACd9AmWNNMnI6bGEkiFYIM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"主演","credit_id":"640857679f51af007c71f493","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Pontecorvo","original_name":"Joseph Pontecorvo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640857875e1200009fb0f361","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6720254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6OhXuCtrU18ZclSR7X7Ib0vCi5t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sLmeBFleMuWAR8GIDmlNUO0QXUt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":314373,"name":"约塞米蒂"},{"id":314374,"name":"国家公园"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
