The first girl he meets is actually a troubled prostitute named Champa whom he manages to rescue from the brothel she has been in for some time. He takes her home and in a most typical Hindi film style, announces her as his sister. Along with them lives a crippled middle-aged man. Ganga falls for a beautiful girl named Barkha, and her parents agree to have them married, but alas, Barkha's brother Rakesh identifies Champa and the marriage is cancelled as a result.","popularity":0.2759,"poster_path":"/uPrl2UHZT0qjthHtpvRcc00zF2L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1970-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pehchan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manoj Kumar","original_name":"Manoj Kumar","popularity":0.9433,"profile_path":"/tgVjgDkI9NlbcxsBZWW8LzfvNcr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gangaram 'Ganga' Ramkishan","credit_id":"604038d80fb398005ba264ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babita Kapoor","original_name":"Babita Kapoor","popularity":0.2804,"profile_path":"/dWZVnIbmrIHGeJCHFqVQBiHlL8H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Barkha","credit_id":"604038f7142ef100455001d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Balraj Sahni","original_name":"Balraj Sahni","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":"/hMgJ6agJtvsVdA7k6P6JJGl5Dcb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Baba","credit_id":"6040390541aac400442008f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chand Usmani","original_name":"Chand Usmani","popularity":0.2164,"profile_path":"/wSMvJvhnD6rZnHUSH3EBi4hYIq2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Champa","credit_id":"604039197e9d5f0028b2f53e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tun Tun","original_name":"Tun Tun","popularity":0.2397,"profile_path":"/y2ORD7WlbDnMVdlKbmq1dAMdeUm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ganga's prospective bride","credit_id":"6040392822e4800030f1c508","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brahm Bhardwaj","original_name":"Brahm Bhardwaj","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/ng5Unz35a74w67v8JtslohdXubF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Maya's Dad","credit_id":"604039367e9d5f0044e40f60","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.S.
