No? Well neither had a rather bemused Nick Briggs until he caught up with John Leeson on location for the Doctor Who drama Downtime. Ten years earlier, it was all a lot easier for Keith Harrison when he interviewed John for the second Myth Makers. Life was simple then, you just sat down and had a nice chat about life and being the voice of K9.  Now, you have to run around the inside of the Doctorâ€™s faithful robot companion, plus learn how to cook (and more importantly how to catch) a Yeti! Well these are the ingredients, its all been cooking in the oven, so take your seats for dinner. Confused...? Not half as much as Nick!","popularity":0.2153,"poster_path":"/kt3eFrJGajmXyHEPe9bob7z4DuJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 2: John Leeson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Myth Makers: John Leeson","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Leeson","original_name":"John Leeson","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/tmnsokNJvaXt6E5fvmTmcqoQJC5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d7e71b13c43440996a0edcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Briggs","original_name":"Nicholas Briggs","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/7QUxZVfw8WqUSxPVHrhmRtXGFUl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62ccf2b221eca6004f9427e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4302704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Harrison","original_name":"Keith Harrison","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651b1a9193bd6900c4e004e9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411633,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anthony Clark","original_name":"Anthony Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e725cda9ef20011a02589","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Vincent-Rudzki","original_name":"Jan Vincent-Rudzki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e71d312197e001149893c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Davies","original_name":"Kevin Davies","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":"/c408rtiDtJE34btDeO4U10oKMWk.jpg","credit_id":"5d7e71f812197e7fbe493c83","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187330,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Barnfather","original_name":"Keith Barnfather","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/nc5XBOgyj8cy4R6t4d9Ilf3Rl6h.jpg","credit_id":"5d7e71e512197e000e498521","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340425,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Ayres","original_name":"Mark Ayres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cZKMNWorQ7oODs0rrOuZTykAteL.jpg","credit_id":"67e6e02afa015f4a2c7677fb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kt3eFrJGajmXyHEPe9bob7z4DuJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Extended Edition","release_date":"1995-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
