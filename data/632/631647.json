She finds a grain of wheat, plants it, harvests the wheat crop, shucks the wheat, grinds it, and then bakes a loaf of bread. When the time comes for the bread to be eaten, the farm animals want a share of it, but all they get from the little red hen is a lecture about when there is bread to be baked, don't loaf on the job. This proves just how hard-working the little red hen really is...not many would do that much work just to be able to make a bad pun.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Red Hen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Rasinski","original_name":"Connie Rasinski","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f1e80c543040013966537","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151363","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
