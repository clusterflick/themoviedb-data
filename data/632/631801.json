In 1974, he joined the Japanese Red Army in Lebanon, which worked closely with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Filmmaker Lutz Dammbeck met Adachi in Tokyo in 2018 and talked with him about a wide range of topics, including art, revolution, the influence of western avant-garde art and American underground; the Japanese Red Army; collaboration with secret services; the role of the Left after 1968; and the reasons for failures of leftist ideas and strategies.","popularity":0.2304,"poster_path":"/l2IVuIqw1H0hxVtYMavKG700URx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruno & Bettina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Bruno und Bettina","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134812,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masao Adachi","original_name":"足立正生","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/zKVZDV6EJhAVeYoAXIbnAsjAPMc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d7ff64e21118f00266ffff4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5d7ff626105611001fd0c11d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5e55e3e535811d00135bf078","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25646,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yutaka Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎裕","popularity":0.2067,"profile_path":"/gW8dR1Tb06MVqqG9e8Cayym4OBy.jpg","credit_id":"5e55e549a93d2500134fd87a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5e55e5d41e92250018200197","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"5e55e5e0a93d25001a4ff934","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2IVuIqw1H0hxVtYMavKG700URx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":239548,"name":"left politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
