When Ophelia consents to Dr. Bloom inducing sleep to analyze her lucid dreams, she finds herself confronted by the deepest recesses of her psyche and licentious urges. Ophelia’s dreamscape appears to descend into the occult, and a game of dice reveals that her sexual compulsions may be more difficult to suppress than she could have ever imagined. In her dream, Ophelia finds herself in a hospital where temptation arises in the form of Clarence, a seemingly benign orderly, and fellow patients Jasmine and Rose. When Ophelia wakes up in Dr. Bloom’s office, she starts to probe deeper into the roots of her desires. However, items, symbols, and figures from her vivid, surreal dream start to appear, and Dr. Bloom’s husband, Gabriel, plants the seed in Ophelia that she should give in to her untreatable nymphomania.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7lT5u2xpus9wtsaOuD6vewJPyr1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6112,"logo_path":"/wWrRC80656YYP4QqRqcUkdb99xN.png","name":"Digital Playground","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Deep inside the most lucid of dreams","title":"Untreatable","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1997424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kendra Spade","original_name":"Kendra Spade","popularity":16.172,"profile_path":"/roQHjEitd8nWWjAPNOHeO2tn7JJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ophelia","credit_id":"5d7db6d42866fa00123920a3","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":142010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chanel Preston","original_name":"Chanel Preston","popularity":88.154,"profile_path":"/3MCvRf4BnouDANL4zBaH5TIfWTO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Charlotte Bloom","credit_id":"5d7db6e13c43440010a1156c","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1426816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenna James","original_name":"Kenna James","popularity":36.808,"profile_path":"/dDNKmAQVdiV0tyI7cYpU1RxhImf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jasmine","credit_id":"5d7db6f62866fa0013392175","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1829176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofi Ryan","original_name":"Sofi Ryan","popularity":5.317,"profile_path":"/htsOFa2k4zguDX4OY7g05iXskn8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"5d7db7003c43440011a11e67","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":132144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Gamble","original_name":"Seth Gamble","popularity":12.937,"profile_path":"/2sf8yOXitROq76irW5Avmj5GpKL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clarence","credit_id":"5d7db71bf0647c06629c18ec","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":563723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xander Corvus","original_name":"Xander Corvus","popularity":11.312,"profile_path":"/8JVCcHHVTaGsxF3XCR8Kmt1IODa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gabriel Bloom","credit_id":"5d7db721f0647c000f9c6473","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10988864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7lT5u2xpus9wtsaOuD6vewJPyr1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
