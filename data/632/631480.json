That’s where an 11-year-old boy spends his last month of summer. Fascinated by stories about the Wild West and haunted by the religious imagery in church, he craves adventure. As he explores the surroundings, equipped with a cassette recorder and a bow, his innocent adventure suddenly stops being child’s play.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/yS5uQtJCeWgNtUzSYlPnC2J0Lva.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88672,"logo_path":"/meFXC1APvM2kb6nxpOhHF1I9w9G.png","name":"Animoon","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
