Their throats were cut and their bodies horribly mutilated. He was never caught and his identity remains one of the world's greatest crime mysteries. In the years that have passed since Jack the Ripper's killing spree, many high-profile suspects have been suggested, yet the fact remains that none of them can be placed at any of the crime scenes. Now, journalist Christer Holmgren believes that he has found a suspect who can not only be linked directly to one of the murders but also whose daily routine could be consistent with all the other deaths","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/iaKAJx1zxlR0bJzmkgOCrsLYlwz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27856,"logo_path":"/jLMbth7gIW0UMxGqHB5zuHk1iJk.png","name":"Channel 5","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack the Ripper: The Missing Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Mackintosh","original_name":"Steven Mackintosh","popularity":0.7375,"profile_path":"/vDA4mmVe0XMnqd6qMyGWI8bUEeC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5d7e4e5112197e000e496375","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Ingram","original_name":"Arthur Ingram","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d7e4f2312197e7fbe4914a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Payne-James","original_name":"Jason Payne-James","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d7e4f37f0647c5e0c9baa31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3448783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christer Holmgren","original_name":"Christer Holmgren","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Journalist","credit_id":"621e65ea5c3247006d4bd84b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1212940,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Vandervelde","original_name":"John Vandervelde","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e4ea62866fa001239f382","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Taplin","original_name":"Sam Taplin","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e4e17f0647c5e0c9ba8d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Pupp","original_name":"Martin Pupp","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e4e2d3c43440010a1e34b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgia Braham","original_name":"Georgia Braham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e4ecff0647c5e0a9bab14","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":63800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqueline Kelly","original_name":"Jacqueline Kelly","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e4e8e12197e000e4963ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dan Chambers","original_name":"Dan Chambers","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7e4ee812197e7fbc4913be","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4214840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iaKAJx1zxlR0bJzmkgOCrsLYlwz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":4007,"name":"jack the ripper"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"},{"id":40921,"name":"street crime"},{"id":193264,"name":"english police"},{"id":220522,"name":"unsolved crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
