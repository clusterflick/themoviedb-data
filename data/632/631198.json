He brought only music recorded tapes. He wants to write on music, the main question being for him: what represents music for man? He tells eight experiments done in different places or occasions (in a car, at the opera, at a rock gig, listening a walkman,..). He expresses how the way you are listening can affect your feelings and reflection. His voice and his written words appearing on screen are the mental counterpoint of silent images.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Musique sans cesse et table rase","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Sarrut","original_name":"Bernard Sarrut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7d2a652866fa0012385829","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
