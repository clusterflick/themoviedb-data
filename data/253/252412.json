The main focus of the film begins with extended footage of the Gothic splendor of Nüremberg from the air, Hitler's arrival at the airbase, his motorcade into the city, and the ensuing ceremonies. Other, much more propagandistic elements, are edited in; they include: past Nazi party marches and rallies, parachute drops, Wehrmacht exercises in the Zeppelin fields, random military formation night rallies and random shots of massed crowds, fireworks, torch lit marches, even live explosions.","popularity":0.3977,"poster_path":"/2osgWXRJk4vPPRrqr18uyWl7zJh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festive Nuremberg","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Festive Nuremberg","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e3e9251416c9112b2cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1255425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Göring","original_name":"Hermann Göring","popularity":0.2762,"profile_path":"/srlxYR4WbfBH4KpoBptWSRduqTO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5aaeff59c3a36846ba030a3d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Weidemann","original_name":"Hans Weidemann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e3e9251416c9112b2cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0499474","wikidata_id":"Q828539","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2osgWXRJk4vPPRrqr18uyWl7zJh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
