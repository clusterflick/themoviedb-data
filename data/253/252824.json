For one thing, Al is appallingly dependent on Elsa for his every emotional need. For another, Elsa is an incredibly elusive person, extremely difficult to pin down about anything - especially whatever is bothering her. How they have managed to survive this long is a cause for wonder. When Al gets an opportunity to be cast in a movie role, complete with no-cost occupancy in the casting agent's ugly but fashionable apartment, he jumps at the chance to provide a little material satisfaction for his beloved Elsa. But what exactly does she want?","popularity":0.6621,"poster_path":"/g9pWDYpJ4PJbIH8fuyfpSvuSgPC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orly
