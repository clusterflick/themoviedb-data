First we see agricultural statistics: the far-away village of Miggershausen is quite below standards in milk and egg production. An anthropomorphic radio undertakes the long voyage by express train, steam train, hay carriage to Miggershausen to advertise its services. It is not well received. Then, it collects and leads an army of radios to try again. They flood all the farmhouses and seem to be more convincing that way - at day, they spread agricultural knowledge to bring milk and egg production up to standards; later, they just play music and illustrate how various people enjoy various kinds of music.","popularity":0.2713,"poster_path":"/pHAaHnKNRwLoVJv0u51FMK0psEG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commerz-Film AG (Berlin)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle for Miggershausen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Goedecke","original_name":"Heinz Goedecke","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ff8e7230c1255003eefdee9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Woelz","original_name":"Georg Woelz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e3e9251416c9112b2eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928643,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Schwärzel","original_name":"Paul Schwärzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8e778a0be2800418cab62","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928643,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Schwärzel","original_name":"Paul Schwärzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8e7836c0b36003ea49f89","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928644,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Georg Woelz","original_name":"Georg Woelz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8e7bcdd83fa00406cbce6","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2928645,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl Sezuka","original_name":"Karl Sezuka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8e7cd6c0b36003ca4d8a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0178015","wikidata_id":"Q24905048","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pHAaHnKNRwLoVJv0u51FMK0psEG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":972}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":210094,"name":"nazi propaganda"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
