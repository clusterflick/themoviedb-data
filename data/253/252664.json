They grew up on a North Carolina college campus, the daughters of the first African-American Episcopal bishop, who was born a slave, and a woman with an inter-racial background. With the support of each other and their family, they survived encounters with racism and sexism in their own different ways. Sadie quietly and sweetly broke barriers to become the first African-American home-ec teacher in New York City, while Bessie, with her own brand of outspokenness, became the second African-American dentist in New York City. At the ages of 103 and 101, they told their story to Amy Hill Hearth, a white New York Times reporter who published an article about them. The overwhelming response launched a bestselling book, a Broadway play, and this film.","popularity":2.4964,"poster_path":"/32r7ZkMlisk0Qmmhj7sKIwRvPel.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Having Our Say","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diahann Carroll","original_name":"Diahann Carroll","popularity":0.5741,"profile_path":"/7LrrYWQykcL0mFaGhXshwVCoByZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sadie Delany","credit_id":"5622c4e5c3a3680e1000bcb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruby Dee","original_name":"Ruby Dee","popularity":0.7793,"profile_path":"/eRRRVQTLkH3RU9inzRHJqWdIZkW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Annie Elizabeth 'Bessie' Delany","credit_id":"5622c4cfc3a3680e1d00c8f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Madigan","original_name":"Amy Madigan","popularity":0.9591,"profile_path":"/6veWp9aOoo9dueAqlkljQ2lFcjz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Amy Hill Hearth","credit_id":"5622c4f492514127d4000d4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Arrindell","original_name":"Lisa Arrindell","popularity":0.4768,"profile_path":"/zHHOTp6qt0grtnwFdKbZ2ZZYM4l.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sadie in her 20s","credit_id":"5622c50d92514171c500c002","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":187565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audra McDonald","original_name":"Audra McDonald","popularity":0.6513,"profile_path":"/3YpPMKnhljAJwgcaFfHGNkL0rcv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bessie in her 20s","credit_id":"5622c518c3a3680e0e00cbac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mykelti Williamson","original_name":"Mykelti Williamson","popularity":1.3879,"profile_path":"/dR16zD9AjnHWbeN5OVmJWE0vSax.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Papa Delany","credit_id":"661347d5048638017c19d038","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lonette McKee","original_name":"Lonette McKee","popularity":0.6119,"profile_path":"/pNfZLPHYfTbeq4l5SgfjJ0XCew5.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mama Delany","credit_id":"661347e8ac617c014ab03f31","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Roundtree","original_name":"Richard Roundtree","popularity":0.7254,"profile_path":"/wPuLgW8PrzJFBrfsB03oon5MT7f.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Booker T.
