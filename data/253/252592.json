Kramer’s confronting film is an essay about the sticky complicity of everyone present at this event, each bringing their own history, their own political ideology, their own desires to take revenge, to seek redemption or compassion, or just to put their heads down and ‘get the job done’ professionally, or (in the case of Filbert) to be a star, a part of the magnificent, magical, seductive world of cinema, even if it kills him.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/rW26wE8MEExRK01oDcN4H4Q9iYX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quasar Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Nazi","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Unsere Nazi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Filbert","original_name":"Alfred Filbert","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65bc52f5cffeed017caebbd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henri Alekan","original_name":"Henri Alekan","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/rL2bZDa889sNXZOxfPwieE9ZzBb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Harlan","original_name":"Thomas Harlan","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":"/98rH0mWwVXQpk6w13Dz6U8LyN70.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heike Geschonneck","original_name":"Heike Geschonneck","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9e1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Harlan","original_name":"Thomas Harlan","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":"/98rH0mWwVXQpk6w13Dz6U8LyN70.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120714,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yasha Aginsky","original_name":"Yasha Aginsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/io1wbDusszajYejOgShBD0vOk3l.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c9112c9d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henri Alekan","original_name":"Henri Alekan","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/rL2bZDa889sNXZOxfPwieE9ZzBb.jpg","credit_id":"54f8b93fc3a36834a2004605","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","credit_id":"54f8bbd79251416f6e0048c1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0087860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1158,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rW26wE8MEExRK01oDcN4H4Q9iYX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/oGJ3EQki7gKbY8rcKr1CAfj49XT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
