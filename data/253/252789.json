The \"star attraction\" here, as far as I'm concerned, is the ballad \"Agnes\", probably an original song by Philip A. Scheib (during a period when they were working hard to introduce them in these films; \"Gypsy Life\" being the only one anyone remembers). The scenes with the couple on a bicycle was an early one by \"Connie\" Rasinski, exhibiting his learning from Bill Tytla. The shot with the cats walking down the aisle is by a staffer whose animation was full of awkwardness and errors, but was also ambitious and charming.","popularity":0.068,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A June Bride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Moser","original_name":"Frank Moser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e559251416c9112e1db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Terry","original_name":"Paul Terry","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/9nUH3iMaImOynJyXfo11Hp8b4q4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e559251416c9112e1e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151159","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
