While the brain can seem almost boundless in its potential, it has limitations, such as processing speed, attentional limitations, working memory limitations, and sensitivity to interference, which can be both internal and external. Dr. Gazzaley explores the impact that multi-tasking has on our safety, memory, education, careers and personal lives. Most importantly, The Distracted Mind tells us what we can do to improve our attentional abilities and our focus as we age, and as media continues to dominate our landscape. From changing our behaviors, to literally changing our brains, Dr. Gazzaley shares information you need to survive and thrive in the information age.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Santa Fe Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Attention, Distraction and the Myth of Multi-Tasking","title":"The Distracted Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818686,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dr Adam Gazzaley","original_name":"Dr Adam Gazzaley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Host","credit_id":"591c726dc3a3687a4b00bdea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818687,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Tiano","original_name":"Anthony Tiano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c72c0925141485e00cfff","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818686,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dr Adam Gazzaley","original_name":"Dr Adam Gazzaley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c733ec3a3687a4b00be8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818686,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dr Adam Gazzaley","original_name":"Dr Adam Gazzaley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c729a9251414a5700bf84","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lennlee Keep","original_name":"Lennlee Keep","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"591c7316c3a368774e00d0bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Hoppin","original_name":"Jim Hoppin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f34e17d93828e00343d76ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3044684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
