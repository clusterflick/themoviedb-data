The film depicts the life and reign of Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich of Kiev, known in legends as Vladimir the Red Sun. The story begins in 972 AD, after the death of his father, Grand Prince Svyatoslav, which ignites a power struggle among Vladimir and his brothers.  The film emphasizes that Russian princes only succeeded when they maintained good relations with the Bulgars and other steppe nations. It also depicts Vladimir's reflection on his rise to power upon receiving the book \"The Ladder\" in 1005, ten years after his conversion to Christianity.","popularity":0.2679,"poster_path":"/ph1WVDjQpBwSZ9bWT4xa4Vs4s8U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Council of Ministers of
