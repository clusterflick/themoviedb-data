'Sparky\" was the dog who was responsible for the Interstate Commerce Commission passing a special ruling allowing guide-dogs to travel first-class in Pullman cars to accompany their blind partner, and not as animals confined to the baggage car. Smith shows how 'Sparky' went to Washington D. C. with his master and helped sell the change to the legislators.","popularity":0.3565,"poster_path":"/gNF5qay8W3mCIEjeJFRoOWsQJT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friend Indeed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4e309251416c91129577","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Gordon","original_name":"Mary Gordon","popularity":0.1986,"profile_path":"/5jhUhQa0ArqB8p5cr8EwIXNeihx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Housekeeper","credit_id":"52fe4e309251416c9112957b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Zinnemann","original_name":"Fred Zinnemann","popularity":0.2838,"profile_path":"/3x1xznQnnzVZNDdCkOcxuZ5CaQ0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e309251416c91129573","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0189535","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gNF5qay8W3mCIEjeJFRoOWsQJT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1797,"name":"loyalty"},{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
