Instead of modeling objects of human imagination the realm of mathematics is explored. Only the variables of one formula (x[n+1]=x[n]^p-c) were changed. It took me about a year to get an idea of the transformations and shapes which could be expressed by this formula. Almost another year was needed to render the sequences which I decided to use.","popularity":0.0411,"poster_path":"/7KSGaawZ07nf26oYf4iDOWL9RsV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gestalt","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thorsten Fleisch","original_name":"Thorsten Fleisch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/t8I8p9o0s2yC8vgC9YL9uOFA7pS.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e379251416c9112a3f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KSGaawZ07nf26oYf4iDOWL9RsV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
