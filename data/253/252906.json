Built in the 17th century by the Great Mogul Shah Jahan in honor of Mumtaz Mahal, the love of his life. Before she died, legend says, Mumtaz Mahal made a wish for a mausoleum, more sublime than any the world had seen. Built on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, it is said to have required over 20,000 workers including the best craftsmen of the Empire. Millions of bricks were baked on site only to disappear forever under flawless white marble. A heavenly memorial to the Queen of the World, or as a poet described it: \"A teardrop on the cheek of time\". A love poem set in stone and the most perfect building in the world.","popularity":0.1276,"poster_path":"/xuRI8WYslBIWjqSOFZZ5D1PrYYs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets of the Taj Mahal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Solomon","original_name":"Andrew Solomon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f13d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2552367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richa Meena","original_name":"Richa Meena","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mumtaz Mahal","credit_id":"634db3e4ec0c580090173129","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288272,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Hogh","original_name":"Alexander Hogh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f155","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288274,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Van Ooyen","original_name":"Joseph Van Ooyen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f161","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Koester","original_name":"Stephan Koester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f14f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288277,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernhard Von Dadelsen","original_name":"Bernhard Von Dadelsen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f173","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288273,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Cimbollek","original_name":"Nick Cimbollek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f15b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kurian","original_name":"George Kurian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f16d","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Art Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Koester","original_name":"Stephan Koester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288275,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ralf Grabowski","original_name":"Ralf Grabowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f167","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069498,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madeleine Carter","original_name":"Madeleine Carter","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f179","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288271,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Feyerabend","original_name":"Christian Feyerabend","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e5c9251416c9112f149","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2815706","wikidata_id":"Q51540857","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nd7LURgv75xCzwMLGFTiguDA1Y7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHjhLWaYDJgACduKfrtRy4t0bNS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xuRI8WYslBIWjqSOFZZ5D1PrYYs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
