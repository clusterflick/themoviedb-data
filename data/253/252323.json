(Bugliosi is the L.A. prosecutor that put Charles Manson away.) On December 11, 1966, a murder occurs in a small neighborhood of El Sereno, CA. In the middle of the night, Henry Stockton is shot three times in the head and twice in the chest and then his house is set on fire. The murderer left no clues, baffling the police, until a year later when a young pregnant woman is found bludgeoned to death in a Jaguar. Strangely, these two murders are related. As the mystery unfolds a horrific tale of greed, lust and ambition are revealed.","popularity":2.0219,"poster_path":"/f2GRerJ63UxzZOm9rQdjmAZ9hsb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scherick Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saban International","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Till Death Us Do Part","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Married for Murder","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Till Death Do Us Part","type":"VHS"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Treat Williams","original_name":"Treat Williams","popularity":1.3039,"profile_path":"/jbRMOU2K7ePg7Zs59nfgEYLeD1e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alan Palliko","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a72f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arliss Howard","original_name":"Arliss Howard","popularity":0.6714,"profile_path":"/28bQJ5fqLem4Ml7x9LZ7QEnwaTa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vincent Bugliosi","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a733","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Jenkins","original_name":"Rebecca Jenkins","popularity":0.3208,"profile_path":"/2nKLUX3KseptNMdYyGkrjGgxrsQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sandra Stockton","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a737","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pruitt Taylor Vince","original_name":"Pruitt Taylor Vince","popularity":0.9403,"profile_path":"/jqC1v8tF92QcmkQycnaLSuJiQfl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Michael Brockington","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a73b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Norris","original_name":"Dean Norris","popularity":2.6988,"profile_path":"/cchkQH3DRrvwFYocx7TxyfIDAAr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Matt Hobert","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a73f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Judd","original_name":"Ashley Judd","popularity":3.3881,"profile_path":"/5771ZxVIs5rQbI1SV8TOlAFcF15.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gwen Fox","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a743","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Schiff","original_name":"Richard Schiff","popularity":1.1496,"profile_path":"/oFDka3Y5H3DBiZRqbdPabtX8ncP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jack Wells","credit_id":"52fe4e399251416c9112a747","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.E.
