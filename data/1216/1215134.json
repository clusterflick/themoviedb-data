It is one of the earliest English anime dubs, as well as one of the first hentai anime English dubs ever produced. However, most of the dub's credits remain undisclosed to the public.  The English dub was produced in 1986 by adult film production company Excalibur Films. It was released alongside Cream Lemon and Ome-1 as part of the company's Brothers Grime X-Rated Cartoons series, which had three straight-to-video releases.  Telepathist Ai-Q 315 appeared on the first of these three videos, renamed as \"Search for Uranus\".  The English dub takes many liberties with the script and editing, but overall, retains the original plot and original soundtrack.","popularity":0.2048,"poster_path":"/fJjoXFvmerpxsPZj6EnnMXFcoJ1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Telepathist Ai-Q 315","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"テレパシスト愛Q315","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Terepashisuto Ai Kyuu Sa-I-Ko","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Terepashisuto ai Q 315 (saiko)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"IQ Pshyco","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Little Mermaid Series Volume 2","type":"anthology series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Telepathist AI Q315 Saiko","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Synphony Yume Monogatari","type":"reissue title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arisa Andô","original_name":"Arisa Andô","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6572e79cc4f55200c94e4bec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narumi Tsunoda","original_name":"Narumi Tsunoda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6572e7a7caab6d014d8454a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Banjo Ginga","original_name":"銀河万丈","popularity":1.1856,"profile_path":"/qiXnKaZheMiVyA1U2mX9tPdNA3T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6572e86a945c20014d8b8e52","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arthur King","original_name":"Arthur King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6572e80b006b0100c4346af8","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Satoshi Harada","original_name":"Satoshi Harada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e3b460db72c00163f57029","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14358692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fJjoXFvmerpxsPZj6EnnMXFcoJ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1985-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
