Their expedition took them from Mediterranean Algiers through the Sahara and parts of the African west coast to the Congo and Kenya. Not only did the couple explore vast stretches of land that were almost completely unknown, at least to private travelers at the time, they also captured this journey on film. A screenable documentary film was compiled from the original 12,000m of film material. In cinemas and film clubs, European audiences were presented with a film that was evidently able to satisfy an interest in foreign, 'wild' cultures and exotic landscapes, albeit one that was always Eurocentric. The spectacular shots of African lifestyles and nature, which in many respects were new to European viewers who were almost completely unfamiliar with Africa, were praised and appreciated precisely because of their supposed authenticity.","popularity":0.1987,"poster_path":"/miVqjDIuNqYegZHXnjdR2LupNCD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wilhelm Eggert Film","origin_country":""},{"id":28938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schongerfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Safari - Mit Wilhelm Eggert quer durch Afrika","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2852246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Hartung","original_name":"Erwin Hartung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65739fd6c4f552012cc7b16a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420270,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dora Eggert-Kuser","original_name":"Dora Eggert-Kuser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65739fe51c635b00ab1be087","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420270,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dora Eggert-Kuser","original_name":"Dora Eggert-Kuser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65739fea55bc350139898a96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420271,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wilhelm Eggert","original_name":"Wilhelm Eggert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65739ff69a358d01001052e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420271,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wilhelm Eggert","original_name":"Wilhelm Eggert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6573a0001c635b013764bd97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420271,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wilhelm Eggert","original_name":"Wilhelm Eggert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6573a005d5ffcb00ad88bffa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420271,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wilhelm Eggert","original_name":"Wilhelm Eggert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6573a00b1c635b00e0487737","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1876770,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Walter Winnig","original_name":"Walter Winnig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6573a0171c635b00ab1be091","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0490303","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":757,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/miVqjDIuNqYegZHXnjdR2LupNCD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":505}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":3513,"name":"safari"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
