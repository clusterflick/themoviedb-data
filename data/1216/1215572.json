The uneasiness of a new world and the terror of colonisation and subsequent slavery give way to peace in the city where all the ingredients blend together (European, African, Amerindian) and, finally, integration in the ecstasy of dance. After his death, around a sidereal oak tree, the sounds of the two continents come together.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/q1BffS2IVTDJzX9zgTcFoWum8Ji.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215567,"logo_path":null,"name":"piensan las manos","origin_country":""},{"id":215568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldstein y Steinberg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No ámbito do Cauca","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4421008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marlene Anaya","original_name":"Marlene Anaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65744f05bbe1dd0138cf32d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617594,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"María Steinberg","original_name":"María Steinberg","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65744f937a3c5200ca78b5cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chus Domínguez","original_name":"Chus Domínguez","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/pTiw4klHoBpXzjctIujA1Z599HH.jpg","credit_id":"65744f0ce93e9501001fa955","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436790,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marino García","original_name":"Marino García","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65744f247a3c5200ebfd035b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4421011,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carlos H.
