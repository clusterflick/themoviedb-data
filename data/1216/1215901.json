Moving between her early years growing up in Berlin, to her memories of East Germany, art school, and her current exhibition at the institution.\r Her practice is based on American artist Dan Graham (who created the Cafe Bravo installation at KW), but imagined as if he was born in Berlin in 1942 instead of Illinois. Here, Graham's artistic preoccupation with materiality and space is tied together with the weight of history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5sWet8QQohss7BIoDKUktRxvarF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215648,"logo_path":null,"name":"KW Berlin","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Mirror (2042 Retrospective)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4422417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Mende","original_name":"Nina Mende","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"65755dfca84a4700e1e23edf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"65755dc1bbe1dd00fe2b5347","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"65755dcfcadb6b081127980e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"65755dcabbe1dd00ac7c7ad1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"CG Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4422417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Mende","original_name":"Nina Mende","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65755ded89d97f013ac8e01e","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"65755db9a84a4700e1e23ebd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LJeRQeeISWHn9DCZhsaB9R68Cc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k3eIXcLd6DOkAxhubq1u9FGxp3H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cSJkVQGcHVqtPOPLTquN07SiQ70.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWoYc5zn676Eym2IhoSkisUCekq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqLShmDTZ7ouoGtEcpbU1hoWE6j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A2HH2b71iSfjf8iLqw0ZCEdxKHM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3iYyviRkWQKn2lP5Ox9vXTLIBA9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h9uy1u7wq5qQnWJZdFF4QzKnSs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v0Liaz7wknGYaUuRxmukOGa6WZf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":978,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5sWet8QQohss7BIoDKUktRxvarF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":652}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KW Berlin","release_date":"2016-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KW Berlin","release_date":"2016-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Berlin Mirror (2042 Retrospective)","key":"154969089","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-02-11T10:43:46.000Z","id":"65755e34cadb6b08104dff95"}]}}}
