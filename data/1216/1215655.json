Here, a new narrative is composed; sometimes in conjunction, sometimes in disjunction, with the original mise-en-scène. The viewer sees a man and a woman who have been thrown into a yard. The two characters develop slowly; they move away from each other, they look at each other. A cruel and obsessive game is played.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/b8cGvHdnu1q0hlgi3QJtm4UtlN5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quintal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernardo Zanotta","original_name":"Bernardo Zanotta","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6574929bbbe1dd011b8f88e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b8cGvHdnu1q0hlgi3QJtm4UtlN5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
