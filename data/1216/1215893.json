Designed and built amid the social and industrial upheaval of the 1960s, the luxury liner returns to a city undergoing extensive change under the auspices of urban regeneration.  From its moorings in Dubai, the ship passes through the Suez Canal, encountering refugee boats in the Mediterranean, oil rigs in the North Sea, disused shipyards on the Clyde and emerging artist enclaves in Glasgow. A soundtrack by cellist and composer Oliver Coates accompanies the ship on its final European cruise.  Continuing Lekâ€™s use of architectural media as a means of social critique, this site-specific simulation transforms the QE2 from a symbol of heavy industry into an institution for art.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/fRJAWhnvene45PvPUTzozAXe6GJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"QE3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4422392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Riach","original_name":"Amy Riach","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"65755850bbe1dd0138cf8344","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3081943,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Coates","original_name":"Oliver Coates","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/753HeW8vbkPR3kbyJSBFa5CRA67.jpg","credit_id":"6575580be93e9500e3756bca","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"657557f7c6006d011f0d84b5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"CG Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4422390,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Robin Simpson","original_name":"Robin Simpson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657558417a3c5200ad1882e4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"CG Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"657557e6a84a47011b603d0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Lek","original_name":"Lawrence Lek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fS0ygyXvbwPPxsMDU2VOJ3IDHS5.jpg","credit_id":"657557f0c6006d00c8751c70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Op2RkhNYwZIDwg5YVCGgpGecax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aHEUGsrLnKTvSZATzxI91OFXzCn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dSmzwkESEo5HQP6KAsqlt3RCZ8A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ibU82Yqq78JQVWvMxqrpXhvNRa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5YuZ0P44TMMIXkDxp0uMnNdsD9N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sSjwDrH5mfCxBtPnDoNFFeLDGEP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xh5TfOUnTaJQBuAOxkCJEcyvYoJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uW3PtzNvya5sEEhifA03QG9xNKs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbe5DEpAkihsQ3ZdTvWKovo7UDS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrMHKrNMIXPWUDH7UlIuZhBec4D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/goqMKKkge0fNnlOTjjpGbhUngVe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rIl4y0LFyYK8CHdxmmNK28jEfJ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fRJAWhnvene45PvPUTzozAXe6GJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Glasgow International","release_date":"2016-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"QE3 - Trailer - Glasgow International 2016","key":"161411544","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-04T00:47:32.000Z","id":"65755866a84a4700fe0e46ee"}]}}}
