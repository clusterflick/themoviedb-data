This time we are accompanying, among others, 17-year-old Munich surfer Ben Neumann. He proves that it is not only the sea that sometimes seems limitless, but also the human will. Ben is blind and not surfing the famous Eisbach wave is not an option for him. The three Australians Madison Stewart, Alice Forrest and Jordyn de Boer also want to cross borders. They are environmental activists and have one goal: to protect the oceans and their flora and fauna. In \"The Power of Activism\", they prove that this can also be economically viable and show a possible path into the future of activism. The fact that this future must begin now is impressively demonstrated by the film \"Stolen Fish\", which tells the story of two Gambian fishermen and a Gambian fish seller. All three are struggling with overfishing off the West African coast. A story about cause and effect and the associated search for a better life.","popularity":0.2663,"poster_path":"/zeMQbEHYnYaOWngxjsOoBrrAg5e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE film event is back for everyone who loves the sea and wants \"sea\": more heart, more depth, more water","title":"International OCEAN FILM TOUR Vol. 9","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madison Stewart","original_name":"Madison Stewart","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"6575c173a1d33200e1b79059","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordyn de Boer","original_name":"Jordyn de Boer","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"6575c190a1d3320138ea4301","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Forrest","original_name":"Alice Forrest","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"6575c19ebbe1dd00fe2b6e9e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsten Armstrong","original_name":"Kirsten Armstrong","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"6575c1a9a84a472de407636c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Pasvolsky","original_name":"Steve Pasvolsky","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6575c152ec370c013aed9e6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Pasvolsky","original_name":"Steve Pasvolsky","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6575c1efec8a430137fed18f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vxv29ZRdprpPJtNGGGRqJAk1InX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zeMQbEHYnYaOWngxjsOoBrrAg5e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213971,"name":"activism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"International OCEAN FILM TOUR Volume 9 | Official Trailer","key":"VLAGWS9XLbs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-01T08:47:58.000Z","id":"6575c256ec8a4300fd7d23f2"}]}}}
