Sunday October 11, 1992 Bring your grief and rage about AIDS to a Political Funeral in Washington DC. You have lost someone to AIDS. For more than a decade, your government has mocked your loss. You have spoken out in anger, joined political protests, carried fake coffins and mock tombstones, and splattered red paint to represent someone's HIV-positive blood, perhaps your own. George Bush believes that the White House gates shield him, from you, your loss, and his responsibility for the AIDS crisis. Now it is time to bring AIDS home to George Bush. On October 11th, we will carry the actual ashes of people we love in funeral procession to the White House. In an act of grief and rage and love, we will deposit their ashes on the White House lawn. Join us to protest twelve years of genocidal AIDS policy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dF7nftjm3iUU6cFxiZLOfFt0knU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ashes Action","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420886,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Schabel","original_name":"John Schabel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743b20a84a4700fe0de249","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Wentzy","original_name":"James Wentzy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743af9e93e95013a229a4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420887,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shraga Lev","original_name":"Shraga Lev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743b33d400f3010b060392","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420889,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew Chang","original_name":"Andrew Chang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743b4ba84a470138216158","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Wentzy","original_name":"James Wentzy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743ae3d400f300ad909d7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420890,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Arena","original_name":"Tony Arena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743b61a1d33200acb82575","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420892,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gloria G.
