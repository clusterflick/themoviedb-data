Ken Walsh (Steve Brown) still thinks that childhood murderer Thomas Sinclair is behind the killings and reckless sheriff Wesley Johnson (Robert Baker) attempts to internally redeem himself for his irresponsible actions. Meanwhile, Katie Brandon mourns the loss of her brother Russell and Shawn Ellison attempts to discover why he seems to be the target. Director/writer Anthony Spadaccini brings you an exercise in gratuitous gore (death by knife, pitchfork, hockey stick, etc), with another creepy music score and some truly shocking revelations.","popularity":0.2246,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleet Street
