For most families producing Moonshine was a prerequisite. Kitee became one of the most remarkable producers - both in good and bad. According to an 85-year old police officer, in the 1960s there were no villages that were not producing Moonshine. Yet, the city mayor of Kitee says that this time has been the most creative time in the town's history.","popularity":0.291,"poster_path":"/yrR5JmBENL2ngmH1oZFfZAjzNSS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70772,"logo_path":"/4dZxmrKg3uLLnI6oXqOKFIaXrgZ.png","name":"Art Films Production","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2005-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"modernization,moonshining,industrialization,booze,moonshine still,alcohol,moonshiner,moonshine","title":"Moonshine Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Moonshine Village","type":"Documentary"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urho Kekkonen","original_name":"Urho Kekkonen","popularity":0.3529,"profile_path":"/8IuQR3g2AGGVlIy7Vx1rsBDznLb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65741a12cadb6b080e7156ef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168318,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jarmo Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Jarmo Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741a42bbe1dd00c40bdab0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Auli Koponen","original_name":"Auli Koponen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741a57bbe1dd00fe2ae737","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Auli Koponen","original_name":"Auli Koponen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741b6fa84a4700c4218fce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hannu-Pekka Vitikainen","original_name":"Hannu-Pekka Vitikainen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741bb6c09e9900ad82a4ca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420799,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henna-Riikka Korkiakoski","original_name":"Henna-Riikka Korkiakoski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741be0cadb6b080dfe8b1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3201389,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yari","original_name":"Yari","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741bf5a84a4700fe0dd40e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2126088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heikki Innanen","original_name":"Heikki Innanen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741c06a1d33200febc53e5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3043572,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erkka Varvio","original_name":"Erkka Varvio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65741c1bbbe1dd0138cf1d9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4420872,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laura Kämppi","original_name":"Laura Kämppi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65743965e93e9500e37502a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arto Halonen","original_name":"Arto Halonen","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6574398ea1d33200c4c6641e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0940753","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":759,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/94tQkyRRwHUJraXcdPx92aZeUf8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yrR5JmBENL2ngmH1oZFfZAjzNSS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/loq9iZjXQZT4Pw8915byDhfI0Zc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160058,"name":"moonshine"},{"id":336294,"name":"illegale sterke drank"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
