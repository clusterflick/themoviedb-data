She is observed through the medium of a documentary as she goes through some sudden change... She has become a ghost.  In this comedy mockumentary, skilfully written, directed, and produced by the imaginative Ben Carr, audiences are invited to watch the strange life of Ghost (formerly Mia). Amidst the laughter, the incredible Meg Saunders takes centre stage, not only as the star but also as the mastermind behind the production design. Joe Kilky's artful cinematography brings this whimsical tale to life, capturing the essence of Mia's journey as she relearns the dance of life, is reminded of her friendships, and, perhaps, indulges in a bit of harmless ex-stalking. 'Ghost' promises an entertaining and heartfelt exploration of the unconventional aftermath of a breakup, offering a fresh and humorous perspective on the wild antics we all may have indulged in post-heartbreak.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wEkNbCc9mgF5zWcJSpLjd8YcWdH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We've
