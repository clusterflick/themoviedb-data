Secular humanism. Islam. Postmodernism. Liberal Christianity. As a Christian, how do you confront the culture with a message that is offensive without being personally offensive? Speaking \"truth in love\" is a delicate balance that makes walking on a tightrope look like a piece of cake. Prepare to go Face to Face with our 21st century, lost and utterly confused culture. Todd Friel jumps into the shark tank and takes you with him as he dares to proclaim the Gospel at the Minnesota State Fair and the University of Georgia. You will not believe what you are about to see. As the world grows increasingly dark, we are still called to be light. Let Face to Face help you be obedient to the Great Commission.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":223,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face to Face","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
