What are they arguing about? Is the way to a manâ€™s heart really through his stomach? This docu-fictional hybrid production discusses such questions with the help of authentic interview snippets that were edited under the staged plot. We get an insight into the life of an animal couple, who experience typical everyday situations on behalf of us humans. At first, our fox is emotionally contained, while the penguin lady may get wild as hell. With a wink, the filmmakers hold up a mirror to the audience in the cinema.","popularity":0.6352,"poster_path":"/3VmjuE11tCah3rUomHuGHORLDaB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apeiron
