Feeling increasingly isolated in her adopted homeland, accomplished documentarian Dai Sil Kim-Gibson travels to Cuba to unearth stories from a relatively unknown group in the Asian diaspora. On the island, she meets Martha, a woman of Korean descent who identifies herself as Cuban. Like many of her contemporary countrymen and women, Martha possesses family ties that span multiple nations, cultures and politics. Her story inspires Kim-Gibson to travel to Miami to meet Martha's émigré sister and the rest of their mulitcultural family, in a journey that reveals how very different worldviews can co-exist in one family separated by place and ideology.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tPcLNxKa63mh1geAYaHlqA8Ewal.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motherland: Cuba, Korea, USA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","original_name":"Dai Sil Kim-Gibson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/670PR0KiJXJXqM4aM2UBIwsPaLA.jpg","credit_id":"6575c2e1ec8a4300fd7d2428","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/whB6NFFdqmrQjruKJWzvUd3Rb4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8AYlkyNTDd5XhXQqbd5pBSOv84a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPcLNxKa63mh1geAYaHlqA8Ewal.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
