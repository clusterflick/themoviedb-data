The history of the town, in which a mass suicide with hundreds of deaths took place at the end of the Second World War, plays an important role. In his film, Syberberg documents his attempts, initiated decades ago, to re-establish Demmin's central market square as a place of community. A café was revived where people could watch films, drink coffee and sing together. Two architectural firms even presented concrete plans for a redesign of the square. Syberberg's commitment is not intended to restore \"old conditions\", but to give a place and a community back its lost center.","popularity":0.1602,"poster_path":"/3M0SZBeTeWVf2nUwxOjkQ7VL3SF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187565,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syberberg Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":214,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demmin Cantos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/hthqXKUzr2CADpHi1WWdakgHRmg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"662d0bfe24f2ce01262a4ed1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/hthqXKUzr2CADpHi1WWdakgHRmg.jpg","credit_id":"6572e802006b01011bdba93f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/hthqXKUzr2CADpHi1WWdakgHRmg.jpg","credit_id":"6572e80b006b0100abbda1bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Syberberg","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/hthqXKUzr2CADpHi1WWdakgHRmg.jpg","credit_id":"6572e806c4f55200c94e4c19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1403,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/3M0SZBeTeWVf2nUwxOjkQ7VL3SF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":992}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Demmin","release_date":"2023-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
