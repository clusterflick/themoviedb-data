Stepka is painting Daddy's portrait. The whole hut has already been painted with charcoal. And why does Proshka's mother love him, the foster child? After the war, there are no men in the village, the whole household is on her shoulders. And Styopka only draws, he can't even bring firewood — he'll stumble, fall.

Stepka... he is not of this world — he resurrects his father.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100714,"logo_path":"/eM5jbitlbQsiCDCJInbb0Lo3ve7.png","name":"Example of Intonation","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4422279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Olshansky","original_name":"Igor Olshansky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65753c4ba84a4700c421fda7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
