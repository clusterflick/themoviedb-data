The film centres around father of two Elias as he works with his community to try and hold onto their culture and resist the evictions. It is an intimate portrait of this community at a crossroads, facing international pressure from organisations like the World Bank, a corrupt Kenya Forest Service who are burning their houses and attempts to turn the forest into a commodity through carbon offsetting schemes.","popularity":0.203,"poster_path":"/iBh8YnfXjLq74zKInLXtZdG5hq6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149905,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grasp The Nettle
