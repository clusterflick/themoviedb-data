Sounds of car bug, car radio sound, traffic jerky voice, children’s voice, bird sounds that read every morning to inform us from the beginning of the day. But in Aleppo, people were accustomed to the sounds of war, rockets, and mortars, To the sound of the mother’s cries and the cry of the fathers, Break the glass and destroy the houses. Now the war is over and everything is drowned in silence and wind. Silence is as eternal as is full of fear and loneliness. Full of stories buried under the rubble.
