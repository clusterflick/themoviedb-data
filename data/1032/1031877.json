The Adagietto is a revelation, a spiritual oasis. It is not an expression of pain, but rather Mahler's declaration of love to Alma a song without words.\" With the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Chailly gives the piece an unsurpassed intensity of sound and emotional expression. He achieves a compelling arc of tension in which the symphony's unique fascination unfolds. The Wiener Zeitung characterized Chailly's interpretation as \"impressive with powerful and unreserved intensity.\"","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/vLOilRyYrq3A8xOTePbSD7bsxRu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gustav Mahler - Symphony No. 5 (Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig, Riccardo Chailly)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Chailly","original_name":"Riccardo Chailly","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/lIA0VTcCG1wgGAKwVbPi3t9TYOc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"633cb39a006b01007f27bb71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gewandhausorchester Leipzig","original_name":"Gewandhausorchester Leipzig","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Orquesta","credit_id":"633cb3ae68929c008177f71f","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mU1RSYVFWq3YCWnHORyGuJpR3OE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1620}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1309,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vLOilRyYrq3A8xOTePbSD7bsxRu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":873},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrj89SvHo3QFDvTK6gBrVYrFsqp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
