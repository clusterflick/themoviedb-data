He was taken up in the mental clinic of the Leipzig University soon afterwards. To his rehabilition he wrote an extensive piece of work, \"Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken\" (Memoirs of My Nervous Illness), which was published in 1903 and led to his temporary dismissal. Hereby Schreber became the most quoted psychiatric patient in scientific literature.","popularity":0.0804,"poster_path":"/mXDmsiwpG4sEgczeC9MD81YPX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c83c65ab81a0079bf099a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Praglowski","original_name":"Susanne Praglowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c8384006b01007abaeba1","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2964398,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Paul Schreber","original_name":"Daniel Paul Schreber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c83b04df2910091386657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c836e5ab81a0081c27ede","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","original_name":"Ernst Schmidt Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c837620e6a5007c38c4af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Tscherkassky","original_name":"Peter Tscherkassky","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/gH3qDFx9g286QbfUS6BLWD3BZ1y.jpg","credit_id":"633c838c20e6a500817a1466","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":876,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/mXDmsiwpG4sEgczeC9MD81YPX8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":584}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
