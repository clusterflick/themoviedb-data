Beginning in the mid 70s, the documentary will cover the rise in popularity and the fall in success in the mid to late 2000s. The entire documentary will cover the independent video stores, gas stations, tanning salons, etc that provided rental services (both videos and video games). The story will be told via variety of interviews and narration from the people that actually lived the story. Independent Video Store Owners, Filmmakers, Employees, Distributors, and more. The documentary hopes to tell a story of how these experiences shaped lives and built memories. Also we will look into the logistics of how local businesses dealt with rising distribution costs and ask the question of \"Why did so many tanning salons also rent videos?\"","popularity":0.3007,"poster_path":"/5FWaL1IL5QCP5YMm5I66HBDsbwQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mom n' Pop: The Indie Video Store Boom of the 80s/90s","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Kaufman","original_name":"Lloyd Kaufman","popularity":0.5372,"profile_path":"/4jNIqeZBK2YbpPupBhl4l1moQn5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65130feee1faed0100eac39a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2671468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James D.
