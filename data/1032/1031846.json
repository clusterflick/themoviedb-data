Stein), one has to repress a lot, for example the sacrifice of Iphigenia or Elektra's feminist rebellion. The Oresteia represents an \"Egyptian\" material, situated between Europe and Asia, incomprehensible to both. That makes it interesting for a possible, currently necessary rapprochement between the two parts of the world. One would need, Müller says, to undertake a completely new translation, because in the existing ones the irrational elements have already been smoothed over.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Owe the World a Dead Person","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heiner Müller","original_name":"Heiner Müller","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/8fkxltvF5a65F9EO0tw8FKwc3a0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"633ca4eb5ab81a0079bf11f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"633ca4f987f3f2007f2fa25b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
