When grown, she has become the leading lady in a San Francisco stock-company. She meets and falls in love with Ted, the millionaire son of a rich widow, but she thinks he is only a tax-cab driver. His mother objects to the romance and looks into Doris' past. She learns that her father had murdered, in a fit of jealousy, her mother, and tells Doris what she has found out. The four actors who had raised her had never told her how she happened to become an orphan. They persuade Ted's mother to send him on a voyage to the Orient in order to get him away from Doris. But they neglected to tell the mother they had also booked passage for Doris on the same ship.","popularity":0.4405,"poster_path":"/amwbKei85pDdqj1X1LLgRG0NGZc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everybody's Acting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Bronson","original_name":"Betty Bronson","popularity":0.1112,"profile_path":"/j7uTju9dDw8jBdsGOz33l73wnqq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Doris Poole","credit_id":"633bd617c2ff3d007ad6452e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ford Sterling","original_name":"Ford Sterling","popularity":0.2488,"profile_path":"/jWwCuNR2eRpgxlRBKNTCTmCVHP0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michael Poole","credit_id":"633bd627cfe48f007bfa3b61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Dresser","original_name":"Louise Dresser","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":"/i7NYAqqzY6uhI0IEcwPeYP9tNKt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anastasia Potter","credit_id":"633bd636cfe48f0092db7791","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Gray","original_name":"Lawrence Gray","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/bDBFtxbeS9FY5SQk3weSEuOmrAk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ted Potter","credit_id":"633bd64142f19f00845a787c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
