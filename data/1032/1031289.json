He behaves like Croesus when dealing with the staff. With his snobby and abusive conduct, Meier even manages to expel other guests from the restaurant. Meier sharply criticizes his ordered food after just a single bite and demands a completely new meal \"on the house.\" The restaurant's chefs Harald and Tim feel their professional honor is grossly insulted. Together with waiter Peter, they discuss how to put this \"problematic guest\" in his place, working themselves meanwhile into a rage. Will diplomacy triumph over barbarous brutality or is violence sometimes indeed a solution? And what does an instant photo camera have to do with all this?","popularity":0.1308,"poster_path":"/wVe6c67ll8qRVUCbuQz5Z8jV6iP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felix Wollner Medienproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delicatessen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Biermeier","original_name":"Werner Biermeier","popularity":0.1401,"profile_path":"/tnGBzMOQcOuqKiMX7ukTMdX3Lg7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harald","credit_id":"633acc8887f3f20082875b45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Liljeström","original_name":"Jonas Liljeström","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/4cvWoJSr6QmrM6QIJlRtlJ5GFIs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"633acc944cbe120079a2bc3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3269810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Robert","original_name":"Ivan Robert","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Meier","credit_id":"633acd24c2ff3d00823f0577","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1816657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arne Rudolf","original_name":"Arne Rudolf","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rainer","credit_id":"633acedf38469a007fb500a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3725241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kruna Savić","original_name":"Kruna Savic","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nicole","credit_id":"633acd5c87f3f2007a30075a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Wichert","original_name":"Ryan Wichert","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/a0MfFNm9vv7VI8pjDea5i7Po17S.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"633acd99481382007aa01caf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3725236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Wollner","original_name":"Felix Wollner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633acc4c2b113d007ae83741","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4750673,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Stulgies","original_name":"Daniel Stulgies","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665c982d5491ed096481c2b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4750672,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dominik Hilbert","original_name":"Dominik Hilbert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665c981ffda4f1621b59639d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3725236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Wollner","original_name":"Felix Wollner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665c9823ad19ed0112a0a86d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5166200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wVe6c67ll8qRVUCbuQz5Z8jV6iP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
