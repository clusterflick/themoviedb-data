For him, Erich Honecker is an example for \"forced stoicism\". Müller agrees with the following quote by Goethe: May God save me from self-awareness! For Müller, it represents a stoic attitude. When asked about \"patriotism\" in the sense of \"What would you risk your life for, if necessary?\", he can only come up with something \"silly\" at first: his daughter. But Müller is also a patriot of theater, in the sense of \"maeeuticism\", of putting-effort-into-it.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigor Was His Mark of Quality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heiner Müller","original_name":"Heiner Müller","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/8fkxltvF5a65F9EO0tw8FKwc3a0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"633ca8afcf48a1007dbca5de","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"633ca8b94cbe12009070463b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
