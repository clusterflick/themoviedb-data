It features eleven newly recorded tracks, along with a remix of their 1986 single \"Venus\" (done by Soft Cell's Marc Almond) and a 2005 remix of their 1982 single \"Really Saying Something\", an underground bootleg club hit produced by Solasso.  Drama is a comeback of sorts for Bananarama members Keren Woodward and Sara Dallin and is their first album to be released in their native UK since 1993. The album's first single \"Move in My Direction\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 14, also becoming their first UK top-40 entry since 1993. The second single, \"Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)\", also reached the UK top 40, and climbed to number two on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart as an import, becoming Bananarama's biggest US dancefloor hit since \"Venus\" two decades earlier.","popularity":0.3245,"poster_path":"/fcrUYtHqYg51Jrrr5rT6rVmwDcN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bananarama Drama","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2025359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keren Woodward","original_name":"Keren Woodward","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/vKMQ6qA6HWS62rlfa98ON2KGnFh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633a787b42d8370082ed0386","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2305193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Dallin","original_name":"Sara Dallin","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/mKaRy2i73j2UR6eHFc4chbQPaig.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633a78af42f19f008195cf1f","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fcrUYtHqYg51Jrrr5rT6rVmwDcN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
