Aguilera brought the nostalgia as she was joined by Mya for a rendition of Moulin Rouge!‘s “Lady Marmalade.” She also brought out pop star Kim Petras for a performance of her song “XXX” and Paris Hilton to perform her hit “Stars Are Blind”.  The performance featured a closet’s worth of stunning Pride flag-colored outfits that she switched in and out of as she belted out her classic hits like the 2003 orchestral-tinged arena rock song “Fighter.” Xtina also shouted out her LGBTQ+ fans with a montage that ferociously came after Florida’s state legislature for its atrocious “Don’t Say Gay” bill. It was iconic, to say the least.","popularity":0.3765,"poster_path":"/qmYqeUSFTor8wGu82hemaCXegDu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Christina Aguilera - LA Pride","title":"Christina Aguilera - LA Pride","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Aguilera","original_name":"Christina Aguilera","popularity":0.8615,"profile_path":"/eGe03QC8AgLau5DSZkmlGzSP8yN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633c52fb42f19f0081968989","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8nZbzrhT1Dp7gmsF6dLGQ0YsYj3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pgmvF7P3IJZyflPRl78Jj08kbOC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qmYqeUSFTor8wGu82hemaCXegDu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":206353,"name":"live show"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
