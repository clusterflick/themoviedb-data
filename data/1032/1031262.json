The Housing Authority regarded them as private property and denied owners the opportunity to apply for public housing. Now the government has ordered these 40,000 dwellings to be removed, without offering fair resettlement terms for the residents who had moved in after 1982. Video Power recorded the negotiations before some of these houses were torn down in Mongkok.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tragedy Ahead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheng Chi-hung","original_name":"Cheng Chi-hung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633aab97175051008e176061","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
