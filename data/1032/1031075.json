This movie is called: Across the Universe. In this film, each street and square was filmed in a single sequence shot and each of the plaques for these streets and squares is placed at the beginning of each street and square.  In order to offer a maximum of views of the city, here is Les Chutes de Saint-Marcellin, an appendix to Across the Universe which is made up of shots that were not retained for this film but which deserve to be kept and shown.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":"/zdmYVZi5EP21q4sbdZAKFAsLhZs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Chutes de Saint-Marcellin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"6339c7e22cefc20082cf5185","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"6339c7dab0ba7e0079139870","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"6339c7ebcf48a1007dbba145","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"6339c7f54cbe1200906f5f1e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12462716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zdmYVZi5EP21q4sbdZAKFAsLhZs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"YouTube site","release_date":"2014-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
