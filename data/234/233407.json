It is not a play about chess, in any explicit sense, but it does feature a lovable if curmudgeonly old man in a dustbin. Generally accepted to be Beckett's bleakest play - indeed after it's 1957 English debut at the Royal Court, the TLS's Olivier Todd quipped that it made Waiting for Godot look like \"a cheerful operetta\". However, Beckett himself described it as \"the favourite of my plays.\" Although the programme was not broadcast until 1991 it was recorded in 1989 prior to Beckett's death and had his blessing. This production is particularly notable as it is first full-length television performance of the play.","popularity":0.5215,"poster_path":"/thMNnM22Uk1BVg0MHsL42sd3LJN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endgame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Beaton","original_name":"Norman Beaton","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/hhRi0WiHXqzEPujzuLPyrxnNQV8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hamm","credit_id":"59a5c2e19251412f580112dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Rea","original_name":"Stephen Rea","popularity":0.9,"profile_path":"/17ZSGqvJqdvInuw1TlQlkf39yfi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clov","credit_id":"52fe4e1bc3a36847f827e429","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Drake","original_name":"Charlie Drake","popularity":0.228,"profile_path":"/aXG8L5HWucZnzXFdOXL2YDmnf2A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nagg","credit_id":"52fe4e1bc3a36847f827e42d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Binchy","original_name":"Kate Binchy","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nell","credit_id":"52fe4e1bc3a36847f827e431","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Coe","original_name":"Tony Coe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1bc3a36847f827e421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Samuel Beckett","original_name":"Samuel Beckett","popularity":0.4117,"profile_path":"/e1SlVssYS2O6Xq35u89ZKHPKEgt.jpg","credit_id":"66e1626e85c0a02840051882","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0365162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":2617,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/thMNnM22Uk1BVg0MHsL42sd3LJN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1880}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
