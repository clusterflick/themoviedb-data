When the Emperor Nero decides to renew persecution of the Christians, Marcus opposes him, fearing for the safety of Mercia, the Christian woman whom he loves. Through the machinations of the Empress Poppaea and other women at court, Tigellinus, Nero's agent in the war against the Christians, convinces Nero to have Mercia arrested. Marcus appeals to the emperor for mercy, but is told that she can be saved only by renouncing Christianity. Waiting to enter the arena to be killed, Mercia steadfastly refuses to reject her religion, despite Marcus' pleas. Finally, Marcus is converted by her and they enter the arena to face death together.","popularity":0.1686,"poster_path":"/hL4ZW604u9FmiAaviETu8nbH9Ju.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25599,"logo_path":"/sPZZwYvN3xEGo7q8E9iYKrggjDz.png","name":"Famous Players Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sign of the Cross","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Farnum","original_name":"William Farnum","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/a2N7jJoXYLHaUFBDMGMuIgqja60.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marcus Superbus","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268794,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rosina Henley","original_name":"Rosina Henley","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mercia, a Christian maid","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheridan Block","original_name":"Sheridan Block","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nero","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbcf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Thorpe","original_name":"Morgan Thorpe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Favius","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbd3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Grey Terry","original_name":"Ethel Grey Terry","popularity":0.1909,"profile_path":"/fYMETqh7IpasIWZD182kIf3juvA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Berenice","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbd7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Barclay","original_name":"Lila Barclay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Poppaea","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbdb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Majeroni","original_name":"George Majeroni","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":"/hzi9XBlwH3Zgz4QoPr26rmjnFrD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tigellinus","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbdf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ogden Childe","original_name":"Ogden Childe","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Stephanus","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbe3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Phillips","original_name":"Ethel Phillips","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bGo35tF9KS2JUQKELrA62FynH0m.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dacia","credit_id":"52fe4e18c3a36847f827dbe7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles E.
