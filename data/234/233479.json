The two meet again in 1893 after 30-years.  Vance Dillinger is now a U.S. Marshal, while Tom “Lucky” Dillinger is a wanted bandit with a bounty on his head.  A robbery gone wrong allows the identity of Lucky to be exposed, sending Vance and his posse on the trail to capture Lucky and his gang.  A chance discovery unveils information that the killer of the Dillinger parents is still alive, leading Lucky on a ruthless quest for revenge, as Vance struggles between feelings of retribution and upholding the honor of legal justice.","popularity":0.8356,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Bath an' a Stiff Drink","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Patterson","original_name":"Jeffrey Patterson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vance Dillinger","credit_id":"52fe4e1cc3a36847f827e74d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy V.
