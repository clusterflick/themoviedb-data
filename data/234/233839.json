The storylines of the boy who loves Famicom and the middle-aged man who loves Famicom eventually merge into one.","popularity":0.5201,"poster_path":"/cWMfNu436NEmewyktaT96a4bCUO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3341,"logo_path":"/dTG5dXE1kU2mpmL9BNnraffckLU.png","name":"Fuji Television Network","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":18060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gascoin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To everyone who loved Famicom","title":"GameCenter CX: The Movie - 1986 Mighty Bomb Jack","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Retro Game Master: The Movie","type":"Loccalized Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinya Arino","original_name":"有野晋哉","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/zUlvghWB60hmJcICszh1GT8ng7l.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chief Arino","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a36847f828049f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hajime Yoshi","original_name":"Hajime Yoshi","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Daisuke","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a36847f82804a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuna Taira","original_name":"平祐奈","popularity":0.7111,"profile_path":"/98rGALQXTfFwvtNxIaQH3iQ1Rln.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kumiko","credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a36847f82804a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takamasa Abe","original_name":"Takamasa Abe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Makoto","credit_id":"658aaac9b7b69d08626e8100","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4449154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaito Matsushima","original_name":"Kaito Matsushima","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Keita","credit_id":"658aaafc0721666729a6f85a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3561114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kakeru Yoshida","original_name":"Kakeru Yoshida","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kato","credit_id":"658aab12dd2589715b6c2699","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1998992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asami Kokoro","original_name":"朝見心","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/dfoMFsoWYB7vv7qG7IK8Eiqx70H.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sumire Tanaka","credit_id":"658aab3f4da3d465ee413b75","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masatoshi Kurakata","original_name":"蔵方政俊","popularity":0.1669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e24c3a36847f82804ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921404,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kensaku Sakai","original_name":"酒井健作","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658aab82dd258971ae6c0df5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3075398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zbsFS7sJfsugBQHdyU1AgPzUZmG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/cWMfNu436NEmewyktaT96a4bCUO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282,"name":"video game"},{"id":269769,"name":"based on tv series"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"『ゲームセンターCX THE MOVIE 1986 マイティボンジャック』特報","key":"eE-5W5dBlW8","published_at":"2013-11-07T03:00:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec721c3a368544800b6e8"}]}}}
