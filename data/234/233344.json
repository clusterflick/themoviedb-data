As a bellhop in a hotel, Hughey managed to get possession of a wonderful ruby, the eye of Ammet, and with its aid obtained an introduction to a millionaire and his beautiful daughter. But Hughey failed to remember that for every ruby or other gem stolen from an Egyptian shrine, there is a bearded sheik who has taken a vow never to eat, drink or sleep until the talisman has been returned to the irate God from whom it was stolen, and vengeance has been wrought on the guilty one. Just when Hughey is enjoying himself immensely at a fine little dinner with the fair damsel, his nemesis, the sheik, discovers him and a lively chase takes place. The sheik gets the ruby in his possession but Hughey regains it in jig time and the prospects are that the poor sheik will have some wait before he can look a square meal in the face again.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/vzelIjFGnztJZgWTH5xCG8ezBdc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man from Egypt","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hughie Mack","original_name":"Hughie Mack","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/qSIspcIVazqgoYY38cjaguQRvDK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hughey","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a36847f827dd4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jewell Hunt","original_name":"Jewell Hunt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jewell Mazuma","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a36847f827dd53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Flatow","original_name":"John Flatow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Man From Egypt","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a36847f827dd57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hammill","original_name":"Harry Hammill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"High Priest","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a36847f827dd5b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Price","original_name":"Kate Price","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/auh0gxFdHdeT08W9zEv9VQMYa95.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Mazuma","credit_id":"52fe4e19c3a36847f827dd63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Shea","original_name":"William Shea","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/Ag5IBOVM6UhMnSjsSMoZWLGb80V.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Mazuma","credit_id":"584f0e799251410700002129","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115868,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"C.
