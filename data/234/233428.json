That’s why she can hardly believe her own good fortune, as it turns out that her cousin Rudolf is an old friend of Romay and wants to introduce them. Romay and Melitta hit it off straight away, and before poor Rudolf can look twice, the woman he’s in love with is married off to someone else. Over the years, the marriage crumbles, and a tragic accident hits Melitta so hard that she has to leave for warmer climes. Romay continues his career and the wild social life that comes with it, but his past suddenly catches up with him.
