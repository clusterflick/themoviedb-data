A world where a small cabal of handsome killers, Zombies, seduce and pray upon innocent men at will. \"Zombies\" follows Christian on a downward spiral as his memory awakens from the numb life he's grown accustomed to. His past causes the line between madness and sanity to blur. Taunted by the young men he brutally killed, misunderstood by his best friend, Jason, and victimized by his chief rival, Cain, Christian seeks refuge in the supporting embrace of Matthew. Christian is forced to choose between a life of absolute power or abandon his dark existence and walk the Earth as a mortal.","popularity":0.1969,"poster_path":"/yke3ZXD085xVlyyjkoYdlMqrD1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dead Guys Cinema","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The man you love is the monster you fear...","title":"Zombies","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Creed Bowlen","original_name":"Creed Bowlen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cain","credit_id":"52fe4e14c3a36847f827cc77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":63337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Dean","original_name":"Eric Dean","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/3Mei5gWnzPaNC4f71MZGIDd8rbh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jason (as Eric Turic)","credit_id":"52fe4e14c3a36847f827cc7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1055249,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Draven Gonzalez","original_name":"Draven Gonzalez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Matthew","credit_id":"52fe4e14c3a36847f827cc7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Hoffman","original_name":"Jason Hoffman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Samuel","credit_id":"52fe4e14c3a36847f827cc83","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Jaeger","original_name":"Mark Jaeger","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"52fe4e14c3a36847f827cc87","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Williams","original_name":"Jonathan Williams","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Christian","credit_id":"52fe4e14c3a36847f827cc8b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Pucci","original_name":"Alex Pucci","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605e810653866e006a8ae43a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0447723","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1377,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yke3ZXD085xVlyyjkoYdlMqrD1f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":918}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":12377,"name":"zombie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
