He had offered to mediate an end to the the war. Russia agreed because of the shocking losses they had suffered at Mukden and Tsushima, and the naval revolt in Odessa. Japan had agreed because they feared a drawn-out war would cripple them financially. Besides, the treaty's terms gave them control of Korea. This film documents the world leaders presence in Portsmouth with military parades and naval ships.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1905-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace Envoys at Portsmouth, N.H.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3335472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1905-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Peace Envoys at Portsmouth, N.H.
