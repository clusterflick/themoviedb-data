Brady, Dorothy's brother, has had an affair with a simple mountain maid. She, unable to care for the child, lays it with a note, at what she thinks is Brady's door. In reality, she has taken it to Mayfield's cabin. He finds it, but out of love for Sue, and to spare her the reflected disgrace, he cares for it himself, keeping silent as to its parentage. The love between himself and Sue ripens. Sue is ready to forget the feud and marry him. In order to prevent this, Brady, not knowing whence the child came, accuses Mayfield of being its parent. The accused is silent and Sue turns away. Mayfield, in the meantime, is unable to stand the fruits of injustice and the taunts of Brady. He tells Brady the true parentage of the child. Brady is softened. He tells Mayfield he is going to find its mother and \"Make it right.\"","popularity":0.2857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breed o' the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe Mayfield","credit_id":"620fe25b1f0275001b835358","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sue Jarvis","credit_id":"620fe26a4f9a99006c21ba90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Brady","original_name":"Ed Brady","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/vVep5r5nxvuex9RrYXJ8THR5uuM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Brady Jarvis","credit_id":"620fe2781f0275006a669ba0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3426924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucile Wilson","original_name":"Lucile Wilson","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Mountain Maid","credit_id":"620fe285f90b19006d37d0ba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","credit_id":"620fe1d3aa7898006919e562","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry G.
