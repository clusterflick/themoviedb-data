A series of invitations were sent out by Ifekoya to their extended black, queer and trans community for a dancer, a drummer, a gathering around breath and breathing and a sonic response to these images. This new video work explores the relationship between documentation and liveness, opening portals of intimacy by bringing people together through different spaces and time. It is part of a series of works exploring the reparative dimension of sound and its potential as a gateway to alternate aspects of our reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Undercurrent 528","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1701608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Ifekoya","original_name":"Evan Ifekoya","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jBQXpFehXcfUIaj3frJwiLSM6Be.jpg","credit_id":"620f982ef48e0d006712b762","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
