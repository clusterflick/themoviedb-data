Someone wants to join in and play but isn't allowed. Someone is crying and someone is teasing. Someone is finally called a friend. Wanted to be Friends is a film that is completely on the children's side. With a camera that is consistently on level with the children, it immediately feels like being six years old again - with all the big emotional fluctuations that entails.","popularity":0.0569,"poster_path":"/oAk1uo9nSWtmWLPY5BvicF0xQNJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14803,"logo_path":"/uPtAlOlAL3RHWg4xc5nMPfkKjWS.png","name":"Story AB","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Scenes from a youth centre","title":"Wanted to be Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marika Heidebäck","original_name":"Marika Heidebäck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210d8ece72fe8001b29b3fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marika Heidebäck","original_name":"Marika Heidebäck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210d8f5a84ff700475717b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668796,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Örnborn","original_name":"Jenny Örnborn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210d90796670e001bdf0fe3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anders Bennysson","original_name":"Anders Bennysson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210d91896670e00417b32de","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marika Heidebäck","original_name":"Marika Heidebäck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210d92de267de001c5ee546","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":555772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominika Daubenbüchel","original_name":"Dominika Daubenbüchel","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210d93caa78980042fa3bf6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7321816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1392,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pBi9LSlqVsjgZZCmSB1tt9ZeWO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2475}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":948,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oAk1uo9nSWtmWLPY5BvicF0xQNJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":948,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/wdIVzXHKTIwVpd6tJ8BMGoqXAuR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"Btl","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gothenburg Film Festival","release_date":"2009-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
