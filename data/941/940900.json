Our heroes, the four Voice Rangers, rise up to the occasion in this near-future science fiction action romp that is sure to be a favorite among boys. The four heroes, the Voice Rangers, rise to the occasion. The four men shoot guns, chase and confront Kolo (the dog) in the high school and the surrounding residential area. Their exploits are portrayed in a dynamic and ridiculous way, with parodies of TV shows, clones of famous scenes from American films and MTV flicks. This is a film that is 10 years ahead of its time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/97b9Ip3lReVOBNRkpBx98kLgOwK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"COROMADA II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takatsuka Koichi","original_name":"Takatsuka Koichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62114f7cd100b60042fc921b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamaga Kourou","original_name":"Kamaga Kourou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62114f83e72fe80043b5ba22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hosaka Seiichi","original_name":"Hosaka Seiichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62114f8d9f1be70044882988","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564867,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Takashi Suzuki","original_name":"Takashi Suzuki","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"62114f9296670e00417ca017","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oba Koji","original_name":"Oba Koji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"62114f9889b5610042274a53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taishi Kitamura","original_name":"Taishi Kitamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"62114f9fa84ff70020d5b8d5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mr.J","original_name":"Mr.J","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f12a84ff7006d2318dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564867,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Takashi Suzuki","original_name":"Takashi Suzuki","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f1e03f0b6001b65950e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taishi Kitamura","original_name":"Taishi Kitamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f26f6fd18001c350126","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Ohba","original_name":"Hiroshi Ohba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f2fe72fe8001b2b1f86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Ohba","original_name":"Hiroshi Ohba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f5003f0b6001b6595be","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Ohba","original_name":"Hiroshi Ohba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f54d100b60042fc91b4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taishi Kitamura","original_name":"Taishi Kitamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f5b96670e001be07feb","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taishi Kitamura","original_name":"Taishi Kitamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f6044a4240046c8013f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564867,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Takashi Suzuki","original_name":"Takashi Suzuki","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f6820e6a50042ba9aab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564867,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Takashi Suzuki","original_name":"Takashi Suzuki","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114f6d9f1be70020256ad0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/97b9Ip3lReVOBNRkpBx98kLgOwK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
