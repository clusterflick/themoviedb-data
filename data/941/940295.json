Shot on location in Glasgow in late 2021, this is the first in a two-part series of films exploring masculinity and stages of (identifying) male physical and psychological development in Britain. This work is in response to the expansive oeuvre of Stephen Dwoskin, in particular his early portrait films, but also follows a strand of research and enquiry which has been active in Salmon's own feminist film practice. That is, gendered dynamics experienced within the everyday, expressed through the body and film culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy (winter)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620f949c396e970042c1649d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
