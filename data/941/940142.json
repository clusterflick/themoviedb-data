Lawsuits were started, but the corporation managed to gain the best of the argument, when Ruth took the law into her own hands, held up the coach, and stored the big strong box in the bushes.

The company's agent lost his nerve, and as appreciation, deeded back the old homestead to Ruth.","popularity":0.1421,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Even Exchange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"620ef56c1f0275006a645b92","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2334575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Rich","original_name":"Vivian Rich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8N0e2etPMt1wist0a8iOCdGwE20.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"620ef57aca0e17001b3f4c17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Field","original_name":"George Field","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/xttgd3AAhejnHpvCIASVUceDIGv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"620ef584a242320044bcf6c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chester Withey","original_name":"Chester Withey","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"620ef58ec7a7e0001b8e9e05","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1385888","wikidata_id":"Q20004781","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
