Arrangements of marks and geometric forms are faced with unresolved states. Objects struggle to maintain their shape, stay upright, or avoid disappearing. \"Crux Film\" is an animation composed of segments of work by Lilli Carré and Alexander Stewart. Created over the course of several weeks in shared studio spaces, these simple animated segments developed directly in response to one another; ideas, images, challenges and structures ping-ponging back and forth between the two animator’s light boxes.","popularity":0.0472,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crux Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Stewart","original_name":"Alexander Stewart","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/yAPbUQ8YWIl6ifZSin2HzmHlGBQ.jpg","credit_id":"620f356cc7a7e0001b8fa401","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2139576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lilli Carré","original_name":"Lilli Carré","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273afc106f9840066bb4d8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
