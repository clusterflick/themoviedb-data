Everything is harmonious, when like a flash of lightning from a clear sky, a quarrel, through some trifling difference of opinion, arises between the two wives, which leads to the severance of the happy relations of the two families, excepting the two children, who fortunately cannot grasp the meaning of it all and consequently remain in blissful ignorance of its purpose and are happy only when in each other's company.","popularity":0.1408,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barriers Burned Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Martin - First Brother","credit_id":"621163ef44a424006c6564f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gardner","original_name":"Helen Gardner","popularity":0.171,"profile_path":"/bHrfs217SpcLvVR2SQl0IM7dbgE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John's Wife","credit_id":"6211640ae92d8300428ab49f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","original_name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","popularity":0.1407,"profile_path":"/9xKPzh1DDCLFFh78c7l9SsOGe5r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Edwin's Wife","credit_id":"6211641796670e00417ce441","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele DeGarde","original_name":"Adele DeGarde","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/frdVYPfQMeCaygDxTwSnetDCPsg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tillie - Edwin's Daughter","credit_id":"62116425e92d83001b445595","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Casey","original_name":"Kenneth Casey","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/80nGT9KLVWl0w0Cyh6tg9Tz4JCf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Frank - John's Son","credit_id":"6211643c44a4240046c846e7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gaillard","original_name":"Robert Gaillard","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/m5QWpQiBXRETL3ujyamQdykNkhh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edwin Martin - Second Brother","credit_id":"621163fdaa78980042fc125a","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0340002","wikidata_id":"Q3635193","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
