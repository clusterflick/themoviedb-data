Is the grass really always greener on the other side? And what is home, after all - is it four walls and a roof above your head, or a view from your window, a bench in the park, the smell of the city in the spring? Is it a place of strength which gives you a feeling of security and comfort, or is it a space that allows you to realise your creative ambition, or is it a person who accepts you as you are? Together with the protagonists, we move there and back again, between home and not-home, between the past and the present, between Ukraine and not-Ukraine, immersing ourselves in their worldviews and testing our own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yuA0H6wVU5x4Edy6P9HAX24GrIi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2017-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meanwhile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Між іншим","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Appen","original_name":"Yuliya Appen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210056eaa7898001b5e098e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2446494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykyta Lyskov","original_name":"Mykyta Lyskov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/efL9uNY9AZkDP9Ny1tK3Lc7AtGb.jpg","credit_id":"6210058141465c0044b445cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalka Tselyuba","original_name":"Natalka Tselyuba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100593d100b6001bdc1d5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandra Vasyna","original_name":"Oleksandra Vasyna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621005a2e72fe80068bf5395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Appen","original_name":"Yuliya Appen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621005b1e0ca7f001b6c6b45","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2446494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykyta Lyskov","original_name":"Mykyta Lyskov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/efL9uNY9AZkDP9Ny1tK3Lc7AtGb.jpg","credit_id":"621005c10e4fc80044027426","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalka Tselyuba","original_name":"Natalka Tselyuba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621005d2151c5c001c3fa16c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandra Vasyna","original_name":"Oleksandra Vasyna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621005e39824c8006a8be088","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalka Tselyuba","original_name":"Natalka Tselyuba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621005f59824c8001be18b8c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Appen","original_name":"Yuliya Appen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6210060541465c006c5b5052","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Appen","original_name":"Yuliya Appen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100613be2d49006cd3c008","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18277750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"mizhmizhmizh","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yuA0H6wVU5x4Edy6P9HAX24GrIi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bardak Film Fest","release_date":"2017-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
