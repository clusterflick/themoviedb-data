Their ambitious teacher, Ilkay, is determined to create an inclusive, supportive and safe environment for the kids. The majority of children don’t speak German at home, some families are wounded by war experience and many face discrimination. Despite few resources from the educational system, Ilkay gently navigates her class through daily adventures, defeats and victories. The result is an astonishingly cheerful portrait of a small community mirroring the complexities of contemporary European society. The film is an ode to childhood, celebrating the work of educators and lifelong learning in and outside the classroom.","popularity":0.4208,"poster_path":"/z4Lv2TdaGn4UKhzMGzoW2bFj7f8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11389,"logo_path":"/eKVLElq1XAbcCcwnVj89G9EXRGB.png","name":"OFI","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":10273,"logo_path":"/a3XYUgEqAAuPsNL4xvBZSXGJCt0.png","name":"Filmfonds
