In the Lviv region, in the very heart of Bandera's territory, there is the town of Chervonohrad, famous for being the first Soviet place where a statue of Lenin was torn down. However, even 26 years later, there is a heated debate between the proponents of different ideologies. We see the opposite poles of Ukrainian society in front of us: a choir of the Russian community named The Living Memory, and a singing couple of OUN-URA nationalists called the Undefeated. What they have in common is the Chervonohrad People's House. The story is about the deep, implicit processes which actually stand behind the torn-down monuments, and about the way two parallel universes collide in the Chervonohrad People's House.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pCRZuxLJ8ATykQCbCGgKFAqjTDb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alive
