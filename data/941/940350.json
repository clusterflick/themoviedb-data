Believing the Lord allowed him to take whatever he wanted as the church is, after all, the house of the Lord, the young thief steals away, enjoying his strange sense of entitlement. The Priest, however, sees the thief for exactly what he is â€“ a thief. And so he chases him away, telling him not to come back. The young thief, upset by this, begins a series of pranks against the Priest, confusing the holy man along the way. Eventually figuring out what is really going on, the Priest turns the tables on the young prankster and finally manages to get rid of the boy once and for all.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/vVm0uflF5n7MLzwHb6UdF8xldTG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1980-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Priest and The Thief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khulikani Magubane","original_name":"Khulikani Magubane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"620fb474e0ca7f006ac9cc83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sizwe Dlamini","original_name":"Sizwe Dlamini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"620fb484d100b6001bdb2314","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gugu Mhlanga","original_name":"Gugu Mhlanga","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"620fb4904c2592001bbf6e5e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wanna Fourie","original_name":"Wanna Fourie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620fb41ee0ca7f006ac9cbe5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary-Ann Spangenberg","original_name":"Mary-Ann Spangenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620fb4504c2592001bbf6dd3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wanna Fourie","original_name":"Wanna Fourie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620fb42d3f4833001c8e0201","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vVm0uflF5n7MLzwHb6UdF8xldTG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
