His 1996 album Straight Up, with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade, and 2004’s Take It from the Top, with bassist James Genus and drummer Billy Kilson, are career highlights and gems of their genre. Those records will never escape the shadow of 1978’s Touchdown or 1975’s One, but now James gives us the best of both worlds, revisiting his biggest hits in a trio format and tossing in other tunes.  Despite its title, Feel Like Making LIVE! isn’t a concert recording. It was recorded “live in the studio” with old pal Kilson and young bassist Michael Palazzolo, who’s been in James’ bands for several years now. Rather than swing like a bop trio, they play classy, R&B- and pop-tinged jazz that’s both accessible and adventurous.","popularity":0.2697,"poster_path":"/nWnXT86oAqdMS7RPwAn3cv4Pvbn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bob James Trio - Feel Like Making LIVE!","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob James","original_name":"Bob James","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/3x92WEKIw3ygmMfwPbhoqtGnWqW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"620ea944396e97001bb48512","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Palazzolo","original_name":"Michael Palazzolo","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":"/3jpIQevK74yBXF1v2HUFJQpbgcC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"620ea96d7ad08c006cc06e9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Kilson","original_name":"Billy Kilson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vF0e7rIDQgRPVQ7VT3drgRfNTjt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"620ea98bf90b190044e4960d","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/riUfm889VbuMWsQAHony5YUUj7p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1nJzpekNEaw0Vj1bOD3fTjzbQJ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/XbLiIyCJFj6SEuUEnPaEBThlq7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3iI40t4p8vU0N1w72tJqefDavmV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nWnXT86oAqdMS7RPwAn3cv4Pvbn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dXjrOMkSikgR81SyOO8N7UmyGYO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":196055,"name":"jazz fusion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
