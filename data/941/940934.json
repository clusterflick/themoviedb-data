She sets off on a trip to the Sea of Japan to find the truth, but her souvenirs are rather dull, including a rather rude female friend. This time she takes her younger brother Harumi with her to her home town. Together with Sawada, a classmate of Harumi's and a close friend of Miwa's, the three of them spend a summer holiday that takes them back to their childhood. However, when Miwa takes a picture of the place where her house used to be, when she plays pranks at the swimming pool, or when she catches a cold and falls asleep, she thinks about her father who suddenly disappeared one day.","popularity":0.3256,"poster_path":"/10MEHvCphgirF2Dkcu2dRCtDGUk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I DON'T TALK MUCH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamae Ando","original_name":"安藤玉恵","popularity":0.5485,"profile_path":"/q5orVhvKOFZbr6JkqKt07rJdY2U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62115e7fe0ca7f001b70a97f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masakazu Uchi","original_name":"Masakazu Uchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62115e8b44a424006c6555bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuichiro Oka","original_name":"Yuichiro Oka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62115e94a84ff70020d5e9ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osamu Tomita","original_name":"Osamu Tomita","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62115e9cd100b6001b9e8f46","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hidenao Kubogi","original_name":"Hidenao Kubogi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62115ea3a24232006bffb0ed","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taiki Ueda","original_name":"Taiki Ueda","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62115eaef6fd18001c353076","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taiki Ueda","original_name":"Taiki Ueda","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62126ca24813820043809c5f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/10MEHvCphgirF2Dkcu2dRCtDGUk.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"2000 PFF Awards (22nd)","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
