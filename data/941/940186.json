Established during WWII and nicknamed the Triple Nickles, this elite unit would never battle overseas due to the racist attitudes of the day. Instead they served their country fighting a secret war in the Pacific Northwest as \"smokejumpers\" fighting forest fires during one of the worst fire seasons in US history. This is their story as told by one of their founding members, Second Lieutenant Walter Morris.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Jumping Into Fire\" tells the story of the only all African-American paratrooper unit in US Army history.","title":"Jumping into Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Morris","original_name":"Walter Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"2nd Lt.
