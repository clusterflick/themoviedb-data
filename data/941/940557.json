The documentary dramatizations are dedicated to the paradoxical periods of the protagonist's life: his leadership in a rebel unit, participation in the civil war of the early 1920s, his hiding from persecution under the guise of a Soviet police officer, his job as a factory construction worker. The stories about situations in the past are reproduced using the actions of contemporary characters: contemporary anarchists, officers of the New Police, students and workers. The filming took place at the locations of particular historical events, in Poltava, Hadiach, Kharkiv and Bohodukhiv.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tMudCOkAs5OF48rI9ekoIrgRYId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grey Horses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100b97e272600044df8ddc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100ba6a84ff7006d1f87c8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100bb1a84ff7006d1f87e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100bc44f9a99006c223849","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mykola Ridnyi","original_name":"Mykola Ridnyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100bccbe2d490040e8e4f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3432748,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pavlo Itkin","original_name":"Pavlo Itkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100bdc41465c001b815e4f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240584,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dmytro Pashko","original_name":"Dmytro Pashko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100beff9183a00707deebc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761374,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vadym Smarchenko","original_name":"Vadym Smarchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62100c02be2d49006cd3d690","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18277850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNwg0lR0KUDayPpErRvSzpsP5f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tMudCOkAs5OF48rI9ekoIrgRYId.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv (pre-premiere)","release_date":"2016-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Сірі коні / Grey Horses (trailer)","key":"276407934","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-06-22T09:16:48.000Z","id":"62100aa1aa78980042f7ba94"}]}}}
