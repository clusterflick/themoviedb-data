A young architect proposed a design for a 5-star hotel and new mosque. In 1971, his plans were scrapped. In 1982, a building began to be built. Hospital? Parking garage? Military housing? The project--now called the Basel al-Asad Center--has been the subject of much rumor and speculation. As of 2007, the building remains unfinished. In this documentary video, an architect recounts the chronicle of the building and considers its possible future.","popularity":0.0859,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Take into the air my quiet breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1891914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Meltzer","original_name":"Julia Meltzer","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/qCf5ieLru3DFm5l3hhDpRmVe1O6.jpg","credit_id":"620ff824d100b6001bdbf4be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688353,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Thorne","original_name":"David Thorne","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620ff8474c25920043492ba8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
