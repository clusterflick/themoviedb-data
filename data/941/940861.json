I don't mind if it's an imitation of Godard. The film begins with the words \"I don't care if it's an imitation of Godard\", and then a series of images that seem to imitate some film appear and disappear one after another. The film is interrupted by a sceptical narration, which pauses to describe the artist's anguish at not knowing how to end the film, even though he wants to. A light, self-assertive film that pretends to be a film imitation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/499yChvJn2YtKGBWhs5ulsj75k8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"END, END","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Suda","original_name":"Kazuhiro Suda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6211450b96670e006ba5b6bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Namba Masahiro","original_name":"Namba Masahiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62114511e72fe80043b59972","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Suda","original_name":"Kazuhiro Suda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6211450320e6a50042ba7a55","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Suda","original_name":"Kazuhiro Suda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621144f33e2ec80069edc599","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Suda","original_name":"Kazuhiro Suda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621144f9396e97006a8f0ab5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Suda","original_name":"Kazuhiro Suda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621144fe4c2592006ab5cb9a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kazuhiro Suda","original_name":"Kazuhiro Suda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621144eea84ff7006d22fbeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/499yChvJn2YtKGBWhs5ulsj75k8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
