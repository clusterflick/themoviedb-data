Young and Colleen Cohan star as the sadistic cannibalistic voodoo practicing husband and wife owners of a downtrodden convenience store. When local teens begin disappearing from the area it's up to a group of high school kids to play \"Scooby Doo\" and find out whodunit. But when all signs point to Gerald's Hungry Shack, our junior detectives realize that they're going to need a strong mind, a stronger stomach and plenty of sharp weapons to combat the deadly duo behind the counter and their large green dumpster out back, overflowing with dead teenagers!","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Green Monster","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward X.
