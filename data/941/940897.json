From the hilarious to the thought-provoking, all of the short films have an urban sense of humour, especially the second half, \"My right hand, my left foot and the back of my head at the age of 23\", which is full of wit and humour, firing like a machine gun. In the latter half of the film, the witty monologue and the rhythmical development of the images are beautifully synchronized, and the light but flexible \"23-year-old me\" speaks eloquently of his existence. Many of the film's gags are made up of deformed gags about the funny things that happen in the daily life of the author, a student, and the uniqueness of the characters makes this a film that will be loved by many people.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/41H9A7iYXke29zWjzW3Nc6e1x8F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"hi-lite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaaki Sumioka","original_name":"Masaaki Sumioka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"621151f5a84ff7006d232218","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shimada Kazuhisa","original_name":"Shimada Kazuhisa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"621151fbd100b6006c40087b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naganuma Hideyuki","original_name":"Naganuma Hideyuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6211521144a424006c65319f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","original_name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62115217a242320044c3bf59","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434187,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tanaka Toru","original_name":"Tanaka Toru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151cd396e97006a8f352c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","original_name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151d6aa7898001b6121e0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaaki Sumioka","original_name":"Masaaki Sumioka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6211519844a424006c65303f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaaki Sumioka","original_name":"Masaaki Sumioka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151ef1f0275006a6a9bf2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","original_name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151dea24232001cbe4473","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","original_name":"Yamamoto Yasuharu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151c0e72fe80043b5c204","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masaaki Sumioka","original_name":"Masaaki Sumioka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151a3d100b6006c40071b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kibe Toshio","original_name":"Kibe Toshio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621151b4e72fe80043b5c1f6","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/41H9A7iYXke29zWjzW3Nc6e1x8F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
