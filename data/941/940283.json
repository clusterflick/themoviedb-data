Choi Kyung Soo, who hails from Sokcho and moves to Seoul for college. Perhaps due to the pain he experienced during his high school days, Choi Kyung Soo has a hard time opening his heart to others.  The confident and cool Lee Hyun Jung [A] is admired by the other students at school and is more mature than most of her peers. When she and Choi Kyung Soo meet in a stargazing club, they develop feelings for each other that they are unable to express.  The hard-working and intelligent Lee Hyun Jung [B] was admitted to college at the top of her class and has little in common with Lee Hyun Jung [A] apart from their name and major. Lee Hyun Jung [B] finds herself drawn to the reserved Choi Kyung Soo, who always seems to keep a distance between himself and the other students at school, and she tries to bring him into her group of friends.","popularity":0.3695,"poster_path":"/kvLjPTS0vtl5zARLb49SFKuCZAc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92012,"logo_path":"/lGELj7l0lQpnbC4uYm3nX4jS4d1.png","name":"The LAMP","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Starlight Falls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esom","original_name":"이솜","popularity":0.8039,"profile_path":"/jFz4smLt7SwC4wdA8gdiKpXU7Kh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lee Hyun-jung A","credit_id":"620f885b1f0275001b82539c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1988291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ong Seong-wu","original_name":"옹성우","popularity":0.6462,"profile_path":"/4g1G3l9AmQlntojYnebc7MUOaQe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Choi Gyeong-su","credit_id":"620f8862f48e0d00428f2f4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shim Eun-kyung","original_name":"심은경","popularity":0.6238,"profile_path":"/kgtHFruNAjOuAuba3wXdYzYFzAW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lee Hyun-jung B","credit_id":"620f886ee0ca7f00436dc396","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Dong-geun","original_name":"양동근","popularity":0.8425,"profile_path":"/rpP06EPyDZBHKbwBhTo1t3J9poN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"620f887441465c006c59ebb2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1707304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Choi Kook-hee","original_name":"최국희","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/8TZmYRsEwL8sS64v1u1Qn9oPemw.jpg","credit_id":"620f889b41465c006c59ec09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kvLjPTS0vtl5zARLb49SFKuCZAc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":610}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
