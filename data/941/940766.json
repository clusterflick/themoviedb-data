We follow Scarlett, 17 years old, as she goes from getting pizza to getting chemotherapy. Having lost her mother years ago to cancer, Scarlett and her father endure tests of resilience, trust, and even a little rebellion. Cancer infects your body but it also infects your family, social life, and self-image. This film not only highlights specific aspects of cancer diagnosis and treatment but also shows the behind-closed-doors moments of a teenager realizing she isn't invincible.","popularity":0.2937,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3373071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Landman","original_name":"Casey Landman","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Scarlett","credit_id":"6211079b4c2592006ab4f35f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Mitchell","original_name":"Travis Mitchell","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"621107a7a84ff70020d4c632","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1802707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Piech","original_name":"Jennifer Piech","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/AvYlYNKHvBF5TCGwICTAvGFEkVf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"621107b71f0275001b86b300","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amna Vegha","original_name":"Amna Vegha","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"621107daa39d0b006c13f4f5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973040,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alison Hale","original_name":"Alison Hale","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621108059f1be70071095b88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Hale","original_name":"Alison Hale","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621107f61f02750042789005","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12374148","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Golden State Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
