Samsoelbahri goes to Batavia to study, while Noerbaja must marry the contemptuous Datuk Meringgih so that he will forgive her father's debts.  Writing to Samsoelbahri, Noerbaja tells him that they can never be together as she has married. However, when she realises Merringih's violent nature she runs away to Batavia to join Samsoelbahri. They fall in love again, but must part after Noerbaja hears of her father's death. She hurries back to Padang, where Meringgih's men kill her with poisoned food. Receiving news of her death by letter, Samsu seemingly commits suicide.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jv7F4PZU5ANJnbf9kIhM8P9Nsy8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Standard Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1941-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siti Noerbaja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asmanah","original_name":"Asmanah","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"620f11404c2592001bbe2782","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3357090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Momo","original_name":"Momo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"620f11554c2592004346dcf5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soerjono","original_name":"Soerjono","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"620f117aca0e17004279661f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2940952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A Thys","original_name":"A Thys","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"620f117ff90b19001d63afd3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"HA Rasjid","original_name":"HA Rasjid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"620f118bca0e17001b3fc5ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poniman","original_name":"Poniman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"620f12d8e0ca7f006ac8a6d5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3346074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lie Tek Swie","original_name":"Lie Tek Swie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620f119aa84ff700475234fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431619,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marah Roesli","original_name":"Marah Roesli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620f11c8396e97006a889f70","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Touw Ting Iem","original_name":"Touw Ting Iem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620f11af7ad08c0042d12f8a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jv7F4PZU5ANJnbf9kIhM8P9Nsy8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"1941-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
