Acclaimed photographer Latif al-Ani, born in Baghdad in 1932, is known as the father of Iraqi photography. As the official photographer for presidents and the Iraqi Petroleum Company, his portfolio forms a unique visual archive of Iraq during its heyday from the 1950s to 1970s.  His photos capture the abundance and complexity of a modern and cosmopolitan nation living in peace and harmony. But when Saddam Hussein rose to power, al-Ani stopped taking photos. After decades of war, al-Ani travels across Iraq with his photographs in search of the remnants of his beautiful country.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Iconic photographer Latif al-Ani travels across Iraq to find the people and places he took photos of before the wars.","title":"Iraq’s Invisible Beauty: Through Latif al-Ani’s Lens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5839986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latif al-Ani","original_name":"Latif al-Ani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6926c3c09e5d52773e2454bd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sahim Omar Kalifa","original_name":"Sahim Omar Kalifa","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":"/vWXmire2iAHw5u18tvvcDQOWov8.jpg","credit_id":"6926c39fec7b21006ed9c8e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2151206,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jurgen Buedts","original_name":"Jurgen Buedts","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926c3ae53eef8debf245305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
