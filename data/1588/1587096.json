To keep within my means, most of the shots were ony a second or two long. In retrospect, a still camera would have been more sensible. But I was in love also with film and with the possibilities of fast cutting. So what you get here is a stream of images from my walks: torn posters, shop signs, cinema hoardings, window displays, flea market merchandise. I appreciated the torn posters more in the spirit of Léo Malet's 'décollages' than Rotella's contemporary nouveau réalisme. Some years later, the Events of May 1968 broke out, covering the walls of the Left Bank with posters of protest. Recording them seemed a good way to end my film - just as they announced the beginning of a new cultural epoch.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bois-Charbons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Short","original_name":"Robert Short","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692542d5abfaa75736ea9834","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
