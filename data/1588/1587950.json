About doing something that sets us apart and makes an indelible claim about who we are. Gunnar Ryan Wiik is a dreamer. But what makes him stand out is that he is seemingly willing to do anything to make his dreams come through. Directors Even G. Benestad and August B. Hanssen has been following the Norwegian entrepreneur Gunnar Ryan Wiik since 2017 when his spectacular film project about the Western hero Morgan Kane collapsed and became front-page material in Norwegian newspapers.
