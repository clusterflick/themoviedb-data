Their meeting takes place in a coffee shop, where they have met many times before. The woman realizes that the man is still not indifferent to her. Seemingly trivial elements and gestures bring back memories. In the man's yellow socks, she suddenly sees all the different socks he once used to wear. A common gesture of him rolling up the sleeves multiplies in front of her eyes, as if the past was there together with the present. Their conversation briefly tells the story of their relationship.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2025-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Cups of Coffee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1888159,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Natalia Krawczuk","original_name":"Natalia Krawczuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926ccc27e2cd1388430cc13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
