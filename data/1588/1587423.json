In just under five minutes, Huyghe explores themes of agency, temporality, and identity: Annlee exists simultaneously as a digital “shell” and a vessel for projected emotions, highlighting the tension between a created character and the interpretations imposed by viewers and collaborators. Minimalist visuals and silent animation emphasize her ambiguous, haunting presence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zHBTzG33JFKeEdPwbE6WK08mEll.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Minutes Out of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Huyghe","original_name":"Pierre Huyghe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/cUNy3jtEVobQbmJyuZ7nkmXdBcR.jpg","credit_id":"6925d9dffe92dbc9a7ea9b52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zHBTzG33JFKeEdPwbE6WK08mEll.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
