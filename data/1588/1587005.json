This vibrant community of free-spirited, close-knit residents will be transformed as part of an urban renewal project aimed at addressing the Dutch housing crisis. The plan involves raising the sinking land with seven meters of sand to prepare it for conventional housing, earning the area its nickname, 'The Sinking Fringe.' Through interviews and archival footage, the film offers an intimate portrait of a hidden neighborhood caught between hope and fear, grappling with an uncertain future while fighting to secure its rightful place in Amsterdam’s evolving urban landscape.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sinking Fringe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5837603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirte Jepma","original_name":"Mirte Jepma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924fb9033220d1d62d9c202","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
