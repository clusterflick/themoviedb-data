Benedito Silveira, a representative of a European firm interested in Alberto's products, flirted with Clarinda, despite being relatively old. If Clarinda's heart belonged to him, the problem of the accumulated inventory would be solved. However, Clarinda either didn't want to, or couldn't understand, Benedito's romantic intentions. She spent her time outings with Laura, a highly experienced aviator and her childhood friend. The factory's growing crisis forced the shareholders to meet frequently. Employee layoffs were inevitable. Antonio Martins was a young shareholder who spent most of his time in clubs and cabarets. Introduced to Clarinda, he began to court her, eventually declaring his love. But Clarinda thought of no other affection than that of her adoptive father.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rSDqDbZBgpaUAplZZTQuUEadpiE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Filme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quando Elas Querem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2224064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Fronzi","original_name":"César Fronzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Antonio Martins","credit_id":"6925cca08166dc3e50ea9931","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Letti","original_name":"Laura Letti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Clarinda","credit_id":"6925ccb4b8ebbf3ee7371236","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertoli Carmelo","original_name":"Bertoli Carmelo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Alberto da Silva","credit_id":"6925cccd7e7d6aedcc371118","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvador Tarantino","original_name":"Salvador Tarantino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Benedito Silveira","credit_id":"6925cceaabfaa75736ea9ace","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emílio Marangoni","original_name":"Emílio Marangoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Luis Teixeira","credit_id":"6925cd050e552cc66b371133","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2016094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anésia Pinheiro Machado","original_name":"Anésia Pinheiro Machado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gi2VOlu2Oua7hYL1wYnfBX1WAWN.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Laura Ferreira","credit_id":"6925cd659e8bdd43ea245045","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2224065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolanda Fronzi","original_name":"Yolanda Fronzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6925cd159e8bdd43ea245042","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jardel Jércolis","original_name":"Jardel Jércolis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6925cd28efce93e70526ba4d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luiz de Barros","original_name":"Luiz de Barros","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/r0gDJn8h6y1anhIW7R8fBFkEdg7.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6925cd3cc578854951c11a74","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Fuina","original_name":"Regina Fuina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6925cd4ed8135ae325a75282","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"E.C.
