Earth is gone, and the ship, once a vessel of hope, now carries only failure and silence. As oxygen fades, Elias begins a calm mission log, clinging to duty and procedure. But as systems die around him, the truth surfaces: he isn’t just facing his own death, he’s witnessing the extinction of mankind.  In his final moments, the soldier becomes a storyteller, offering not a plea for rescue but a quiet eulogy for the human race. As the ship falls silent, his voice becomes the last echo of humanity, ending with a single, hopeful line:  “I hope the stars remember us.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tS9CgxsIxHxQWdaqh1SRusc0rSW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silvermont Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Final Transmission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4144185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Swale","original_name":"Tom Swale","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Elias Walker","credit_id":"692592af8719ef65d730c761","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3573968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Coleman","original_name":"Sean Coleman","popularity":0.7417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692592e377cc5b7167244dfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3573968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Coleman","original_name":"Sean Coleman","popularity":0.7417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692592f0424deecd3226b866","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tS9CgxsIxHxQWdaqh1SRusc0rSW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
