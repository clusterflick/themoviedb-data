However, in reality, this is a cluster of small, broken, dissected walls and facades alike those that the artist uses in her animated puppet films. Besides highlighting the indexicality of the filmic space, this work reflects on the idea that home (for this author) is not a fixed place and a stronghold, but an illusionistic hideaway, where the fragmented space of the miniature holds such attributes as a fragile feeling of security.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3838905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Vidaković","original_name":"Lea Vidaković","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926cbe7a3259bb26037140f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
