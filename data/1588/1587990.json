A young mushroom discovers the beauty of nature with curiosity. His neighbor, an old, grumpy toadstool, shows little joy in company or nature. Undeterred, the young mushroom seeks closeness – until a sentence from the old man changes everything: \"They'll eat you!\" Before he even understands what that means, the mushroom is torn from the ground and finds himself in a nightmare: knives, pots, fire – a kitchen full of dead mushrooms. Desperately fighting for survival, he manages to escape and return to the clearing. The old fly agaric can hardly believe that the little one has made it. For the first time in a long time, his heart warms.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/eyKxNA8XBs5gzviqbzqsoUe1RqZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule der Medien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Ungeniessbar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Celine Fetzer","original_name":"Celine Fetzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926f4c4a359fdf101c12014","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kristina Fusuljevic","original_name":"Kristina Fusuljevic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926f4cc9274012db030cdc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Schnellbacher","original_name":"Marc Schnellbacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926f4d44a9cac5d21245481","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kristina Fusuljevic","original_name":"Kristina Fusuljevic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926f4db4a9cac5d21245484","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840190,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilja Soutchilin","original_name":"Ilja Soutchilin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926f4e9da82e265a8248a3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840191,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luise Kaufmann","original_name":"Luise Kaufmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926f4f18518a818f3c11fb6","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eyKxNA8XBs5gzviqbzqsoUe1RqZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
