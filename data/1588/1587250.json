Situated in Northeastern Kenya, it accommodates approximately 500,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia. A great number of these people have lived there most of their lives, trying to survive in congested and seemingly hopeless conditions. For those who know little more than life inside the camps, the outside word is just an 'abstract thought', far away from daily reality. Both the invisible and the real gates of Dadaab have made hundreds of thousands of people feel like prisoners, losing hope for the future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Somali","iso_639_1":"so","name":"Somali"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Flew Over Dadaab","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andre Vltchek","original_name":"Andre Vltchek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692596c6d40012ae11d9c47b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14041056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":973,"name":"refugee camp"},{"id":4265,"name":"somalia"},{"id":15053,"name":"united nations"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
