The images in the lower sequence are close-up shots of the concrete surfaces of the underside of the bridge. The patterns of light on these surfaces are created by the movements of water below the bridge. Their appearance is affected by changes in the sky's cloud cover and undulations in the water's surface caused by the wind.The work is the result of spending time studying this landscape through a camera lens. The idea behind it is not new, and reflects an observation by the British painter Paul Nash in 1938 when he wrote: “The landscapes I have in mind are not part of the unseen world in the psychic sense, nor are they part of the Unconscious. They belong to the world that lies, visibly, about us. They are unseen merely because they are not perceived; only in that way can they be regarded as invisible.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light under a bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3283756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Payne","original_name":"Andrew Payne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6924f9c48b2b71636a26b656","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
