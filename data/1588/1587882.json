Known as Quemado, he prevents the marriage of a girl to a notorious desperado and meets Joanna Thatcher, an eastern girl to whom he makes the promise that she will someday come to love him. Joan becomes engaged to Gretorix, unwilling to admit to herself that she has become infatuated with the daring horseman. On Joan's wedding day, Quemado kidnaps her, forces her to admit that she loves him, and arranges to be wed by a parson on horseback as they ride furiously into the hills to avoid the pursuit of the angry Gretorix.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/t3xT2cjGIs3P7JlzR0hNK4OQPyf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Devil Quemado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Aquele Diabo do Quemado","type":"Brazilian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Don Quemado - den mystiske Rytter","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Un redresseur de torts","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Thomson","original_name":"Fred Thomson","popularity":0.1828,"profile_path":"/lyV7ji1lgWFOe0VR5KbmV9mTdSe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Quemado","credit_id":"6926db463fd87ae1a3d9c949","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Prisco","original_name":"Albert Prisco","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/5tLw9gqgrIbcKDYnPepLf3CkPIC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"José Ramériz","credit_id":"6926db5f74773253cc37156b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nola Luxford","original_name":"Nola Luxford","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/mfjp30vsRHoWmpNoXycu7nbSjjg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Conchita Ramériz","credit_id":"6926db74eedb15746e26be44","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1556710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Douglas","original_name":"Byron Douglas","popularity":0.5605,"profile_path":"/6i6XRZMHYN1Qu0H8rq2YzssBkIs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Thatcher","credit_id":"6926db867485f78501a75753","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3461663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Bell","original_name":"Joseph Bell","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ned Thatcher","credit_id":"6926dbb2a8eeb62a2cc11f77","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1302584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Hope","original_name":"Gloria Hope","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/aiNxjH8kqoC43KIt1yNYKFoPfhK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joanna Thatcher","credit_id":"6926dbc9d40012ae11d9cb22","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Roscoe","original_name":"Alan Roscoe","popularity":0.2379,"profile_path":"/r7dI0JkuISCWV7rVbPqWgDMMEtB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gretorix","credit_id":"6926dbdadf1ecfb3b2371573","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cauterio","original_name":"Robert Cauterio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Juan Gonzales","credit_id":"6926dbef159e8c918226bcf9","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2003,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Del Andrews","original_name":"Del Andrews","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926dc0692edc640ed248a04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5840096,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marvin Wilhite","original_name":"Marvin Wilhite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926dc1aa8eeb62a2cc11f82","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023446,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ross Fisher","original_name":"Ross Fisher","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6926dc2bcb2c58a363c11ebd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred L.
