Mixing location footage from Blackburn, Norwich, and Oxford with unexpectedly quirky presentation, the film contrasts small-scale housing improvements with the sweeping redevelopment schemes of the post-war era. Produced as a government public information film and shown at meetings between planners, architects, and residents, it stands as a modest, humane entry in Britain’s civic-minded documentary tradition.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/o5SqgfslBpE9izKSZLvyaX87ij7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272972,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Wide
