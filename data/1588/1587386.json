Opowieść fantastyczna","overview":"The film “Kobro / Strzemiński. A Fantastic Tale” enters into a dialogue with biographism as a method of interpreting art, while also showing that it is impossible to escape biographism entirely. Its creators recognize the value in the attitude of avant-garde artists, which lay in overcoming life’s adversities and pushing their imagination beyond what others consider an insurmountable horizon.  In this film, nothing is as it actually happened—and this not-happening is intentional. By watching situations that never took place, we can draw conclusions about the things that did. The viewer steps into the role of a detective, because a crime has been committed in this story. Among the suspects are: Fanny Kaplan, who attempted to take Lenin’s life; Fritz Haber, the father of chemical warfare, and his wife, who took her own life in despair; as well as the cities Paris, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Łódź.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kobro / Strzemiński.
