As a consequence, he is free only on weekends while Barbara is influenced by a jazz set and spends most of her time at fashionable resorts. Although Barbara remains faithful to her husband, she goes canoeing with another man and nearly drowns when their canoe is hit by a yacht. Gossipers at the resort convince William that Barbara was cheating and he should leave her. She goes to Paris, France, while Federal agents arrest Randall and release him under bail. Meanwhile Barbara, left alone, sends for her husband, who, instead of replying, catches the first plane to Paris. Barbara has already taken poison, but she recovers when Randall arrives and they return to America together.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fUZeMYaKyzp4QcVGKErWMfgX6wS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daniel Carson Goodman","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Week End Husbands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Part-Time Husbands","type":"UK title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holmes Herbert","original_name":"Holmes Herbert","popularity":0.3466,"profile_path":"/oCvbtPpsOEdrFLR6be8qkRfOZ3x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"William Randall","credit_id":"6926e755172f2114a7c11e46","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Rubens","original_name":"Alma Rubens","popularity":0.5138,"profile_path":"/5E4uO4iO6cw0FsOL2oUcytqM1XN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Barbara Belden","credit_id":"6926e767798d54bbe2c11f63","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montagu Love","original_name":"Montagu Love","popularity":0.3475,"profile_path":"/aCOahFpYdCKMOg8RO9jMsFOA5xx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Thomas Mowry","credit_id":"6926e7790c1ed72ae8a756b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.3033,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Keane","credit_id":"6926e7899c61967f36a756e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Crute","original_name":"Sally Crute","popularity":0.2563,"profile_path":"/j4EAUflh93T6hlZV0eSvTS2XFtx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Dawn","credit_id":"6926e79d16e39e99c1a75789","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Byer","original_name":"Charles Byer","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Stover","credit_id":"6926e7b01dd378966bd9c9bd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Panzer","original_name":"Paul Panzer","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/6NhO8FSFg6azBGaga5IaSNaUNEs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Monsieur La Rue","credit_id":"6926e7c9a298fb991b30cd5c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Dale","original_name":"Margaret Dale","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/cFDWwYy1Kkhrb8l9XL1GyBvqdWS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Sarah Belden","credit_id":"6926e7dba63269fd1f30cd10","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":253066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward H.
