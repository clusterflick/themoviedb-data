Naomi next makes the acquaintance of a crook who is attempting to steal her jewels, and she persuades him to help her rob Richard's safe. Richard catches Naomi red-handed, but--rather than turn her in--he decides to reform her. Instead, they fall in love, Richard learns Naomi's true purpose in her attempted robbery, and Mr. Warren's forgery is forever secreted with the marriage of Naomi and Richard.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t37apiYoDyUnLHhnxpeQAHjznTa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tilford Cinema Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slim Shoulders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Hendes store Kup","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"女性の意気","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Castle","original_name":"Irene Castle","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/gHHsxjXFNqpLfHB78odcPVdka8T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Naomi Warren","credit_id":"692595a81b5237443c371030","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod La Rocque","original_name":"Rod La Rocque","popularity":0.1834,"profile_path":"/7cmambpDRIRDQmIXPbLszOypbYr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Langden","credit_id":"692595bdb9b5c3e284ea9901","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anders Randolf","original_name":"Anders Randolf","popularity":0.4427,"profile_path":"/huOktIxFNvOJEFe3KoBm2FretJr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Edward Langden","credit_id":"692595cf5de0152cf2248591","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Cook","original_name":"Warren Cook","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/dSIjJucRiF4ZZ630CW3EARbRK4H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Clinton Warren","credit_id":"692595e32952522785244ecc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Carillo","original_name":"Mario Carillo","popularity":0.1602,"profile_path":"/tyxGEyyLcZZjP4h0Dio6v2DZaGY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Count Giulo Morranni","credit_id":"692595f9e2582f4674d9c423","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Burke","original_name":"Marie Burke","popularity":0.3054,"profile_path":"/6BN5PXZsScoZGiPMp9EYN011CRO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Warren","credit_id":"6925960f181196092f370fe6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Crosland","original_name":"Alan Crosland","popularity":0.2501,"profile_path":"/jqvqh7gg871bgsQxaZH0pJqtkue.jpg","credit_id":"69259635d8135ae325a750ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2077621,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Harris","original_name":"Charles Harris","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692596459e8bdd43ea244f1b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lawrence McCloskey","original_name":"Lawrence McCloskey","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6925965e000b8dd82ca750fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George J.
