Earth is gone, and the ship, once a vessel of hope, now carries only failure and silence. As oxygen fades, Elias begins a calm mission log, clinging to duty and procedure. But as systems die around him, the truth surfaces: he isn’t just facing his own death, he’s witnessing the extinction of mankind.  In his final moments, the soldier becomes a storyteller, offering not a plea for rescue but a quiet eulogy for the human race. As the ship falls silent, his voice becomes the last echo of humanity, ending with a single, hopeful line:  “I hope the stars remember us.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Final Transmission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
