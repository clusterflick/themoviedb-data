She wears a black mourning gown as she addresses the history of her city, the construction of identity, and the tension between half-public, half-private spaces. Paired with ominous clicking sounds and halting breaths, the video evokes a vision of a fragile, haunted subject caught between memory and architecture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cU6ZQajl7k37PF6Xg6IZKjfzedp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annlee You Proposes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Gillick","original_name":"Liam Gillick","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6925d42db579088f9b248565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cU6ZQajl7k37PF6Xg6IZKjfzedp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Liam Gillick, Annlee You Proposes, 2001","key":"769427345","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-10T12:54:11.000Z","id":"6925d4dd744371e84ba75282"}]}}}
