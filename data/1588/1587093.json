It adopted a ritualised shooting style which involved walking ten paces, waiting for an event or ‘interruption’ to occur in frame, which would then prompt a 10 second shot of film. This took place from dawn to nightfall, beginning in the lower outskirts of the village and ending at the hilltop chapel. In the interim, the camera explores the narrow, whitewashed alleys that circle the hill.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
