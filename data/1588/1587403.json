Drawing on Belhaj‑Kacem’s Trickster Theory, the work positions Annlee as a “trickster” figure—simultaneously created and agentic, structured and subversive. The video examines identity, authorship, and the game-like dynamics of virtual existence, exploring how a character bound by commercial and artistic frameworks might assert a form of strategic freedom. Through sound, text, and visual minimalism, it turns Annlee’s supposed “shell” into a stage for critique, ambiguity, and philosophical inquiry.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trickster Theory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5838609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Joseph","original_name":"Pierre Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6925d2c14779d992ddd9c698","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehdi Belhaj Kacem","original_name":"Mehdi Belhaj Kacem","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6925d2d4529ddef13426b97c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
