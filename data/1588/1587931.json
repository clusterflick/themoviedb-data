Crawford comes west with his daughter, Jean, and attempts to break the elder Sethman's opposition. Dave saves Jean from a runaway horse and later protects her when Murdock, Crawford's unprincipled assistant, makes unwanted advances. Sethman plans to rustle Crawford's cattle and is mortally wounded by him, telling Dave, as he lies dying, that Crawford is Dave's real father from whom he was stolen as an infant. Dave and Crawford are reconciled, and Crawford, whom Dave has shot in the hand, tells the boy that Jean is his adopted daughter, leaving the way free for a romance between the young people.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/viwzBwkhPXyKmk5ZJ61fWmtJq5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Texas Bearcat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"O Mestiço","type":"Portuguese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Custer","original_name":"Bob Custer","popularity":0.2705,"profile_path":"/7eJDFfFBYki6nDErCtekBPYHNgL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dave Sethman","credit_id":"6926e269d8a34bb1fe370fe2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Rand","original_name":"Sally Rand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/y0BTxZOf0G24fJ9A5vnfXoL8EQ7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Crawford","credit_id":"6926e2796a65040263c11fca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry von Meter","original_name":"Harry von Meter","popularity":0.3051,"profile_path":"/memFnJZxuWx0PYxibqi5JyBhKZV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Crawford","credit_id":"6926e28ff27adf435ad9c9ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Richardson","original_name":"Jack Richardson","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/VS5D9sFzk4KTeFjsL1Y15Ck4yb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Watson","credit_id":"6926e2a10e552cc66b3715c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlton S.
