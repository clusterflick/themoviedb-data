When street performances fail to support their frenzied escape they resort to scamming sabong matches with a scheme adopted from a Mark Twain short story. Comical quibbling over criminal strategies and ethical choices adds spice to the tale as the trio remain true-blue whenever the going get rough. A gritty coming-of-age adventure comedy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Country Singers Cross the Line","title":"Feather Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37472340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Feather Wars Official Trailer (short)","key":"E30ezFLSDs0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-11-13T03:11:46.000Z","id":"69266f76edf0c4b6d6c11d7a"}]}}}
