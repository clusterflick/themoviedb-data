For him, it's an agrosport and a path to the title of \"Pumpkin King.\" Last year, Sasha set a Russian record with his 817-kilogram pumpkin. This year, he truly believes his pumpkin will not only weigh over a ton but also become the heaviest in the world. After all, he's already purchased a selective seed at auction and built a greenhouse with heat pumps, a heating system, irrigation, and ventilation.
