Also feeling herself slighted, Gay innocently flirts with Juan Camillo but is caught in a compromising situation and is sent away by John. Gay, forbidden to see her son, is penniless and miserable, while John also is unhappy and takes to drink. Gay slips into Master's house during a night of revelry to see Jackie, whom she rescues from playing the role of a cupid for the entertainment of the guests. Gay then upbraids John, who repents and asks forgiveness, thus reuniting the family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2VWeNPkxHAC1HCIxtW9qnvedBek.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14950,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.P.
