In this film, the stories of 35 kids from the Point, gathered at scripting workshops, are woven into a narrative structure by screenwriters, and the kids play themselves in front of the camera. The result is a remarkable drama about one fated weekend when the teenagers' lives unexpectedly intersect to solve a mystery that has haunted their neighbourhood for years. A truly collaborative process from page to screen, The Point gives sound and vision to these teenagers born on the wrong side of the tracks.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Point","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Dorsey","original_name":"Joshua Dorsey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a288f1fb94f00373bb295","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0485026","wikidata_id":"Q7757594","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
