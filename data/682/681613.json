His films showcase narration from VJ Emmie, who offers wry running commentary — hyping the director, cheering on the heroes, mocking the villains, and, most exhilarating of all, speaking directly to the viewer, making us feel as if we’re accessories to the production. IGG Nabwana, VJ Emmie, and the Wakaliwood family have created a special presentation for the True/False audience. You won’t want to miss this one-time-only experience.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Movie","title":"A Supa Special Wakaliwood Event for All True/False Commandos","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
