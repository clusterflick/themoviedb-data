A modernist architectural marvel, the city is a sparkling wasteland of machine dreams and aging monuments to a utopian future. Highlighting the sacred geometry of triangles and symmetry of lines, this sci-fi flick interrogates the semiotic structures that undergird the Martian outpost. With striking visuals and a thumping, electronic soundtrack, A Machine to Live In is a transcendent, transcendental voyage through Brazil’s cosmic capital.","popularity":0.0917,"poster_path":"/b0fzhJ7oBFCBjt90AJi8MuYZW2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Machine to Live in","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Carvalho","original_name":"Vladimir Carvalho","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":"/rcmUqW0SQAEgOi0YTFc0xKxRTTM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5f970ca51cc4ff0035450fd9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916459,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoni Goldstein","original_name":"Yoni Goldstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e63d55555c92600155d68c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meredith Zielke","original_name":"Meredith Zielke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e63d56c151c5c0015fddc4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616018,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastián Álvarez","original_name":"Sebastián Álvarez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f96a1b5bd32090038f124bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830741,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew Benz","original_name":"Andrew Benz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f96a1c90792e100355a3078","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iva Radivojević","original_name":"Iva Radivojević","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/qCY07kuwF1Tb3SrMLG8nUjPqxeQ.jpg","credit_id":"5f96a1e66cf3d50035e74b1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Oliveira Pita","original_name":"Stefan Oliveira Pita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f96a1fb2fe2fa0038b076ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12214738","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1396,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b0fzhJ7oBFCBjt90AJi8MuYZW2c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":931},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q0set5qenUkU2sZoAKCf5jjtzIA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prismatic Ground","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
