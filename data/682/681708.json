Spiraling out from there, the story breaks into an unconventional and tangential narrative about love, hustlers, desire, drugs, conspiracy, film scripts, and the actress ZoÃ« Lund. Head and Hands is a fascinating look at the obsessive forces at play and self-destructive tendencies that often accompany creative brilliance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zsbEyrU46uMsIEh3aRNznnlvrom.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head and Hands: My Black Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aida Ruilova","original_name":"Aida Ruilova","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e65809d357c00001338bb58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3181902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zsbEyrU46uMsIEh3aRNznnlvrom.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
