The film seems to be the result of a mischievous prism that sometimes multiplies the image, sometimes associates it with others. By combining colourful shots bordering on the abstract with ambient sounds, the filmmaker proposes a personal variation on a documentary tradition: that of the urban symphony. The visual stream is as precarious as the electric current and it happens that darkness invites itself onto the screen without warning. The images echo each other or are sometimes attuned to create veritable triptychs.","popularity":0.1196,"poster_path":"/qlxeaSzZMSCePog1gc6XQBHylpT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138775,"logo_path":"/tSBW8Pe1xqGbdube0a2jnfzZNKP.png","name":"Twenty Nine Studio & Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2019-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Homemade battery packs and snaking power cables connect citizens of Kinshasa resisting darkness.","title":"Up at Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Makengo","original_name":"Nelson Makengo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e63ae9555c92600175d35f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosa Spaliviero","original_name":"Rosa Spaliviero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3cffe49590e3003372972e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Makengo","original_name":"Nelson Makengo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3cffec9590e3003471d43b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2559275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Makengo","original_name":"Nelson Makengo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3cffd89ae613003644f274","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13793394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qlxeaSzZMSCePog1gc6XQBHylpT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA)","release_date":"2019-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Holland Island International Debut Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Up At Night by Nelson Makengo_TRAILER","key":"365796501","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-11T15:13:47.000Z","id":"5f3d006fad59b500361b9d21"}]}}}
