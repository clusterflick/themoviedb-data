Given a time-frame, we would say somewhere between the American moonwalk, and Coca- Cola's serious ambition to turn the moon into an advertising logo. Our central character, the young lift operator, is formed by experience into cynicism, detachment, and apathy. The story builds to its crescendo: of public outrage and state crackdown; the banality of commercial interest and the monumental rape of nature. Set in a large newspaper office, the Lift is a place of relative safety. But floor by floor, with each passenger in his or her tableau, the atmosphere of mayhem seeps in. Finally our young character leaves the situation, far-gone in hopelessness and disinterest.","popularity":0.1652,"poster_path":"/6Js91MFnkgMDmQZIo2GaaNE0391.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aufzug","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel-Frantisek Kamen","original_name":"Daniel-Frantisek Kamen","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/pP6jejcnqrfun25rZrnAd20kANf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sven","credit_id":"5e68b73555c9260019642c5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Spencer","original_name":"Tomas Spencer","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/16iYGI12p54gE7fwk2GmzC8mCzu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"5e68b722151c5c001304be12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1824017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Baum","original_name":"Robert Baum","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Assistant Müller","credit_id":"5e68b7512f3b1700113e3909","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2562859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Brehse","original_name":"Philip Brehse","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Otto","credit_id":"5e68b771151c5c001304becc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2562869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Däbritz","original_name":"Manuel Däbritz","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Hoffmeister","credit_id":"5e68ba29151c5c00190448a6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Faust","original_name":"Daniel Faust","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/vg0VXMhaLjMGbrmH0zCEDBV3VBz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Police Officer","credit_id":"5e68ba3d55c92600196430a4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Gehrlinger","original_name":"Maximilian Gehrlinger","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/7tgxTS29b5BwTmB9DvYUumPEyv2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Liftboy 2","credit_id":"5e68ba562f3b1700173dee45","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1644784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Harting","original_name":"Christian Harting","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/k8KFBJDfVgyhLtFLWIQhvgaBzDV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Commissar","credit_id":"5e68ba82357c0000133d757d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Heinrich","original_name":"Benjamin Heinrich","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/6xZ8wqtURNtCzqVY08N5fvcg9xL.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Assistant Koffer","credit_id":"5e68bb4f55c926001365ff23","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2562880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Koudys","original_name":"Matthew Koudys","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Respectable Male","credit_id":"5e68bb6e357c0000133d78c8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2562881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Krause-Grégoire","original_name":"Sylvie Krause-Grégoire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Patrycia","credit_id":"5e68bb88151c5c0019044a2f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Krogmann","original_name":"Stephanie Krogmann","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/2hOT11hgTAzOGXiwgB5uYWDDi8P.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Respectable female","credit_id":"5e68bb9d55c9260019643314","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2562884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holger Liedtke","original_name":"Holger Liedtke","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Herr Bornemann","credit_id":"5e68bbb6357c0000133d78fa","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1724722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Meisner","original_name":"Robin Meisner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Liftboy","credit_id":"5e68bbc92f3b1700173df14a","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus A.
