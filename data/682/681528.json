This is the question the multi-talented composer Flint Juventino Beppe – formerly known as Fred Jonny Berg – has set out to answer. The album Remote Galaxy is a journey in time and space, a journey given meaning by the album's music and philosophy. The music is uncompromisingly honest, with a genuine power of its own. Using well-known acoustic technology, the composer takes us to some unusual and, for most of us, unknown places.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/z1jPgzaRvx4rWIOx6RnHTZpeYKw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"REMOTE GALAXY by Flint Juventino Beppe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9CtSB5iIK4vp79HQSfi89ivesO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z1jPgzaRvx4rWIOx6RnHTZpeYKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
