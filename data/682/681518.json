The path to fame was indeed uphill for Norway's leading modernist. However, Valen's diffidence was not the only reason for this - another was his chosen musical language, which grew out of the twelve-tone method of composition associated with Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. By writing this sort of music, albeit with his own highly personal stamp, he was asking for trouble in the conservative world of Norwegian music.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5cp3O8DHZ49iQInFReljzla90RQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fartein Valen string quartets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x78VwUB64LDerpo3sMBqNNHo1AC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5cp3O8DHZ49iQInFReljzla90RQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
