As none knows him and perhaps he knows nothing about himself.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2he1uINoAAL6TDRjGvZ78J05tLc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nobody Looks Beyond the Shadow","title":"Heroes of the Flicks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559623,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dionysia Arvanitou","original_name":"Dionysia Arvanitou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e640ee1459ad60013581469","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2461732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panagiotis Kountouras","original_name":"Panagiotis Kountouras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/r1sihUCBhMoDuQkBxHD5z9aom31.jpg","credit_id":"5e640eef459ad6001358147c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2461732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panagiotis Kountouras","original_name":"Panagiotis Kountouras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/r1sihUCBhMoDuQkBxHD5z9aom31.jpg","credit_id":"5e640eca151c5c0015fe303d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2294469","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2he1uINoAAL6TDRjGvZ78J05tLc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"London Greek Film Festival","release_date":"2012-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"14th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2012-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
