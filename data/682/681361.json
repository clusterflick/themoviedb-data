The film is focused around a band (RIPHOUSE) from Congers, a hamlet within the county. Based just thirty minutes out of NYC the band had everything going for them, except themselves. Beginning as a local high school cover band they quickly began writing original material that inspired a community of their peers. On the cusp of breaking through to the national circuit their founder and front man veered down a life changing path which his band members could not follow. Filled with truth, fame, success, drugs, and death, Could've Been's & Wanna Be's is the story of the house that ripped and the family that died. Narrated by the band members themselves and including interviews with 30+ people including Rob Dukes of Exodus and Don La Greca of ESPN Radio.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/uhq206Ne5Hi3XTbwDKP1pyzZ0DP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They're gonna be the biggest thing since Trixter","title":"Riphouse 151: Could've Been's & Wanna Be's","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Clancy","original_name":"Mike Clancy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e63fc1f459ad60018577db0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim DeMaria","original_name":"Jim DeMaria","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e63fc35357c000011364926","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Galvin","original_name":"Joe Galvin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e63fc44f36a32001a6eeae3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2559537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Eleazar","original_name":"Jon Eleazar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e63fc5555c92600175db39f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter O'Brien","original_name":"Peter O'Brien","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/RHPVJW5kx1jYJJ9ChImT1KWaNz.jpg","credit_id":"5e63fbf055c92600155d95d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter O'Brien","original_name":"Peter O'Brien","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/RHPVJW5kx1jYJJ9ChImT1KWaNz.jpg","credit_id":"5e63fc8755c92600175db42a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1896529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter O'Brien","original_name":"Peter O'Brien","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/RHPVJW5kx1jYJJ9ChImT1KWaNz.jpg","credit_id":"5e63fc973e01ea0015ea1b3f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uhq206Ne5Hi3XTbwDKP1pyzZ0DP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
