It would take just 13 months to irrevocably change the course of global history and introduce the world to a new era of modern terrorism. The Islamic Republic of Iran rose up from an unlikely revolution in a country that had never seen financial crisis, disgruntled military, or faced defeat in war.\r Radical Obsession explores the transformation of Iran from a western-influenced monarchy to a modern orthodox theocracy. It investigates how Ayatollah Khomeini's vision for a society shaped by a ruling council of Imams radically upset the balance of power in the Middle East: a vision that reignited an age-old sectarian struggle for dominance of the Muslim world while spreading a deadly current of fear and an unyielding mission of state-sponsored terrorism.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radical Obsession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
