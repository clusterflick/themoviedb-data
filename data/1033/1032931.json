Together with the heroes, we walk around Moscow at night, go on an ethnographic expedition, attend a rehearsal. We live this hour with unusual people for whom folklore has become something more than just music. The picturesque landscapes give way to the naughty dance of youth; the grandmothers' song takes us deep into the past and seems so close and so dear.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Native Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3731122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stepan Voronezhsky","original_name":"Stepan Voronezhsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340ae91e4b576007bfcac4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
