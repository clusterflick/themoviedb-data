Michelle’s father is the late Dr. Robert Moog (1934 - 2005), a true American innovator who is arguably the most important figure in the history of electronic music, through his invention of the now legendary Moog synthesizer. Michelle, a devoted Moog archivist and historian, has dedicated her life to her father’s legacy, as founder and Executive Director of The Bob Moog Foundation. Through Michelle’s eyes, we glimpse the places and meet the people who were a part of Moog’s history, experiencing a firsthand account of Bob Moog’s incredible sonic journey... from his childhood in New York, to his introduction to the world of electronic music, and through the incredible ups and downs of his company, Moog Music. Michelle’s voyage is an effort to reconcile the father she knew, with the world-famous music icon.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/dv0VJc7i2A9qtJAut8w1i1bVlIy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waveshaper Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Electronic Voyager: Retracing Bob Moog's Sonic Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Moog-Koussa","original_name":"Michelle Moog-Koussa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"634022e12f3b170084112d65","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205419,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Fantinatto","original_name":"Robert Fantinatto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634022f5e04d8a0081286fb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205709,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jason Amm","original_name":"Jason Amm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340230c4350110082a0e327","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205709,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jason Amm","original_name":"Jason Amm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634023120859b4008139550b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205419,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Fantinatto","original_name":"Robert Fantinatto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634022fe140bad0079f00476","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7875420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dv0VJc7i2A9qtJAut8w1i1bVlIy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Electronic Voyager: Retracing Bob Moog’s Sonic Journey - OFFICIAL TRAILER","key":"zPDt592I1po","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-01T02:26:41.000Z","id":"6340239c4350110082a0e360"}]}}}
