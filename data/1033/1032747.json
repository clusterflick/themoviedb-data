The plot line runs through many layers of complications both in Devika's personal life and her place in society, as she fights with her family, quarrels and distances herself from Kishore, marries another man under social pressures and much more. The movie makes the point that instead of behaving like meek sheep under social influences, we must understand every individual's perspective from our own point of view. The movie ends on a happy note where Kishore and Devika both stand against the blind and illogical superstitious mentality and are finally reunited.","popularity":0.1302,"poster_path":"/k0eOVYcY7N4kjkVkwkdtkN5PFpc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1987-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devika","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"देविका","type":"Hindi"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aparna Sen","original_name":"Aparna Sen","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/zAyctze9LUC51ujXJvZ6x9uZHSG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6340212e0859b4007957bb4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1619216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ranjit Mallick","original_name":"Ranjit Mallick","popularity":0.3436,"profile_path":"/wT95BT8W3gtRXvJ8gNH3kdtHilY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63402139e04d8a0081286f13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1094825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kali Bannerjee","original_name":"Kali Bannerjee","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/uUz3Lk0NhxlhhKG51VjvrITUZ52.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63402158d35dea008179acad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nimu Bhowmick","original_name":"Nimu Bhowmick","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/b94CcJKEIpeh0svGAnS7aiqxly8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63402162c39266008378abed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dilip Roy","original_name":"Dilip Roy","popularity":0.1218,"profile_path":"/n6xhjy3fPI4zX4cQUKKsl391Ujd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6340216e4350110082a0e291","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730629,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sumana Devi","original_name":"Sumana Devi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340219b140bad007ccc6b71","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184235,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anil Ghosh","original_name":"Anil Ghosh","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634124d7e4b576007bfcdd1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1542871","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"bn","file_path":"/k0eOVYcY7N4kjkVkwkdtkN5PFpc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
