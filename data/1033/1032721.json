Why move to a country that could be flooded at any moment?  For the last 25 years, the political climate has shifted. The public debate on migration has become harsher, more heated, and polarized. What would have been considered right-wing xenophobia back then, is now considered mainstream. Populists simplify complex realities into good and evil, victims and perpetrators: ‘us’ versus ‘them’. Their rhetoric often consists of dehumanizing words and metaphors. One of these is ‘water’.  In reality, water is not an immediate threat to the average Dutch person; but it is a huge threat to the thousands trying to reach the Netherlands. People trying to survive the Mediterranean Sea in rubber boats. Trying to survive winter on the Aegean coast in primitive tents. To them, water really is deadly.","popularity":0.9482,"poster_path":"/gck18T8Y2AUckM5rqNoh4QiEiqq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Farifteh","original_name":"Tina Farifteh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340115d2f3b17009c2f946e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Farifteh","original_name":"Tina Farifteh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340116e0859b4007ea62a03","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Farifteh","original_name":"Tina Farifteh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634011771a32480090a2c5bb","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769771,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tijmen Bergman","original_name":"Tijmen Bergman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634011891a324800796746dc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gck18T8Y2AUckM5rqNoh4QiEiqq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":155143,"name":"sea level"},{"id":158697,"name":"installation"},{"id":244417,"name":"art installation"},{"id":271507,"name":"rising sea levels"},{"id":271672,"name":"water"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Royal Academy of Arts Graduation Festival 2021","release_date":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
