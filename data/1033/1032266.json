By Swiss composer Arthur Honegger, Jeanne d'Arc au Bûcher (1938) is an imposing oratorio. The libretto is a highly original creation by French poet and playwright Paul Claudel, who dramatises the last moments of the martyr's life. Originally written for actress Ida Rubinstein, the oratorio is written as a flashback in which Joan recalls her life, just before she dies. Honegger creates visually evocative ambiances and fills the orchestra with new sounds (saxophones, ondes Martenot). The initial prologue to the piece was added in 1944 as a symbol of the resistance during the Nazi occupation of France: again, Joan goes beyond her own story.","popularity":0.5826,"poster_path":"/oB51AEfHunwg8tWG1pPP5RHSZaG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medici.tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joan of Arc at the Stake","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Joan of Arc at the Stake","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Cotillard","original_name":"Marion Cotillard","popularity":3.6316,"profile_path":"/biitzOF0GffIqFYLyOPkoiaOngQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jeanne d'Arc","credit_id":"633e50eac4ad59007ac511c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Gallais","original_name":"Xavier Gallais","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/wgP5f298Ezi5yNanRLCCO6PAYTi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frère Dominique","credit_id":"633e5102e93e95007c4f26db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yann Beuron","original_name":"Yann Beuron","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jlkEZTXeDCMefEFq3oF4yjwYHsm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Une Voix/Porcus/Un Héraut/Le Clerc","credit_id":"633e51174f9a99009087d5cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Almajano","original_name":"Marta Almajano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marguerite","credit_id":"634007c735a61e008191d185","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aude Extrémo","original_name":"Aude Extrémo","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/tY5OwLYDV6jEdWil1i8ZZkkUQc7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"634007dd014325007a2ee772","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Martin-Bonnet","original_name":"Eric Martin-Bonnet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Une Voix/Un Héraut/Un Paysan","credit_id":"634008001a32480090a2c2a4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Moreno-Lasalle","original_name":"Anna Moreno-Lasalle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mère aux Tonneaux","credit_id":"634008290859b4007957b1e4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pep Planas","original_name":"Pep Planas","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/eu5Px48CasZhndexz9s87FDMNWc.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"L'Appariteur/Robert de Chartres/Guillaume de Flavy/Perrot","credit_id":"6340086fe04d8a0081286645","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carles Romero Vidal","original_name":"Carles Romero Vidal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Herald, l'âne/Bedford/Jean de Luxembourg/Heurtebise/Paysan","credit_id":"634008de1a32480079674377","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3730536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Soustrot","original_name":"Marc Soustrot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hZUvsh44j1tNyBhTooK8CKbFCtc.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self -
