The echelon with paintings by Repin, Levitan, Serov, Shishkin, Rublev icons and other priceless treasures in August 1941 reached Gorky from Leningrad. There, the valuables were reloaded onto a barge, which went deep into Russia. The destinations were the city of Molotov, as Perm was then called, and the city of Solikamsk. The film tells about how they lived in the evacuation, how they worked and why after the war the participants of these events did not want to remember those difficult times.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brage Haulers on Kama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2275759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Lepikhin","original_name":"Сергей Лепихин","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zFyHkuE3qHMQQiaCcm1mPjLGBLJ.jpg","credit_id":"633f5f980859b400795778fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
