(Live in San Diego, CA)","overview":"Capturing one of the band’s first shows back on the road in Autumn 2021, this intimate performance at San Diego’s historic venue The Observatory North Park was filmed shortly before the release of Servant of the Mind. The setlist included some of the very first live performances of the hit singles “Shotgun Blues” and “Wait A Minute My Girl.” Filmed and edited by the team at Ghost Atomic Pictures (“Shotgun Blues,” “Die To Live (feat. Neil Fallon),” “Leviathan,” Let’s Boogie: Live from Telia Parken), you can feel the excitement of both the band and the crowd as they both return to live music after such an extended period away.","popularity":0.1344,"poster_path":"/lJmgT3NPaebGpZUU5ly8NUmnYZN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VOLBEAT - Wait A Minute… Let’s Tour!
