Just love each other with the highest power of pure feelings. This movie started many years ago. When we began to shoot it we could hardly imagine how this drama would end. Back then, Lena, mother of three, living Russian soul, divorced the father of her kids Yura and married a murderer sentenced to life imprisonment. What was it? Now, after painful challenges, becoming husband and wife again, Lena and Yura, simple rural aristocrats of the spirit, once again amaze us with the depth of their introspection, delicacy of feelings, with humor and sadness about things that will never happen.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Movie’s Over","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Vasilyeva","original_name":"Irina Vasilyeva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340b15b706e56007ad2491c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
