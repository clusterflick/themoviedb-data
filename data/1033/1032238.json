I shot 8mm footage during the state of emergency in Japan and just after moving back to Taiwan. I then spent several months cutting and pasting each 8mm frame onto 16mm film. Sometimes the daily fragments were too sentimental, but the film gave me shelter.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2021-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flight and Frame","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3299602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Chang","original_name":"Johan Chang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6354f6f843250f007d047425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"先行一車電影放映同樂會","release_date":"2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
