The film follows the journey of Consuelo and Robert against the backdrop of the changing ecosystem in the grasslands of Isabela, where endemic grasses are being slowly displaced by invasive foreign species, and ends in the beaches of Palawan once inhabited by mythological crabs. As a poetic and lyrical rumination on the beauty of words, this docu shows how language is indeed the soul of a culture.","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":"/i21m19CM1Lf2Am51R5zI266fqUj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57619,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Commission for Culture and the Arts","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hulagway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1129370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Prado","original_name":"Sue Prado","popularity":0.4527,"profile_path":"/sbU1OXO7mKIHG6QSz7XvRxc2pLH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Consuelo","credit_id":"6306433fcee2f6007e2fbd54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalil Almonte","original_name":"Kalil Almonte","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"63064351aaf897007f24db44","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038736,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alvin B.
