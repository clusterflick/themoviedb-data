A suicidal young man mourns the death of his stepmother who had come into fatal contact with an apple. A bubbly radio DJ catches her fiancé in an unexpected sexual encounter on the eve of their wedding night. A dapper restaurant owner falls for his doppelganger. A bookshop clerk resorts to black magic to get the attention of a girl with a fetish for cookbooks.  Lips to Lips is Malaysian filmmaker Amir Muhammad’s directorial debut. It is Malaysia’s first independent digital feature film that marked the beginning of the Malaysian independent film movement. It paved the way for the Malaysian New Wave’s unique brand of DV (digital video) cinema, whose leading figures have developed a niche of dedicated film audiences.","popularity":0.1454,"poster_path":"/yWQSpQFOt1qycBh7zRNMo4WsF1V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2000-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lips to Lips","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Lee","original_name":"James Lee","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/wJk5IChXodofMry0u3QqghLfafn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"James","credit_id":"6307a49465c26c007aaacb1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3676539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anitha Abdul Hamid","original_name":"Anitha Abdul Hamid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Anitha","credit_id":"6307a4a8bb070d007c554784","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Huzir Sulaiman","original_name":"Huzir Sulaiman","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/5g229Xowgg6OdgPJR1Pzgx6oWgb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Huzir","credit_id":"6307a4b5e18b97007bda2389","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3676541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Khong","original_name":"Daniel Khong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"6307a4c2b7d3520083aa2d0b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manesh Nesaratnam","original_name":"Manesh Nesaratnam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Manesh","credit_id":"6307a4ddbb070d008436d104","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Teoh","original_name":"Patrick Teoh","popularity":0.3998,"profile_path":"/2ztHXsn78l1LVgaWXmLgpCGh74Z.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Patrick","credit_id":"6307a4e8b04228007f4af67a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3676547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Bessey","original_name":"Joanna Bessey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Joanna","credit_id":"6307a4fd3dd12600839d7c0e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Muhammad","original_name":"Amir Muhammad","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/35MKfC9O5W1cPhRhhZ4fmOewhDv.jpg","credit_id":"6307a53448138200837f0181","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Muhammad","original_name":"Amir Muhammad","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/35MKfC9O5W1cPhRhhZ4fmOewhDv.jpg","credit_id":"6307a54385090f0082680512","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559407,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rosihan Zain","original_name":"Rosihan Zain","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/mftx3wC8aAYPlOVSc5jQyUXW2yt.jpg","credit_id":"6307a576ca7ec6007efc556c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0248963","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"lipstolipsmovie","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1845,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWQSpQFOt1qycBh7zRNMo4WsF1V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1215}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
