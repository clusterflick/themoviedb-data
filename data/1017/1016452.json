The man shares his discontent with the local government, and American politics at large. An avowed Marxist, he thinks that carrying a picture of Fidel Castro when arrested probably did not endear him to the police. He discusses his thoughts on loneliness, specifically the ways in which big cities such as Chicago and New York contribute to feelings of isolation, particularly for those who do not enjoy popular pastimes such as sports and rock music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/oaKtTZupvHGPweAirLIMBiVHD0z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roger the Dodger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Palazzolo","original_name":"Tom Palazzolo","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/kjuOKH6IUvMu8cBbOPiZTA3WIwa.jpg","credit_id":"63067d21aaf897007f24ea84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1121,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oaKtTZupvHGPweAirLIMBiVHD0z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":743}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
