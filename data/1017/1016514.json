Large sections of the two towns were destroyed and a big reconstruction effort was immediately mounted with the aid of the Danish state. Sweden lent a hand, donating a large number of prefab wooden houses. The moment was seized to lay out more practical town plans, while the reconstruction strove to preserve the style of the original houses, so as not to change the distinctive character of the two towns.","popularity":0.082,"poster_path":"/5UJCmrSB2mL0qCcsKhGL6hJ6Hro.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rebuilding of Rønne and Nexø","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annelise Reenberg","original_name":"Annelise Reenberg","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/tLHoVplqB2Fxmh0ZsI5FRi0E0qx.jpg","credit_id":"63069d9f15376c007e947f1d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","original_name":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/l4g1K4ai3HgAIg0267O5ppnknVX.jpg","credit_id":"63069d4ba27502007b2c0ddf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Poul Bang","original_name":"Poul Bang","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/4Pi9GKdwjWOChPqc9XMfuQe1Lts.jpg","credit_id":"63069d9872a2c900866c27b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0310095","wikidata_id":"Q19827674","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5UJCmrSB2mL0qCcsKhGL6hJ6Hro.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
