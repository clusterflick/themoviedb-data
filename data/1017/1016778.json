Andrews prefers socialite Roger Hastings, whom May marries but soon discovers is a drug addict. While May is recovering from a nervous breakdown precipitated by the knowledge of Roger's addiction, he slips cocaine into her medication. Soon she also is addicted, a fact which Roger delightedly reports to Andrews. Andrews then commits May to a sanitarium and Roger becomes a procurer for a gang of white slavers. When the gang abducts his sister Julia and takes her to Roger's brothel, he turns against them. Julia is released, and after many complications, Roger returns to Andrews' house and, during a struggle, sets the house on fire, killing them both.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/krHOF1P3bExf3AncVhDQinvlY1Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cocaine Traffic; Or, The Drug Terror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Kaufman","original_name":"Joseph Kaufman","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/nlxPB4QxSPh3BDmKoFzfDw9lzY6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roger Hastings","credit_id":"630789d7ca7ec6007efc4c84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"May","credit_id":"630789e6c39266007f194056","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Myers","original_name":"Harry Myers","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v2Y70uGlW7FQV8khBqRUOUEdy4n.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"630789f665c26c0082548640","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin DeWolf","original_name":"Edwin DeWolf","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"630789a5b042280082ea3513","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Myers","original_name":"Harry Myers","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v2Y70uGlW7FQV8khBqRUOUEdy4n.jpg","credit_id":"63078999c39266007f194030","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230590,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harvey Gates","original_name":"Harvey Gates","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd97117c29ae5bc3d97958","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592943,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sol Lesser","original_name":"Sol Lesser","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd97309d1f778ab8994530","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003779","wikidata_id":"Q19788172","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cel0JA0xepJiNQ4YEpV6l8MZnWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/krHOF1P3bExf3AncVhDQinvlY1Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
