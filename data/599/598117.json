Blending fiction, nonfiction, and experimental film genres, against a trans narrative employs a gender-busting combination of intimate diary footage, stylized dramatic scenes, spoken word performance, faux audition tapes, and roundtable interview footage to explore and initiate a dialogue between feminists, queers, and transfolk about the way we construct personal and historical narratives. Careful attention is paid to the ways generation, race, class, and culture impact our understandings of gender.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zmJl8pyBiD67OYeXv2CjpTt0Bkk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against a Trans Narrative","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Rosskam","original_name":"Jules Rosskam","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc4aa9c0e0a2619d6f4f0c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.592,"height":1082,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zmJl8pyBiD67OYeXv2CjpTt0Bkk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":641}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
