This Zurich Opera House production also features a mesmerizing turn by Paoletta Marrocu as the beautiful, power-hungry Lady Macbeth, while striking sets and costumes further enhance the duality of the main character whose rise and fall mirror the darkest impulses of man. Replete with supernatural mystery, sexual tension, and violent power plays, this timeless story remains gripping and chilling for today's audiences and boasts some of the most astonishing music of Verdi's legendary body of work.","popularity":0.3106,"poster_path":"/wWNECnbk55LjMucbxfmbUhFPYf2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79627,"logo_path":null,"name":"TDK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Macbeth","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":460831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hampson","original_name":"Thomas Hampson","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/6DGBYLORYO3uKvJrWUCV2rNswbh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Macbeth","credit_id":"5cc73040c3a36820b58627ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paoletta Marrocu","original_name":"Paoletta Marrocu","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/5DePq0ryxLaKkYVEsobaGGV5EEu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"5cc7305d0e0a2678a0f0490c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Scandiuzzi","original_name":"Roberto Scandiuzzi","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Banquo","credit_id":"5cc730749251415cd2fb92a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2300080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Lima","original_name":"Luis Lima","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/q3c4sbSgPcZdKJJVNVNJZq7CfMW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Macduff","credit_id":"5cc730bc0e0a265283ed16cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liuba Chuchrova","original_name":"Liuba Chuchrova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dame Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"5cc730fc9251415d3bf6ee68","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miroslav Christoff","original_name":"Miroslav Christoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Malcolm","credit_id":"5cc731129251415cd2fb9341","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Welser-Möst","original_name":"Franz Welser-Möst","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5cc731350e0a267f78ef2f77","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"64c38535af6e9400e3c6c989","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2300082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Pountney","original_name":"David Pountney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cKXLBIhjdIVMlzY65f3UZ77gsjo.jpg","credit_id":"5cc735f3c3a3684936840e36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5cc731780e0a265283ed17c4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddc322f4f58010012f735ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWNECnbk55LjMucbxfmbUhFPYf2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZG7kf5ZE3ZikCT7mNdS3hEIunX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1441}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
