Wonderland Break Myself!","overview":"The second big TJP show of the year was quite a fun one. The first two matches were alright with the UU Girls getting another win in their match. Things started to get interesting with Maki vs Riho which got really intense despite the low workrate, ***1/4. Shoko and Yuka actually had a pretty good match against the necro girls, Maho and Su Yung, ***1/2. Jun vs Misao was not my type of match, but it was still quite the spectacle. Surprisingly enough the tag titles changed hands with a weird finish, ***. Main event was pretty fun with Rika showing she can hang withh a top star like Miyu","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":14662,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TJP Yes!
