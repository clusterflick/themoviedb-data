Inspired by practices more or less close to magic, she tries to create two characters that will be part of herself. She will be able to live without being alone, while fleeing the external reality. But little by little, the two beings that she created appear to be detached from her, as if the figure three could not agree to the harmony of the group. Her fantasies seem to turn against her, increasing her sense of isolation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5P65mXgdvL4aTtl23LXP3iIql2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stagnation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Peppermint","original_name":"Carole Peppermint","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd845b84f94001249c077","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Peppermint","original_name":"Sylvie Peppermint","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd855a294f0001034a230","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Gonod","original_name":"Gerard Gonod","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd866caab6d19c59ac778","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Conversin","original_name":"Michel Conversin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd884b84f947f3b48e320","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Pouyet","original_name":"Laurence Pouyet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd89bcaab6d4c34979474","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Royer","original_name":"François Royer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd8bfb84f94001449c041","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Marie Arrignon","original_name":"Anne Marie Arrignon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd8d9a294f0001234d468","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yann Tromelin","original_name":"Yann Tromelin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd906a294f0001234d501","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annick Valet","original_name":"Annick Valet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd915caab6d1e819ae389","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Letourneux","original_name":"Philippe Letourneux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5d2bd92ab84f947f3b48e537","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Mazars","original_name":"Alain Mazars","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/AgTVBzaBxnGftRGw9lFGVsmUnrJ.jpg","credit_id":"5cc8a033c3a36847dd81e4b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Mazars","original_name":"Alain Mazars","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/AgTVBzaBxnGftRGw9lFGVsmUnrJ.jpg","credit_id":"5d2bd938caab6d1e819ae3d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5P65mXgdvL4aTtl23LXP3iIql2F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Festival International du Jeune Cinéma de Hyères","release_date":"1977-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
