Presented by acclaimed children's author and academic Katherine Rundell, this intriguing tale is set behind the scenes in the golden age of Shakespeare and sheds a shocking light on the lives of children long before they were thought to have rights.  Thirteen-year-old Thomas Clifton was walking to school on 13 December 1600, when he was violently kidnapped. And what's most extraordinary is that the men who took him claimed that they had legal authority to do so from Queen Elizabeth I herself. Children are so often missing from history, but this tale has survived by the skin of its teeth. This inventive film pieces together Thomas Clifton's story from contemporary accounts, court documents, plays and poetry, with the missing gaps beautifully illustrated by vivid hand-drawn animation.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/7OcQPB1dCOr67G59yMKbFFwVn33.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abducted - Elizabeth I's Child Actors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2624395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Rundell","original_name":"Katherine Rundell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"60d6a1958805510074c6c64e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susie Attwood","original_name":"Susie Attwood","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d6a17c6c0b36002ebe8313","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8884328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7OcQPB1dCOr67G59yMKbFFwVn33.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
