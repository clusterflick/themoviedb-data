It's acted by the singers of the Decca recording of the opera (with two substitutions of actors standing in for singers) and the lip-synching is generally unobtrusive. The musical performance is superb, conducted by Riccardo Chailly with admirable fire, and sung by some of the leading lights of the opera stages of the 1980s. Shirley Verrett virtually owned the role of Lady Macbeth at the time, and she delivers a terrific performance, the voice equal to the role's wide register leaps and it's suffused with emotion, whether urging her husband on to murder or maddened by guilt in the Sleepwalking Scene. Leo Nucci's resonant Macbeth may lack the ultimate in vocal color and steadiness (his last notes of the great aria Piet√†, rispetto, amore are wobbly) but he compensates with intensity in both singing and acting.","popularity":0.2101,"poster_path":"/AiqFv5zA4rvgCqWxsj2sE1JIbr4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi Macbeth Chailly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Nucci","original_name":"Leo Nucci","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/fre6T3D9ba2DwpOz3mxnetRr8JW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Macbeth","credit_id":"5cc750cdc3a3683ad5841f31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Verrett","original_name":"Shirley Verrett","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/lysNHncqS4LVQbmbzB1jQO4cH6w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"5cc7547d92514151ca07ebd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Ramey","original_name":"Samuel Ramey","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/mqxTOwlKY7tOTBUvNsrBWKZtHsJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Banquo","credit_id":"5cc75a3b92514120dbf64c59","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1006157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Caterina Antonacci","original_name":"Anna Caterina Antonacci","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/7ZuOkR7zaLDSOKpZaxXBziTsK54.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dama de Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"5cc75a5f9251410961f619d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veriano Luchetti","original_name":"Veriano Luchetti","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/fEQloLk420vFRtljr2uZbKXCAKC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Macduff","credit_id":"5cc75a820e0a267f78ef7d40","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Barasorda","original_name":"Antonio Barasorda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Malcolm","credit_id":"5cc75aa592514119e5f618fc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Fontana","original_name":"Sergio Fontana","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mendico","credit_id":"5cc75ac90e0a264eefeeadaa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Sansier","original_name":"Nicolas Sansier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Fleanzio","credit_id":"5cc75ae70e0a2633d0efb1a2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Chailly","original_name":"Riccardo Chailly","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/lIA0VTcCG1wgGAKwVbPi3t9TYOc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5cc75b07c3a3682820842e99","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc75c149251415d3ef70fea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204811,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry Lange","original_name":"Henry Lange","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc75c4dc3a3683ad5843cf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5cc75c660e0a264ef4ef61c7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude d'Anna","original_name":"Claude d'Anna","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/1ZTZbGTsVguCXjmkAcsWMPtHuEA.jpg","credit_id":"5f7f2f76b7abb500366b70e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AiqFv5zA4rvgCqWxsj2sE1JIbr4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":933}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
