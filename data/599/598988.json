Once a rarity and now a harvested agricultural product, demand for this Chinese delicacy attracts entrepreneurs to Southeast Asia, where the swiftlets make their edible homes. Howard Gan is one of these investors: a recently retired Chinese-Malaysian Canadian immigrant who spent over half his life in Montreal. Gan decides to return to extended family and oversee his investment. The swiftlet's idiosyncratic life cycle—building homes for their offspring, only to be displaced and forced to resettle—captures the imagination of Gan's artist daughter, who sees the parallels to her father's own life. Addressing themes of home and heritage, Cavebirds is a beautifully crafted father-daughter story that explores the changing values between generations and our desire to know where we come from.","popularity":0.064,"poster_path":"/qqFXp1Vvmxlqqifv1vo66L5tyOb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cavebirds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Gan","original_name":"Emily Gan","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc935a5c3a368742580b325","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301468,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Olsen","original_name":"Christian Olsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc935edc3a368744380aeab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Gan","original_name":"Emily Gan","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc935c60e0a266f04ec1fe0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Gan","original_name":"Emily Gan","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc9354b9251412ba100f35c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301469,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thomas Kimmerlin","original_name":"Thomas Kimmerlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc93606c3a36820b58965cf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Gan","original_name":"Emily Gan","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc935b69251417ea6f28aba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lkhwLtpNWOtqpMBvTcUCtYXq11y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2025,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qqFXp1Vvmxlqqifv1vo66L5tyOb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1361}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hot Docs 2019, Toronto","release_date":"2019-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2019 Trailers: CAVEBIRDS","key":"hy7FJIT9KJ0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-19T14:03:42.000Z","id":"5cc93531c3a3682dad84fe56"}]}}}
