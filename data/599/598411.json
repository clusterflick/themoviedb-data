The work investigates the possibilities and limits of writing a history of the Lebanese wars (1975-1991). All parts are short fake documentaries, hysterical symptoms of sorts that present imaginary events conctructed out of innocent and everyday material. The tapes document fantastic situations that beset a number of individuals during the civil wars. The tapes do not document what happened, but what can be imagined, what can be said, what can be taken for granted, what can appear as rational, sayable, and thinkable about the wars.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8tzfHxmQAZbAee3VTGCderIZ0aK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dead Weight of a Quarrel Hangs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walid Raad","original_name":"Walid Raad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc65c7d92514120dbf4c711","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8tzfHxmQAZbAee3VTGCderIZ0aK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
