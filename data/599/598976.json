The main catalyst (Chocolat) is a young American performer torn between nurturing her love relationship in the USA, while maintaining a booming entertainment career in Europe. The plot evolves into a documentary medium, when Chocolat uses a small video camera as a tool to explore and question her life through interviewing others. Her questions include, why are her friends abroad? And do they intend to return to their native countries? We discover some of the common elements that drew them from their homes: economics, political climates, sexual freedom, and much more. The camera captures amazing performance art lifestyles in the backdrop of all interviews.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/ncQVwW4KfZ6Sfkbrm92OZnEgETI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maybe Dreams Can Come True","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Electra Weston","original_name":"Electra Weston","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc90ab59251415d3bf9de6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4163298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncQVwW4KfZ6Sfkbrm92OZnEgETI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
