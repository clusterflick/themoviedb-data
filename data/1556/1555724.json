Filmed between 1970 and 1976, it records everyday life, landscapes, and wildlife of the Pantanal wetlands, highlighting both the beauty of the region and the pressures facing its environment. Combining observational footage with an ecological perspective, Mundo à Parte extends Sucksdorff’s work in På jordens baksida (1972), continuing his exploration of Brazil’s natural world and the communities who live within it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6mxWWR4rFhLCzSrOkrQ8q3hjNbU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":276036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto Nacional de Cinema (INC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One of the great contemporary documentarians.
