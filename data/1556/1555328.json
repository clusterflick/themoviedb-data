Their quiet domestic life is punctuated by political commentary and the sounds of piano and flute. As Landsbergis revisits his most important documents and works before his fragile memory fades, Oškinis’s camera captures a story about the bond forming between generations, and about a spirited, creative mind residing in a body increasingly resistant to it. Their artistic collaboration culminates in a joint appearance on the contemporary opera stage in the film’s finale.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandfather","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas Oškinis","original_name":"Vytautas Oškinis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dd222a1da2a01b69b9b1bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vytautas Landsbergis","original_name":"Vytautas Landsbergis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1Bor2m9Eqz9p6f3Zor5t6Ezuopq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dd2234fa62eb1bc0b423cd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas Oškinis","original_name":"Vytautas Oškinis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dd223fd3e94966c02dfb79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38573751","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
