The place begins to gather young people with artistic ambitions, becoming the center of their lives. It quickly gains a reputation as a unique spot on the artistic map of the entire country. That is until it has to be closed... Then the regulars of \"Eufemia\" begin to collide with the reality that exists outside this safe haven. Through depicting two parallel time frames, the film shows the protagonists both during their time spent in Eufemia and several years later - in completely different places, with different dreams, and under entirely different life circumstances.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eufemia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35380153","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
