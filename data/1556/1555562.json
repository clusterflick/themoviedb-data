Threads become the organs of a whirling, burping, guzzling machine animated by hands, looms, vats, cogs, and feet. Where does the machine end and the body begin? The weaving cooperative promises equitable remuneration for workers in an industry beholden to its colonial predecessor: today, Burkinabè cotton farmers live in permanent debt to cotton companies financed by European capital. By focusing on the repetitive labor unfolding within a cooperative that claims to serve its workers, Everything Here Holds Its Inverse examines the tension between empowerment and evolving oppressions. Can the ties that bind and define also set free?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Here Holds Its Inverse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5723229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oscar d'Angeac","original_name":"Oscar d'Angeac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dd82ac69c34fc64fe1dc2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190477,"name":"cotton"},{"id":214409,"name":"weaving"},{"id":237116,"name":"burkina faso"},{"id":239547,"name":"cooperative"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival International du Film black de Montréal","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything Here Holds Its Inverse_Trailer","key":"962410488","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-19T16:27:40.000Z","id":"68dd82a0bd66200ffd38d518"}]}}}
