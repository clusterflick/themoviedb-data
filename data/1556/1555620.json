This film explores the different mechanisms humans use to cope with death: trauma, guilt, shame, and grief. This work advocates for the study of individual processes, unique experiences that should not be ignored. How can one adapt to an irrational reality, full of nonsense, rewards for deaths, finger-pointing, and violence? Eighteen-year-old Fitz and his 12-year-old sister Lur must face this question.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/uOeM0YOZS70gZ0V2z2TlVhR9t8v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In
