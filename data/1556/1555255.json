Its theatre saw the first public concert of the young composer and pianist. On the centennial of the event in 1946, a two-day Piano Festival was organized in Duszniki, which spawned a cyclic cultural event — the local Chopin Festival. It is the oldest music festival in Poland. Tadeusz Makarczyński's film shows beautiful landscapes of the Duszniki environs and the still extant Zdrojowy Theater. The musical background is Chopin's pieces, performed by the festival's participants: Zofia Rabcewiczowa and Henryk Sztompka.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recital Chopinowski w Dusznikach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
