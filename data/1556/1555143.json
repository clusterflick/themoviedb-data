From his modest workshop,\r where wood and wire are transformed through patience and\r passion, Ghaly gives new life to an instrument that once\r carried the songs and struggles of generations. Through\r sincere, intimate moments, the film captures his resistance\r against time and cultural neglect, portraying a story not just\r of an instrument, but of survival through craftsmanship and\r living memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“In a world that forgets, one man remembers.
