His task was to rescue a kidnapped young woman. But the higher he climbs, the darker the journey becomes, culminating in a harrowing confrontation with a supernatural specter guarding secrets no man was meant to uncover.  Meanwhile, Officer Negrete navigates the urban labyrinth of a crime-ridden city. His mission is just as perilous as tracking down a phantom assassin known only as Hit, a killer whose name inspires fear even among the underworld. As Negrete dives deeper, he uncovers a tangled conspiracy where every clue brings him closer to death.  Though separated by distance, both men’s paths are bound by destiny. As the mountains tremble with ancient horrors and the city burns with bloodshed, Juan and Negrete must rely on their courage and each other’s strength to survive missions that could change the course of their world forever.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ley Federal 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
