It highlights widespread newspaper and literature circulation, extensive day-care centers and libraries, and open palaces for art appreciation. Realist painting is contrasted with American press and tabloid literature, using jazzy music. Polish publications focus on peace and prosperity, while workers engage in cultural creation through theaters and community groups. The film uses strong contrasts and voiceover, ignoring cultural policy failures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Culture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805145,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Halina Kubik","original_name":"Halina Kubik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dd192dc99913e8d0bb1bf0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
