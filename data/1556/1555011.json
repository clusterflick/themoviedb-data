At its center is the iconoclastic film producer Stuart Cornfeld (1952-2020) sharp-tongued, outspoken, irreverent, and true to himself. The film unfolds through the eyes of an artist who, in Stuart’s final years, paints multiple portraits while speaking with him and those who knew him best (friends, collaborators, actors, film directors and, film producers) tracing the life of a man who embraced misfits because he, too, never quite fit in.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8jrS0d0vxSMLnR85pDmAZfH3X9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In
