Part 1-3","overview":"On December 29th, 2014, the body of 17-year-old Brianna Wells was found murdered and dumped like trash in a South Phoenix alley. This raw and unflinching film directed by Dan Brown Jr follows Gina, a determined advocate turned grassroots investigator, as she seeks justice for Brianna.  Through Gina’s lens, the film uncovers failures in the PHXPD, potential media bias, and dark secrets hidden within Brianna’s adoptive home.  With emotionally charged interviews and a bold new approach to true crime storytelling, Girl Forgotten challenges public perception and exposes a chilling case that continues to demand answers.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/oHquD8gD86D1xUQjGw5VEtDsgpT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":275996,"logo_path":null,"name":"CrimeSonics Documentary Films, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl Forgotten: What Happened To Brianna Wells?
