He first tests it on dancer, Veena (Sita Devi), with great success.  One night Veena, as instructed, gives the serum to the local villagers who then began to sign over all of their property to Sharma and his co-conspirators (Dalpat and Azim).  Two villagers, who avoided taking the serum, report the incident to the King (Master Mohammad) who in turn instructs his son Vijay (John Cawas) to investigate.
