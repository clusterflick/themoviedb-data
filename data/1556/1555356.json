Over his career, he has appeared in more than 120 films not only in Eastern and Central Europe but also in Switzerland and Italy. Film sets brought him close friendships and moments of joyful creativity. Yet today, many of his colleagues are gone, and the actor is increasingly visited by the regret of unfinished work. The Old Man’s Journey is shaped not by the structure of a traditional biographical film but by the fragmentary nature of memory. The roles he has embodied remain etched in his recollection no less vividly than the key events of his life, and so the film guides the viewer between Budraitis’s youthful memories and his most significant cinematic experiences, weaving them into a single, nostalgic stream of remembrance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":122233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Jam","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Man's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juozas Budraitis","original_name":"Juozas Budraitis","popularity":0.2429,"profile_path":"/wmE1zSKYRKIc25jQHbZTxiT1Tws.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68dd2c9e9221e538142df8c9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nerijus Milerius","original_name":"Nerijus Milerius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3FVXZQa9t9kKvO8gkEJLtZ4GDX5.jpg","credit_id":"68dd2cc755b7b4061fc7778a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nerijus Milerius","original_name":"Nerijus Milerius","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3FVXZQa9t9kKvO8gkEJLtZ4GDX5.jpg","credit_id":"68dd2ccde96d9dbfb738d155","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1416757,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stasys Baltakis","original_name":"Stasys Baltakis","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dd2cd85a29835f24b9b37b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eitvydas Doškus","original_name":"Eitvydas Doškus","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/a42t2FW11Y4tRGnSr6jGDeS1Zuf.jpg","credit_id":"68dd2ce2646a7ecc3cb42515","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1536693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabrielė Urbonaitė","original_name":"Gabrielė Urbonaitė","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/miJO467d9bCwmkR7Mtcnu1UGs2t.jpg","credit_id":"68dd2ceb34d53513a138cd89","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julius Grigelionis","original_name":"Julius Grigelionis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/dCN2EnvC5WSQaT6pkI8VoDbtgJa.jpg","credit_id":"68dd2cf4fb92749312e1d8fd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785027,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antanas Jasenka","original_name":"Antanas Jasenka","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/69T4G3PJV624YWgSBXmC8bseOqV.jpg","credit_id":"68dd2cff738307dda3b9b0a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3788119,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonas Zagorskas","original_name":"Jonas Zagorskas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dd2d0ef1d56d0f7db42667","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38573833","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
