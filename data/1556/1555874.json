The authorities launched a secret mission, sending Lieutenant Tem, a talented young officer, together with Sergeant Thon, a veteran soldier, and twenty-four patriotic troops to deliver medicine and artillery shells. Their goal was not only to supply the besieged forces but also to plant the national flag at the frontier as a symbol of sovereignty, even though they knew the mission might cost them their lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pak Thong Chai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
