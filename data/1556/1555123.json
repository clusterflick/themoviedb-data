On the edge of the great sea lanes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence lies a tiny archipelago which is gradually shrinking from the ceaseless nibbling of the tides. Here, on the Magdalen Islands, live 10 000 sturdy fisherfolk, descended from fifteen Acadian families who, two hundred years ago, fled the threat of deportation. The film portrays the frugal but independent existence of these people and their relentless struggle to wrest a livelihood from a sea which reaches almost to their doors.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wind-Swept Isles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"jean sarrazin","original_name":"jean sarrazin","popularity":0.8116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68dc7a94358e0cdcdb531594","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Palardy","original_name":"Jean Palardy","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc79778bbaf4344c38cbf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1256075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Devlin","original_name":"Bernard Devlin","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc7996e96d9dbfb738cebb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"jean sarrazin","original_name":"jean sarrazin","popularity":0.8116,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc7a0bdfa796eac8bb18e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3054109,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Roy","original_name":"Jean Roy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc7a34f8fc54ac6e531f5d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc7a45004e86a2a1e1d57c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":957757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldon Rathburn","original_name":"Eldon Rathburn","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc7a5206dc807f58e1d48d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293895,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Victor Jobin","original_name":"Victor Jobin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68dc7a60dc61a5e019e1c70e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
