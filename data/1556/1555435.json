In this surreal, slapstick whirlwind, three chaotic 'Penistone Round Table' Volunteers stumble through the absurd but heartfelt process of How to be a Filmmaker.  With tips from Keaton Talmadge, the great-granddaughter of Buster Keaton himself, “How to Be a Filmmaker” breaks the fourth wall and all the rules in a riotous crash course on creativity, all leading to the big screen at the Penistone Paramount Theatre.  Funny, fast-paced, and lovingly bonkers.
