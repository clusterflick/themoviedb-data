In 1967 it was torn apart by civil war. Between these two events Nigeria enjoyed a kind of golden age, full of cultural ferment and cross-tribal fertilization. Every kid out of the village was writing the great Nigerian novel. A spirit of great hope prevailed through the land. Give Me A Riddle is about this golden age, seen through the eyes of ex-Peace Corps volunteer returning to his host country a couple of years after his Peace Corps service as a teacher at the University of Nigeria. The film follows Roger as he looks up his old student friends, travels with them to their homes, talks with them about their lives and the life of their country. Shot in 1966, the film is a time capsule of a Nigeria and the Peace Corps both in the rambunctious bloom of youth.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/qo03KfsFxZU6dy2zNI6csdSRS06.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Me a Riddle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Eyam Nzie Okpokam","original_name":"Paul Eyam Nzie Okpokam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"669c23a1a6360f795d9bcb06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Landrum","original_name":"Roger Landrum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Roger","credit_id":"669c23be2db4303733099e67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manze Ejiogu","original_name":"Manze Ejiogu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"669c23d11f531df52f4fda1d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Ogar","original_name":"Gabriel Ogar","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"669c23d59b8e53c6a78eaee1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nzie Okpokum","original_name":"Nzie Okpokum","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"669c23dd9e335c8207099eaa","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Schickele","original_name":"David Schickele","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b4c556c19ea00ca46e652","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4469560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1649,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qo03KfsFxZU6dy2zNI6csdSRS06.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1161}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
