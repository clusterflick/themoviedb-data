It is a short film about the human being. Time, death, you, me, laughing, crying, loving, dying surround the plot. There are endless questions. Who am I? What am I doing here? What is my place in this world? Where does my story begin? Where does it end? The allegory of the sea, the place where life was created, is the stage for this short film. Travessia is this journey we call LIFE. Thoughts fly from one side to the other, just as the boat where the history takes place. In this calm environment, the characters play from question to question. What if by chance we're not here? And if by chance... \"I need time to understand all this.\" Time, that small space in our lives that ends in death.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":"/y5ZPBum7QvRSoDATTe2uoPj4lrZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travessia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caio Blat","original_name":"Caio Blat","popularity":0.3368,"profile_path":"/8IOGXiIkJtBQNH1hWdLnkAyMoZ4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vicente","credit_id":"650bc17b4da3d4010bb0e9a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliane Araújo","original_name":"Juliane Araújo","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/jLx0Hu9YBubq3qNe8PRSNShtHs3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"650bc1883d745400c4a13bfb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Lima","original_name":"Gabriel Lima","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650bc1e6dd83fa00c6f7c06d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliane Araújo","original_name":"Juliane Araújo","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/jLx0Hu9YBubq3qNe8PRSNShtHs3.jpg","credit_id":"650bc1f544ea54011d01b08d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27604160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y5ZPBum7QvRSoDATTe2uoPj4lrZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cine PE 2023","release_date":"2023-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
