Meanwhile, the camp Ashley and Ty work at is called Kilometer 72. They have just crossed over into a province whose energy values don't align with their own and run into protests and antipathy. A single, debt-ridden mother takes a job as a pipe labourer at a remote camp near the town of Hardwell. As tensions grow between workers and neighbouring communities, Ashley is challenged to protect the industry and her only source of income. Forming an unlikely bond with a member of her crew, Ashley and Ty help one another navigate hostile working conditions and the complexities of an industry in transition. Pipe Nation is a fictional analysis of the historical, political and economic significance of pipelines. It works to illuminate the unique relationships between individual citizens and the webs of steel which lie below.","popularity":0.1266,"poster_path":"/roxR3g2Ipr9k9QiHx09iEOfuZaU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hardwell Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pipe Nation","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nels Lennarson","original_name":"Nels Lennarson","popularity":0.459,"profile_path":"/lWsQopdsGhBoTeZphWwK9RL0Ya8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grady","credit_id":"65b5d67c1c635b014713210e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4503975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Svedberg","original_name":"Daniel Svedberg","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/gsROhqvE8OJUTHRzolVWrZYHAbT.jpg","credit_id":"65b5dcb5afe224018439d39c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4503975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Svedberg","original_name":"Daniel Svedberg","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/gsROhqvE8OJUTHRzolVWrZYHAbT.jpg","credit_id":"65b5d612f6596f0184ff635e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raoul Bhatt","original_name":"Raoul Bhatt","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b5d64f4f33ad01310c2f9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12993202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/roxR3g2Ipr9k9QiHx09iEOfuZaU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
