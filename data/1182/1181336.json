It came out late, was hardly playable on some consoles, and the designers received death threads afterwards. Now they are planning their comeback: with \"Phantom Liberty\". Once again, superstar Keanu Reeves is in the game - and Hollywood icon Idris Elba. \"Inside the Game\" follows the designers of CD Projekt Red not only at their workspace in Warsaw, but also during the first presentations of the demo version in Los Angeles and Cologne.","popularity":0.2442,"poster_path":"/2XNoqPF1ZDwNF7upRNXYxANEEo6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside
