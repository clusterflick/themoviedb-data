Amelia Hokulea Borofsky, the daughter of anthropologist Robert Borofsky who lived in Pukapuka in the mid 1970’s and Johnny Frisbie, a Cook Island legend in her own right. Her book Miss Ulysses of Puka-Puka written at age fifteen, was the first published literary work by a Pacific Islander author. Both lived on Pukapuka as children and left at different times, but they both return to reconnect – with emotion, celebration, and a sense of belonging. Filmmaker Gemma Cubero del Barrio also weaves in her own intimate story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8dXytEvrKbyW4h3w1dOXFy8EDCz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island In Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Borofsky","original_name":"Amelia Borofsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650bbd6f3d745400feecfc4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Frisbie","original_name":"Johnny Frisbie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650bbd7df9253200ea90f01f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gemma Cubero del Barrio","original_name":"Gemma Cubero del Barrio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650bbd5444ea5400c631a0dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16604752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1122,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8dXytEvrKbyW4h3w1dOXFy8EDCz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":746}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
