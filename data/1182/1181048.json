When his wife is killed before his eyes by a serial killer who has escaped from prison, whom he had brought to justice some time before, he leaves everything behind and moves to Sicily. One night, due to a strong storm, the electricity goes out. Sebastian goes into the shed to try to start the generator but, in the darkness, he trips over a cable on the ground, pulling down a metal shelf. He discovers a hidden niche in the wall containing a box with six female scalps inside.The scalps belong to a serial killer who killed in the area twenty-five years earlier, nicknamed \"the Hairdresser\" by the press. The ones found by Sebastian would be his trophies. The killer was never caught and now seems to have returned to strike.","popularity":0.6107,"poster_path":"/5cr4VWlTdMm3OPpLzN2LgOhrs3T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11228,"logo_path":"/tLdn4pStInhdPQxNyxHFuQQLT50.png","name":"RTI - Reti Televisive Italiane","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":19108,"logo_path":"/jWhpxFZd02PbcFtUSiCraifRZTC.png","name":"Latina Pictures","origin_country":"MT"},{"id":127156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leader Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Souvenirs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":570349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgia Surina","original_name":"Giorgia Surina","popularity":0.2119,"profile_path":"/qVDu9YdsdvtKEpfmdnKcNsd7kTq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Isabella Leoni","credit_id":"650abe180d5d850138e73a98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Demetri Goritsas","original_name":"Demetri Goritsas","popularity":0.2431,"profile_path":"/4c3qr0nOHzLbGv7ZQIUIMj94yWE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sebastian Brody","credit_id":"650abe3681c7be011d76dd26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabetta Pellini","original_name":"Elisabetta Pellini","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/hnSdx53jY1iliIgw7enFcLe8UI8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gloria Maugeri","credit_id":"650abe6481c7be0100529b31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Festa","original_name":"Riccardo Festa","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/4IarrEPhPgJqv4bNQb4LiFqShQW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ispettore Anzalone","credit_id":"650abe7ad6c30000cce1248f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pilar Abella","original_name":"Pilar Abella","popularity":0.2946,"profile_path":"/ewm4YTF42UJcMQPvXci8v5H6nu8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mary Brody","credit_id":"650abe8baede5900abd54f10","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1042152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Lorimer","original_name":"Paolo Lorimer","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/kKHD7k323bJGGGqooGOOhv6PY4B.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Commissario Canova","credit_id":"650abea4cadb6b011bbe4fd7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Vaporidis","original_name":"Nicolas Vaporidis","popularity":0.1766,"profile_path":"/uispqoAbHNvyzW7lKmXaksqH0aP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Domenico De Chirico","credit_id":"650abebaaede5900abd54f27","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaetano Carotenuto","original_name":"Gaetano Carotenuto","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/4z6qBJtX6YKxBF4DEfgdOJeOrVp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Roberto Polo","credit_id":"650abed26c19ea00adec8827","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clive Riche","original_name":"Clive Riche","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/f1OYzWdmOCJSSWKODuGdEOBrykp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tucker","credit_id":"650abee26c19ea014f4b786a","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edoardo Margheriti","original_name":"Edoardo Margheriti","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":"/ysYttf5NRtucvWJzP8vBDooNJRR.jpg","credit_id":"650abef10d5d850138e73b11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061052,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Hurwitz","original_name":"Brian Hurwitz","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650abf07d6c30000cce124c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3085509,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paolo Sciarretta","original_name":"Paolo Sciarretta","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650abf29cadb6b011bbe5032","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1921093","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5cr4VWlTdMm3OPpLzN2LgOhrs3T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfKYgTf3P6xelJs40akxboOFscO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
