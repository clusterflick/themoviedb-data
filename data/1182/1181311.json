Director Linda Mabalot's narration, combined with archival images, stop-motion animation, water-color paintings, and poignant interviews with Filipino American older immigrants distinguishes MANONG as a pioneering introduction to an Asian Pacific American community whose narrative mirrors other immigrant groups who arrived to fill a void in America's labor and service sectors.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manong","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Mabalot","original_name":"Linda Mabalot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b60c1b1f68d013ab4792a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
