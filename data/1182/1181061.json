The trial of the 3 Marias was the first moment of the Portuguese feminist movement with an international visibility. It stirred up the stagnant waters of dictatorship and was a deafening cry sent out to the world. What was the impact of the work they were judged for? How different are our lives today? On the 50th anniversary of the book, the documentary Novissimas Cartas Portuguesas celebrates the book, courage and women. All women.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/rMTkDCegxxofHqGS9UVgJXwUMxQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newest Portuguese Letters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23739716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/rMTkDCegxxofHqGS9UVgJXwUMxQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
