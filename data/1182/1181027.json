With weathered sculptures made of stone and cast in an extraordinary location. Temporary storage in the museum. Not public. On two days in the summer of 2005 - morning and evening - a film was made at this location. The film is shot with a minimal amount of digital technology. Jazz saxophonist Michael Schulz improvises live pieces sketched specifically for the project. The images will later be supplemented by previously unreleased mixes of some of his studio work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qDWBWYP3xHpuDTZFC5ChXZvzKpV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depot.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Schulz","original_name":"Michael Schulz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"650aaf739661fc01e8354f06","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Körner","original_name":"Andreas Körner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650aaf1a0d5d8500e0521762","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Körner","original_name":"Andreas Körner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650aaefc0d5d8500c3e9ab4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Schulz","original_name":"Michael Schulz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650aaf5e6c19ea00eba1c12d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280947,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lea Röksch","original_name":"Lea Röksch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650aaf32aede59013885ce69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4280946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Körner","original_name":"Andreas Körner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650aaf0981c7be00adfee764","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":2097,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qDWBWYP3xHpuDTZFC5ChXZvzKpV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1429}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
