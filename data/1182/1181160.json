As a child, Jan would dance and sing for anyone who would listen. As a teenager, she began writing and performing her own songs. After earning her BA in Arts and Entertainment Management, she continued making music while working full-time as a limo driver. The income from that job allowed her to hire a studio as well as a videographer to help her make her unorthodox DIY music videos and distributing them on VHS tape. Without her knowledge, her videos made their way to the nascent YouTube. The fact that her most popular YouTube video was given the title “Worst Music Video Ever” didn’t dampen her spirit. Her fanbase grew to include such luminaries as Marilyn Manson and Cynthia Plaster Caster. Over the years, Jan’s independent spirit attracted many collaborators who’ve helped bring her vision to life.","popularity":0.2802,"poster_path":"/hHjuhX6HVfU3nhY1npc7491Bn8E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rock on Jan!","title":"Jan Terri: No Rules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Terri","original_name":"Jan Terri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650b14fb81c7be010052bf8b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Hacker","original_name":"Darren Hacker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b152212c604011bf6306d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Hickler","original_name":"Fred Hickler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b154212c604011bf63080","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aeWhmljhnRRSiSvo1Suo4pUy3MK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hHjuhX6HVfU3nhY1npc7491Bn8E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":520,"name":"chicago, illinois"},{"id":10229,"name":"singer"},{"id":13126,"name":"limousine driver"},{"id":41214,"name":"youtube"},{"id":277050,"name":"bar"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"30th Annual Chicago Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jan Terri: No Rules - Documentary Trailer","key":"cjpdfmEQIag","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-31T20:46:16.000Z","id":"650b16cb12c604011bf630d2"}]}}}
