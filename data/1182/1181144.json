A growing gap between reality and perception has created viewpoints often based on emotion rather than fact. Can we conquer climate change? Human beings are facing a problem that requires a solution more complex than taking one side. Society’s use of energy is a profound story. It transcends far beyond the boundaries of one region. The conflict between our need for fuels and our need to reduce human impact is filled with strong emotions including anger, lies, greed, and divisiveness.","popularity":0.191,"poster_path":"/A08CbVM6UXRFtC8ukvXfnP3fhKB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Common Ground Film
