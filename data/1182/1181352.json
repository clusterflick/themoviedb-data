Delphis, 11 years old, grows up in a disadvantaged neighborhood and an unstable family environment. One evening, he decides to take control of his life and becomes The Hurricane. Armed with a lightning bolt on his headband and his middle finger held high, he flees a world that has no place for him. With the police and the Youth Protection Services on his trail, he leaves a mother in distress and has significant encounters in the street. Conquering himself, his adventure is like a road trip, from Hochelag' to Berri, from one family to another. Under the impetus of a hasty adolescence, his freedom thumbs his nose at the indifference towards the marginalized. Social etiquettes burst forth in an assertive tone and sustained rhythm. Between punk music and Marjo, The Hurricane hits us in the face, without waiting to die!","popularity":0.8962,"poster_path":"/faFssU8hvfuW3zlrYzg2gd6xYL1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26855,"logo_path":"/qijzRuv4faQWjWWusDmAgTJwynB.png","name":"Bunbury
