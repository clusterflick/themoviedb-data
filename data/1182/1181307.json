Armed with megaphones, costumes, musical instruments, giant dolls, stilts and banners, they set up shop in different parts of the city where they raised scaffolding on which they climbed to summon the public to witness their show of singing, music, dancing and pantomime in the who told stories that quietly delved into the events of the last years of the military dictatorship at the end of the 1980s. 25 years passed, Andrés Pérez had died and the street actors became references in theater and television, when Flores returned to the eighties images to create this tribute
