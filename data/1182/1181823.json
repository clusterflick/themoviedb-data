Through a heart-felt introspective visual poem written by Carlos Mason, the film explores the personal pursuit of fulfillment through rock climbing in the wilderness. Waking at first light after late night drives through darkness, we share beautifully sunlit mountain wanderings of psychedelic-like natural highs that are eventually grounded by climbing's sharply humbling crux of patience and perseverance. It's an inspiring cycle towards the majestic summit of reward - Sending the Project - with the embrace of friends supporting from below, and celebrating around the fire, beneath the stars in the Eastern Sierra moonlit glow.","popularity":0.0894,"poster_path":"/nPYMSQbIgnGX9x8BVkTjKTpzjdU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sending","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Pringle","original_name":"Ethan Pringle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Climber","credit_id":"650cccbf93db9200ac2b7fc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4284110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Hazlett","original_name":"Anna Hazlett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Climber","credit_id":"650cccc82c6b7b00e122b83e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4284111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Beall","original_name":"Dan Beall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Climber","credit_id":"650cccd0b5bc2100eacae26c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4284109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Mason","original_name":"Carlos Mason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650ccca144ea5400e3225925","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27260162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1105,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPYMSQbIgnGX9x8BVkTjKTpzjdU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
