Combining the reflective aesthetics of art-house cinema with the gory and primitive nature of zombie films, Among the Fallen brings about an original story of a grieving writer struggling to come to terms with his past as he battles his inner and outer demons. Gathering inspiration from such filmmakers as Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, and George Romero, the film combines a plethora of unconventional themes to create an unorthodox and surreal zombie story. One with a human soul.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/irRO4NNWhzRjCl9vxAMFl8m6jVi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
