It chronicles the heart-wrenching journey of Steven, a PTSD-afflicted veteran, as he grapples with the profound loss of his devoted service dog, Daisy. The weight of this farewell is almost unbearable. As a poignant homage, filmmaker Steven Long crafts this narrative five years after Daisy's departure, celebrating not just her unwavering bond, but also honoring the countless canines who've embraced us as kin.","popularity":0.2825,"poster_path":"/b5OAoxNWn40szt0bTP9nVtQNYgu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hobby Animations","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daisy's Final Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Long","original_name":"Steven Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Steven","credit_id":"650b7cad44ea5400ad792fa0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Long","original_name":"Amanda Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"650b7cbc3d7454013879ae35","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282199,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Josue Montaño","original_name":"Josue Montaño","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b7d05d94035013857bf88","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Long","original_name":"Amanda Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b7ea72c6b7b011bc383f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Weidmann","original_name":"Brian Weidmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b7ed74da3d4014d55777c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Long","original_name":"Steven Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b7e8e4da3d4010bb0c1fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4282197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Long","original_name":"Steven Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b7e703d7454013879ae7f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25252326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5OAoxNWn40szt0bTP9nVtQNYgu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":447,"name":"post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)"},{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":163077,"name":"military veteran"},{"id":256967,"name":"service dog"},{"id":278863,"name":"psychiatric service dog"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
