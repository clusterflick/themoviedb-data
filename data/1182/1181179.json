At the beginning, a subject is presented talking to people in the middle of the street. Next, an approach to the street artists is carried out, accompanying the images with shots of passers-by. The images and interviews of these subjects of various ages are shown, who explain the reasons for their processes and provide clues about the various types of street art that are carried out in the Center of Santiago. The edition exhibits records of artistic products and, at the same time, exhibits the conditions of precarious and daily work with which they have earned a living in a society in crisis.","popularity":0.1021,"poster_path":"/e9z4GdQRoPdC54AV81nh4QMcnSF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grupo Proceso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"1990-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Príncipes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Carlos Palacios","original_name":"Juan Carlos Palacios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1cbecadb6b00c4f77c88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3757529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Carlos Romero","original_name":"Juan Carlos Romero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1dfc501cf201001c5e15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Echeñique","original_name":"Cecilia Echeñique","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1d0112c60400c4eae02c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Carlos Palacios","original_name":"Juan Carlos Palacios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1c9f0d5d8500aa3e2255","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Echeñique","original_name":"Cecilia Echeñique","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1c72cadb6b00e11fb1e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Echeñique","original_name":"Cecilia Echeñique","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1ceab1f68d011df6dc87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4281514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Carlos Palacios","original_name":"Juan Carlos Palacios","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650b1cd3cadb6b011bbe7791","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e9z4GdQRoPdC54AV81nh4QMcnSF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1990-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
