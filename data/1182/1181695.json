Against Matisse-like colour palettes and impressionistic-resolutions, the central figure of “Glide” is a woman floating on a lantern-helmed rowboat. We float through various angles and perspectives as she’s drawn languidly towards a collective future. The screen blends between settings that emerge from sky to ocean and from canvas to characters coming together in a watery dreamscape that enacts a mysterious ritual. The soundtrack voices the oceanic and star-lit setting. Think Vangelis in an Aeolian reverie of golden hues. Think, ponder and glide.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/AeGdWtyyW41vCM6nm1Lr0b9wlws.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4283653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Zumpano","original_name":"Jason Zumpano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650c91cf93db9200e1781a3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AeGdWtyyW41vCM6nm1Lr0b9wlws.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
