Using a striking visual style, director Francois Girard ('The Red Violin' and 'Thirty-Two Short Films about Glenn Gould') places Yo-Yo Ma within a series of computer-generated, three-dimensional recreations of Piranesi's well-known prison etchings.  Through Yo-Yo Ma's and music producer Steven Epstein's struggle to recreate and interact with the imaginary space that Ma performs in, the film examines the complexity of illusion, of representation and reality.","popularity":0.5259,"poster_path":"/pEYY8GzwZbYDlvXwzf1kYaN3wKl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bach Cello Suite #2: The Sound of the Carceri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yo-Yo Ma","original_name":"Yo-Yo Ma","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/3qa5GTwmV99kZLLNvKom4CHCnyO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6245e433c7176d008d75cc7f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Girard","original_name":"François Girard","popularity":0.2121,"profile_path":"/djxaEAgKaYS2MAzQm5B5yHZeCqr.jpg","credit_id":"6245e426c740d90047b517a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yo-Yo Ma","original_name":"Yo-Yo Ma","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/3qa5GTwmV99kZLLNvKom4CHCnyO.jpg","credit_id":"6245e3fb960cde005d7c6b73","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":219052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick McKinney","original_name":"Nick McKinney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63af54f957530e00c4816b11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Niv Fichman","original_name":"Niv Fichman","popularity":0.3262,"profile_path":"/oDetf7f01a6yWVGO4JN2LM32FGV.jpg","credit_id":"63af55135ad76b007dc71639","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0128947","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pEYY8GzwZbYDlvXwzf1kYaN3wKl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8K9hDNNG0A0sX2nqsl80osEAOK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
