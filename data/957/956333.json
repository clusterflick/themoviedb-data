Adams adapted the work into a symphony, comprising its three main acts.  In the second half of the program, Adams conducts his 2015 violin concerto, Scheherazade.2, which restages the tale of the One Thousand and One Nights heroine as a strong woman navigating a patriarchial society, incarnated by the solo violin part. The work was composed specifically for Canadian-American virtuoso Leila Josefowicz and co-commissioned by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, who perform it to perfection. The evening then closes out with Tromba Lontana, an orchestral fanfare written to mark the 150th anniversary of Texas’s independence from Mexico in 1836.","popularity":1.0404,"poster_path":"/3hbVfPRa5cKrlPOlJQBc0dC2eRx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":172547,"logo_path":"/tGJKp0pH40cbTd3eOewgQHlAKEX.png","name":"Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (RCO)","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Adams conducts John Adams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3486567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leila Josefowicz","original_name":"Leila Josefowicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n786zxkOzro1Ker109zyfExVM5p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Solo violin","credit_id":"62449981cee481005da84d54","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2486880,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dick Kuijs","original_name":"Dick Kuijs","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/gHCsMBODsCLIZyAl2vNlHJmzbmH.jpg","credit_id":"6244994cd7f465008989a0a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Adams","original_name":"John Adams","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/jWSg6LhA7ZLv15ipUgVlOH0wh94.jpg","credit_id":"6244995e960cde0049ffd775","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Adams","original_name":"John Adams","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/jWSg6LhA7ZLv15ipUgVlOH0wh94.jpg","credit_id":"62449967c50ad2005ce08bac","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1570,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Mku7RZClwKfhUJ6ZN7djathn4P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2791}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2525,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3hbVfPRa5cKrlPOlJQBc0dC2eRx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1785}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":192471,"name":"orchestra conductor"},{"id":225846,"name":"minimalism"},{"id":243710,"name":"contemporary classical music"},{"id":254831,"name":"symphony orchestra"},{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"medici.tv","release_date":"2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
