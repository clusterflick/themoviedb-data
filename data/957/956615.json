Germany, 19th century, Middle Rhein Valley. The dreamy Idilia awakes injured in the midst of a gloomy castle ruin and can't remember anything that happened before. When she discovers in horror that there is no escaping the towering castle walls, she begins a grueling fight for survival. Only her nebulous diary can help her decipher the past, which exposes a secret romance with Abyssinian actor Caven, a performer in a human zoo exhibition run by her fiancee Franz Hagerberg. Idilia's written record, however, blurs the lines between reality and fiction.","popularity":0.2692,"poster_path":"/pVl7aoZqiaUztUD9RUsa8LgSDQp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151769,"logo_path":"/9OHctABolsmNKAZ1nV5ctqi3sPc.png","name":"Sternenberg Films","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":220267,"logo_path":"/hWPoa09LiejRJK8n5Ke2mWYDh7y.png","name":"Ciara Filmproduction","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":65795,"logo_path":"/s58sKD2AywXI69x0QpqbVWKhCen.png","name":"FunDeMental Studios","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":220269,"logo_path":"/na4twKUdCFOXdqu4HZHoW2Mo8GT.png","name":"Spektrumfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":220270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brandstorm Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4 Days to Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea van Acken","original_name":"Lea van Acken","popularity":0.2843,"profile_path":"/zZiteVW8rbhOBFT6XwrdhmVtAKX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Idilia Dubb","credit_id":"65c38aeb2b8a43012e39d067","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Kabongo","original_name":"Eric Kabongo","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/xEdcEPpitwrlrlKUvBqZPMzWGYH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Caven","credit_id":"65c38af12476f20149fe3bfc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Hennicke","original_name":"André Hennicke","popularity":0.5376,"profile_path":"/ooLG1YJU6hsc5KNGeHqTkwv0GMe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Franz Hagerberg","credit_id":"65c38af93fe7970162fe5fe8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsten Strauch","original_name":"Carsten Strauch","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/uszBPsXTSi3Ocn3hjv5mUcfVO8U.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Assistent Wagner","credit_id":"65c38aff95acf000ca1b81ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1787119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reiner Wagner","original_name":"Reiner Wagner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"65c38b18c15f890163f53cbf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Rupp","original_name":"Dieter Rupp","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Assistent Rupp","credit_id":"65c38b202476f20149fe3c0e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4523210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deryl Kenfack","original_name":"Deryl Kenfack","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/bHocQqcl92QTW1Ped2AbqZewP4s.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Djimon","credit_id":"65c38b278c0a48016485a388","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4523211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut Rieker","original_name":"Helmut Rieker","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Fotograf","credit_id":"65c38b2d2fe2fa01842a7650","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Konstantin Korenchuk","original_name":"Konstantin Korenchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62453e0d0f365500967073cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Korenchuk","original_name":"Konstantin Korenchuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62453e09f48b34005b5a0495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Pilarski","original_name":"Simon Pilarski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62453e1bc740d9005d83b9b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Pilarski","original_name":"Simon Pilarski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62453e14af43240047bf0d48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12794540","wikidata_id":"Q117861568","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1MySuIkX9lJ7qoh2FM8YkNuBDkN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1409,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pVl7aoZqiaUztUD9RUsa8LgSDQp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"4 Tage bis zur Ewigkeit -
