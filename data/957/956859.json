Using Douglass's own powerful, profound speeches and writing, the story retraces his journey from a man born and raised in slavery to one of the most prominent elder statesmen and inspiring voices for freedom in American history. With additional context and insight provided by historians, scholars and Douglass's descendants, the filmmakers recount the brutality and trauma of his childhood while illuminating his strength of character, defiance against the bonds of slavery and the influences that guided his lifelong quest for freedom. The most celebrated Black man of his era, Douglass's legacy and achievements continue to resonate today. His life and work still inspires activists, educators and citizens in the fight for freedom, equality and a more just American society.","popularity":1.094,"poster_path":"/zMqCNqymDRyx1yRAhDlU7CHNI00.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming Frederick Douglass","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendell Pierce","original_name":"Wendell Pierce","popularity":1.3959,"profile_path":"/uOsldo9Pkl0E79UbIXX5tZZmC8F.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Frederick Douglass (voice)","credit_id":"63e81aad63aad200bd92016f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth B.
