Director Reed Harkness captures the story of his half-brother, Sam, who grappled with the disappearance of his mother during the most formative years of his life. After setting out to find her as a teenager, Sam works through the subconscious trauma caused by her absence, his family members' denial and his feelings toward his mother, whose new life proves better than raising kids. Sam's journey is an emotional roller coaster with loops of mental health, commitment issues and familial relationships.","popularity":0.5333,"poster_path":"/ugUcUKyf8tRla5Z0tLa6HdARJr7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186405,"logo_path":null,"name":"2R Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":90691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centripetal Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":186406,"logo_path":null,"name":"HA/HA","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":183975,"logo_path":null,"name":"ITVS International","origin_country":"US"},{"id":90689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucid Visual Media","origin_country":""},{"id":14088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roped In Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A missing mom.
