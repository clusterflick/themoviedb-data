A Kurdish immigrant to Sweden who was murdered by her father in 2002, Fadime has become an international symbol of the debate over cultural traditions that accept the use of violence to control women's behaviour. In Crimes Without Honour, four extraordinary activists risk everything to publicly challenge these traditions and tell their own stories of physical and emotional violence. While they practice different faiths, hail from different parts of the world and have immigrated to different countries, all make it crystal clear that the justification for these crimes is an entrenched family power structure of male supremacyâ€”one that crosses borders, cultures and religions. Raymonde Provencher has crafted a vital addition to a growing body of films about crimes related to patriarchal traditions of family honour.","popularity":0.4341,"poster_path":"/1liqPwjYFYiD2s2WOxe6vmcro2z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crimes Without Honour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymonde Provencher","original_name":"Raymonde Provencher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6245c796f48b34005b5afad6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1liqPwjYFYiD2s2WOxe6vmcro2z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1192,"name":"sweden"},{"id":191365,"name":"honor killing"},{"id":337699,"name":"family honor"},{"id":337709,"name":"kurdish immigrant"},{"id":337710,"name":"cultural traditions"},{"id":337711,"name":"male supremacy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
