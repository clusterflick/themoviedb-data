On this cinematic journey, there are no interviews or extensive explanations of the conflict between the opposing sides. Accompanied by an evocative soundscape, the film moves like a ghostly presence through a troubled region, pausing at heavily armed checkpoints and competing front lines. As the camera captures people scurrying past the aftermath of conflict, carrying plastic bags bulging with items gleaned from abandoned homes, we see the stark reality of a people caught in a borderland between East and West. Director Louie Palu's expressive, sparse and poetically delivered voiceover adds context to places the nightly news cameras don't take us, including an old coal mine and a family's home. Through its mood and atmosphere, Zero Position offers us an experiential look at a region on the brink of all-out war.","popularity":0.098,"poster_path":"/AkvF6fKeOFDYH0gFeYXmWLkra2X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Position","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2979503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louie Palu","original_name":"Louie Palu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6245033d6dc50700931b44b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2979584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Murray Brewster","original_name":"Murray Brewster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62450349223a8b004aec4c6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AkvF6fKeOFDYH0gFeYXmWLkra2X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
