How do you heal a divided and angry people? In their 2017 production of Mozart’s La clemenza di Tito, Peter Sellars and Teodor Currentzis examine these questions through the story of a warrior-emperor who brings peace to his divided land and pardons his own would-be assassins. Written under a time crunch (legend has it that it was written in only 18 days, although it is likely an exaggeration) during the last year of Mozart’s life, the opera is based on a libretto written more than half a century earlier by Pietro Metastasio. It was commissioned for the coronation of Leopold II as King of Bohemia, and received its first public performance at the Estates Theatre in Prague on September 6, 1791.","popularity":0.3709,"poster_path":"/avupeftNutgtQL6zd0Two8qoxHJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: La clemenza di Tito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Thomas","original_name":"Russell Thomas","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/7KMCzgoTR2ZbsqbWUvwxtThklA1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tito Vespasiano","credit_id":"62448e744581990047a9c1c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2137963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Golda Schultz","original_name":"Golda Schultz","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Vitellia","credit_id":"62448e7ec740d9005d80f756","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Gansch","original_name":"Christina Gansch","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/6oE8GIjV9LXM1rmSFtKD20xWPBP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Servilia","credit_id":"62448e90cee481005da82438","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2137958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Crebassa","original_name":"Marianne Crebassa","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jSqKynr9ewO13Xuos9XpsyzHTJz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sesto","credit_id":"62448e9c223a8b009428553b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3486514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanine De Bique","original_name":"Jeanine De Bique","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/tvJ9h7vFeZpP3eoOtt3xn3yXz56.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Annio","credit_id":"62448eabc50ad200470138c0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willard White","original_name":"Willard White","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/bsq1Sw3uJJUmKXa34LEtLi0kEIC.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Publio","credit_id":"62448ebb9451e7008c9ccef6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sellars","original_name":"Peter Sellars","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/jnpWmiRJ8AvGlVq87liEiuQbgvo.jpg","credit_id":"62448e14c50ad2005ce0588e","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","credit_id":"62448e1e9451e7008c9cccbc","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422901,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"George Tsypin","original_name":"George Tsypin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62448e2ef263ba005c236587","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3486505,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Robby Duiveman","original_name":"Robby Duiveman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62448e3a6dc507005de4f54d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422904,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"James F.
