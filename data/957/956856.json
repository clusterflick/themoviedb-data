Parts of her story are well known; born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including family and friends, using the network of anti-slavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. But the film delves deeper, illuminating her spirit and strength through exploits as a union scout and spy during the Civil War, an activist for women's suffrage and a singular figure who defied categorization at every turn. The foremost chronicler of the Black experience working in nonfiction film today, Stanley Nelson, alongside co-director Nicole London, brings rich, deeply researched historical detail to the story of this remarkable woman.","popularity":0.3626,"poster_path":"/wWirQ83qC846enCKmI5U1pnqtOm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harriet Tubman: Visions of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Nelson","original_name":"Stanley Nelson","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/lRYyHCFY0U2RlMVJ7OpPYmkHMvA.jpg","credit_id":"6245cbd39451e7005e8014d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1641029,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole London","original_name":"Nicole London","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6245cbdc5a9915005d62e64d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21392514","wikidata_id":"Q116760119","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJUqmujG7Vh5H1iQALz3Ve1F3F3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wWirQ83qC846enCKmI5U1pnqtOm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/qcDgdbK8mHrHsdCkkMP2YrFfxcL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2022-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Harriet Tubman: Visions of Freedom | First Look | PBS","key":"ILK3RyMlbZw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-09-12T16:00:08.000Z","id":"63391885ab1bc70097f3a366"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Harriet Tubman: Visions of Freedom | Inside Look | October 4th On PBS","key":"yIY_7UXhyP0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-31T18:44:37.000Z","id":"633918a2e194b0007a018ac2"}]}}}
