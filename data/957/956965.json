She shares her drug history as an alphabet of drug friends and poetic titles to rewrite the redemption storyâ€”she wasn't \"bad\" in active addiction and she's not \"good\" now sober. Midwaste redirects the conversation to how drug policies and racism embedded in pharmacological treatment and biomedical addiction models really make us sick.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midwaste","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Roberts","original_name":"Liz Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624605ad2cefc2009d614ec8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
