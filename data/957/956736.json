Hoping that the exhibition will deepen her understanding of him as a person and as an artist—and that it will serve as the catalyst that reignites the connection between them—she endeavours to capture it all on film. As she unearths a lifetime of her feelings of neglect through unguarded conversations with other members of her family, she begins to understand just how much his absence has eroded her sense of self. And though her father's love eludes her, she remains masterfully determined to make meaning out of the void.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":"/1oBNjbvfDUyqgv2pC4Zte2MLCgx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"בת האמן","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarita Linton","original_name":"Margarita Linton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6245987d7caa47008ad74d78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2187208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaniv Linton","original_name":"Yaniv Linton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624598857caa47005c2d3cba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":953119,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Haim Mecklberg","original_name":"Haim Mecklberg","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d1676ede1b0007ed56e2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Estee Yacov-Mecklberg","original_name":"Estee Yacov-Mecklberg","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d167e63536a0077b7b49f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tomer Mecklberg","original_name":"Tomer Mecklberg","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d16882dda89007f981711","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3190515,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yigal Mograbi","original_name":"Yigal Mograbi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d1693724de10083a21662","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarita Linton","original_name":"Margarita Linton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d169ccaa5080091fbf01d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394329,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neta Dvorkis","original_name":"Neta Dvorkis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d16a3724de1007e6735f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2187208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaniv Linton","original_name":"Yaniv Linton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d16b06d9fe8007d2d0972","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadav Hollander","original_name":"Nadav Hollander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d16b90398ab007a2a5dfc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3681598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Emeth","original_name":"Michael Emeth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630d16c46d9fe8007a7e9b70","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1185,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8sYJAdsOFLIiqVyfvwL0VHN5lyn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":790},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/1oBNjbvfDUyqgv2pC4Zte2MLCgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
