Three bandmates, Álfrún, Saga and Hrefna, of The Post Performance Blues Band, are tired of playing to audiences of five at their gigs and getting paid in beer. Each of them is staring down 40 and exhausting themselves juggling motherhood and their artistic pursuits. They decide to give themselves one year to either become popstars or quit the band for good. What follows is a make-it-or-break-it story of a band that's not really a band, pursuing a goal that is not actually attainable. Band member and filmmaker Álfrún Örnólfsdóttir puts herself, along with age and gender bias, on stage in this docu-parable about talented but not teenaged women trying to be successful in a youth-obsessed, overnight-success industry. Band allows gifted artists to perform the resilience and sisterhood that truly exists between life's messes, rejections and triumphs.","popularity":0.1945,"poster_path":"/pfhZmNseXeMTytzSOIpmR3ydC6c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38468,"logo_path":"/3PQ5z20TfOXzea2HL3TiTJkQDxK.png","name":"Icelandic Film
