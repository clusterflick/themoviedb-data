It's a job that has serious physical and psychological risks. In an effort to share their stories, the Globe and Mail has brought together several of the world's most renowned war photographers, including four-time Pulitzer Prize winner Carol Guzy and renowned Reuters photojournalist Goran Toma≈°evic. One by one, they tell of the moments that have shaped their work. But what happens when they leave their jobs to return home? With confronting honesty, the photographers describe their struggles to disengage from an all-consuming profession. Full of haunting and sometimes disturbing images, Shooting War pays homage to the people who sustain themselves through traumatic experiences to provide us with deeper insights into the agonies of the human race.","popularity":0.0521,"poster_path":"/6emDFSnB0nTqpeUvkW1qWsqm7kN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooting War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3486911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Dell","original_name":"Patrick Dell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6245059f7caa4700476c5464","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6emDFSnB0nTqpeUvkW1qWsqm7kN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
