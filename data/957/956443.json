Their deaths inspire the biggest protests in Slovakia since the fall of communism. The story takes an unexpected turn when a source leaks the secret murder case file to the murdered journalist’s colleagues. It includes the computers and encrypted communications of the assassination’s alleged mastermind, a businessman closely connected to the country’s ruling party. Trawling these encrypted messages, journalists discover that their country has been captured by corrupt oligarchs, judges and law enforcement officials. A reckoning awaits.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/6BaFzcdBEY2bdaBJWfHlDi07S2C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":182517,"logo_path":"/jayDNNc3q36yjTNgo7P4wWC2N3I.png","name":"OCCRP","origin_country":"US"},{"id":116619,"logo_path":"/w1TyJSUL3S91C9pCdrx248Ba6O1.png","name":"Frame Films","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":10946,"logo_path":"/gk4SFkJ3G49gGL308zymD8QGNw.png","name":"WDR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":110625,"logo_path":"/ubQUfq0o8qO6rkMLRFY7FZCZNLq.png","name":"Gotfat Productions","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"An attack on a journalist, is an attack on us all!\"","title":"The Killing of a Journalist","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Mordet på journalisten","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Enquête sur un double assassinat -
