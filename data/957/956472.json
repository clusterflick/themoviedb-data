Fifty years after the fact and with the help of meticulous miniatures, he reconstructs the bizarre events of one fateful winter night in 1968. What exactly precipitated the shocking discovery of Grandpa Bernie, dead in his own bed? The labyrinthian task of answering this question leads Bernie to interview a range of characters, including forensic experts and family members. Along the way, Bernie entertains increasingly absurd scenariosâ€”including the possible involvement of Agent Orange. His obsessive musings, just like the constantly changing miniature sets, never get old. Ultimately the film provides a quirky yet thoughtful look at family ties, the fault lines of memory and intergenerational trauma.","popularity":0.1548,"poster_path":"/8k6ZEzxc8JW4E87D4lMRr6GpxnF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernie Langille Wants to Know What Happened to Bernie Langille","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jackie Torrens","original_name":"Jackie Torrens","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/3BooDHmwQO4Uh1mv4wl42gmdiLn.jpg","credit_id":"6244f39d960cde0049011876","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":973273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Brown","original_name":"Jessica Brown","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e210163536a008273ca1c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teresa MacInnes","original_name":"Teresa MacInnes","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/7IPcQyiOQTaOPDH0NgSFVxaEYQl.jpg","credit_id":"630e210acaa5080091fc404e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jackie Torrens","original_name":"Jackie Torrens","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/3BooDHmwQO4Uh1mv4wl42gmdiLn.jpg","credit_id":"630e21135ab81a007a85db2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472186,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sarah Byrne","original_name":"Sarah Byrne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e211d63536a007d47c1f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176963,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin A.
