With the recent surge of women in politics, director Chloe Sosa-Sims's timely feature debut focuses on three political stars in three countries. For Jess Phillips of the UK, Pramila Jayapal of the US and Canada's Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner, politics is a deep and committed passion. Positioned on different points along the political spectrum, they take on their jobs in government with bold determination, advocating for their individual agendas. Phillips is focused on combating domestic violence, while Jayapal has set her sights on a new bill to expand American health care and Rempel Garner is looking for ways to create jobs for oil workers in her home province of Alberta. With elections looming in all three countries, the women are working hard on reforming patriarchal political institutions from the inside, and despite their differences they each fight to rise to the occasion.","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/mKEv9TGSllW3u3zZSHTZmyHDCRP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting in Packs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chloe Sosa-Sims","original_name":"Chloe Sosa-Sims","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6245b94fdfe31d004762ad56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22802408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mKEv9TGSllW3u3zZSHTZmyHDCRP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2eyKhZrYGyklvqHGdLo46DwIV8W.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Festival for Women's Rights","release_date":"2023-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
