Kunuk was the video's director and producer; Norman Cohn cameraman; Paul Apak Angilirq editor; and elder Pauloosie Qulitalik as narrator. By 1990, the four partners had formed Igloolik Isuma Productions Inc. to produce independent video art from an Inuit point of view. The video also features footage shot by Zacharias Kunuk, Paul Apak Angilirq and Simon Quassa, along with narration from three other well-respected Igloolik elders.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Inuk Point of View","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zacharias Kunuk","original_name":"Zacharias Kunuk","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":"/pnVX4dX4TJMY9QTEuD8xuxbrvAg.jpg","credit_id":"6245caccdfe31d005bd1c7b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
