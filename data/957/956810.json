Together their fathers were held in a small cell within Villa Grimaldi, one of the most notorious torture centres of that era. During their imprisonment, their fathers forged an unbreakable friendship, but only one of them, Paulina's father, survived to return to his family. Now, 45 years later, the filmmakers and their families reconstruct the last days before their fathers were taken and what lay in store for them while in captivity. With actors re-enacting these experiences on set, this film within a film unfolds and generations of the two families witness the past play out before their eyes. Filmed as Chile rises once more with a strong social movement against a repressive state, Meeting Point shows grandparents and parents passing down valuable lessons of freedom and equality.","popularity":0.25,"poster_path":"/cH8meI6MxyqRF3xD8ZIQepJu4dw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102767,"logo_path":"/fO1hw5rO5l9hFv9qj4YEeUYj90I.png","name":"La
