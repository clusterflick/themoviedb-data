This pseudo-documentary features a Canadian filmmaker who is looking into the group of dissidents. He interviews them to get the story of what happened recorded for posterity. Among the group was another man of Spanish ancestry who suddenly arrived on the island but managed to find a way out. His future exploits are brought into question since there are certain terrorist connotations to his character.","popularity":0.1428,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":156492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forum Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Royal Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Château","original_name":"Agnès Château","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gunda","credit_id":"57d3a50e92514160ab001d7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":263072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Sauvegrain","original_name":"Didier Sauvegrain","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/nNa7bKmzeYfDsF2zwPcIo1UsvdZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Toni","credit_id":"57d3a519c3a3685572001fbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Sánchez-Ortiz","original_name":"Emilio Sánchez-Ortiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ignacio","credit_id":"57d3a52a9251416099001d21","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Curto","original_name":"Francesco Curto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pedro","credit_id":"57d3a536c3a368557a001b7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Albert","original_name":"Yves Albert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"57d3a54a92514160a7001f6c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Madinier","original_name":"Bruno Madinier","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/wex0OKTRbFgl2InCmqTiTbedZsQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Michel","credit_id":"57d3a55292514160a2001e03","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Auer","original_name":"Gabriel Auer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d3a47cc3a368557a001b57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Andreu","original_name":"Carlos Andreu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67071dd57fa51d8a0e3e64e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Auer","original_name":"Gabriel Auer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67071ddd7fa51d8a0e3e64eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989778,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Andreu","original_name":"Carlos Andreu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67071dea8f4260f3b2fe9c50","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Alazraki","original_name":"Robert Alazraki","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/1oaFxGw0QSVUILrIaNShLOKT58O.jpg","credit_id":"67071df58f4260f3b2fe9c66","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35394,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joëlle Hache","original_name":"Joëlle Hache","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67071e0113981d0eb01fb8bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145440,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Liebling","original_name":"Jonathan Liebling","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67071e0c7fa51d8a0e3e64fd","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206386","wikidata_id":"Q22000658","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto International Film Festival","release_date":"1980-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"1980-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
