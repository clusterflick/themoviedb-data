It traces the individual experience, showing the emptiness one can feel as well as the discovery of a sense of meaning in life. It is a very personal and courageous film that doesn’t search for scientific explanations but instead uses documentary and fictional material to weave an intimate biography. This combination of perception and memory suggests a deep reconciliation and allows tender feelings of a mother’s love to emerge.","popularity":0.1241,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking Like My Mother","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1553536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Diggelmann","original_name":"Heidi Diggelmann","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/cbrX8bvr4dsKKRgdf1M8OgAst8O.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Old Mother","credit_id":"57d2ed809251410d22001478","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilaria Flego","original_name":"Ilaria Flego","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Child","credit_id":"57d2ed979251410d19001466","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Svercel","original_name":"Miro Svercel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Father","credit_id":"57d2eda3c3a368429100162a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Vonlanthen","original_name":"Yvonne Vonlanthen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Young Mother","credit_id":"57d2edb89251410d1b0013f1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Margot","original_name":"Dominique Margot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d2ee849251410d1e00158f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67018,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Bräker","original_name":"Peter Bräker","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d2ee20c3a3684281001754","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cornelia Seitler","original_name":"Cornelia Seitler","popularity":0.0372,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d2ede79251410d1b001420","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49440,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brigitte Hofer","original_name":"Brigitte Hofer","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d2edd99251410d100013fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Margot","original_name":"Dominique Margot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d2ee459251410d1300158d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5733260","wikidata_id":"Q26908753","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
