All the forces from assorted powers and races across the land of Yggdra have rallied behind his cause, but at the critical moment in what should be the final battle, Yuri and his allies are defeated by the Black King, the magical Chain Chronicle which records the history of the land is torn in half, and their sprite companion Pirika, who is the embodiment of the world's will, vanishes. After being forced to retreat, the Volunteer Army is left to pick up the pieces, and the alliance disintegrates. But even as the world seems to be succumbing to the dark influence of the Black King, a new hope emerges in the form of Aram, a young man with an unusual magical ability that could end up being the key to turning things around.
