In his place, he convinces Friedel, a pretty music student, to travel to Venice to meet the famous tenor. In her travels, Friedel sends postcards written by Adler to his wife to prevent her from knowing his real whereabouts. When Friedel meets Volpi’s attorney, she mistakes him for the singer, and they spend days together in a romantic, picturesque Italy without him revealing his true identity. After his release from prison, Adler realizes two things: firstly, Friedel has been negotiating with the wrong man, and secondly, his wife has discovered the trick with the postcards, traveled to Italy, and started a storm of her own. But when the storm has cleared and the confusions are clarified, nothing holds them back from a happy ending.","popularity":0.1828,"poster_path":"/uQppbe9BRgVvevnV2EcbiUhJxL6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kiba Kinobetriebsanstalt","origin_country":""},{"id":81221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Europa-Filmverleih AG","origin_country":""},{"id":81222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slavia-film","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1933-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Lied der Sonne","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Märchen von Venedig","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacomo Lauri Volpi","original_name":"Giacomo Lauri Volpi","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Giacomo Volpi - Tenor","credit_id":"57d3e40fc3a36855680031b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio De Sica","original_name":"Vittorio De Sica","popularity":0.618,"profile_path":"/SObzAVAFAzCSM5nmpvpNdX7oxq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Giuseppe Paladino","credit_id":"57d3e41f92514160a2003310","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1814145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Dietz","original_name":"Liliane Dietz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Friedel Brandt - Gesangsstudentin","credit_id":"65e3081d2ac4990186ede661","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erhard Siedel","original_name":"Erhard Siedel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65e30986498ef90131ec737b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Witt","original_name":"Vera Witt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65e30992278d8a0185be597a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud Wolle","original_name":"Gertrud Wolle","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/J5qeSqn6SH8dD3XMRpHlJXngES.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65e309a5c99826017b613adf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Sabo","original_name":"Oscar Sabo","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/AgrUzyzXmCA8b4albtaShdEltDE.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65e309b99979d2017cb01442","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hans Fritz Köllner","original_name":"Hans Fritz Köllner","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d3e3e1c3a36855720035b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2996,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Becce","original_name":"Giuseppe Becce","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d3e5fcc3a368556f003488","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovacchino Forzano","original_name":"Giovacchino Forzano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57d3e3ed92514160ab0031e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Neufeld","original_name":"Max Neufeld","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":"/wufLoROapJZi1WBWkRhMG4gr7kT.jpg","credit_id":"57d3e3d492514160ab0031d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0253214","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":820,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lkgGpBKW82fQiqpbMMlR9sRrIAF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1457}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/uQppbe9BRgVvevnV2EcbiUhJxL6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1485,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/n9lRyicDZf3esLnpkLORWjPEdW3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":990},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1099,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/65Q5PVwrSpK1vd6q85dmP0PztaV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":731}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
