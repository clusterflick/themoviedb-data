Each have their own quirkiness: Kasino the grumpy, Dono the senile, Indro the stutterer, and Mat Solar, deaf in one ear. They work in a hotel run by Paulus. Their quirkiness is the source of humour and misunderstandings, an old tried-and-tested recipe that is still used to attract movie-goers. The highlight is the hotel’s new year event. They appear as performers and call themselves, Wow, It’s Huge. They sing covers of The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and some folk songs. In the end, the show is still a mess.","popularity":0.2356,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12787,"logo_path":"/rvcHf2GqfeXMBBclvUsqdnSwAzE.png","name":"Parkit Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1982-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dongkrak Antik","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dono","original_name":"Dono","popularity":0.2725,"profile_path":"/w7R57iro3x5vmpoicGHg6YWqHj0.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Dono","credit_id":"57d4388392514160ab005862","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasino","original_name":"Kasino","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/lH02y0baaQkXOkERVrqd2W7dbTQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kasino","credit_id":"57d4388a92514160a4005785","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indro","original_name":"Indro","popularity":0.1773,"profile_path":"/54LwiUhsGogWfIGINeLr4eGjSPk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Indro","credit_id":"57d43894c3a3685568005849","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meriam Bellina","original_name":"Meriam Bellina","popularity":0.4261,"profile_path":"/ae502KLtDHdDBK7HwfYmbu0e6Ev.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anunnya","credit_id":"57d438ab92514160a2005c95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Burnama","original_name":"Piet Burnama","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/yAjp49DHUuRxsLkkF5qtstjoTkP.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Paulus","credit_id":"5b4ed0b6c3a3683052009541","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1259311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mat Solar","original_name":"Mat Solar","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/ktMMuapE0LKaHT8veupeNPHHyHA.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mat Solar","credit_id":"5d64a69bad50f0324244fd2c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack John","original_name":"Jack John","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Drunken Man","credit_id":"5dc7f08cab1bc7001304d26f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arizal","original_name":"Arizal","popularity":0.2138,"profile_path":"/arNowVrFfR6GOR7ke1HfZs4GMk6.jpg","credit_id":"57d4390fc3a368556d0061b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raam Punjabi","original_name":"Raam Punjabi","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/B4k9sBt56Gjj94bkoFB2Rm81O.jpg","credit_id":"5b4ed04c92514138de00819f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075855,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harry Susanto","original_name":"Harry Susanto","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4ed0670e0a264b7b00836f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raam Punjabi","original_name":"Raam Punjabi","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/B4k9sBt56Gjj94bkoFB2Rm81O.jpg","credit_id":"5b4ed0450e0a264b8a00862d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592752,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deddy Armand","original_name":"Deddy Armand","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4ed03dc3a368305a007014","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592729,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dhamoo Punjabi","original_name":"Dhamoo Punjabi","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/10OBvGClqezdv1A90Z5t1ebmTaG.jpg","credit_id":"5b4ed05a0e0a264b7d008827","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041654,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gatot Sudarto","original_name":"Gatot Sudarto","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/8E6JO6F9rgkC14IwcGJTwR5Zqo9.jpg","credit_id":"5b54dd2cc3a3685c8b004cc3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1152760","wikidata_id":"Q12481886","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":249860,"name":"warkop dki"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"1982-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
