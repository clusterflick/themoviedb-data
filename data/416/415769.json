It's not the most obvious choice for a way of life, acknowledges the woman in question: \"I tell you, it's like living in a madhouse.\" This cheerful menagerie Santa Claus has created keeps her fully occupied. The animals need to be fed, brushed, kept amused and taken out for exercise in groups.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"33 Animals of Santa Claus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
