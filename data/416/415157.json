But who would have thought that this newfound invention would lead to so much turmoil (they're French, aren't they?)?!  Through a mix-up, Lilli Dupont gets the job.  But Lilli is no waitress, but rather a talented singer, waiting in vain for an engagement.  She takes the job and soon every male visitor is laying at her feet.  So that Lilli doesn't constantly have to fight off all the horny men, the cashier Aristide spreads the rumor that Lilli is actually the daughter of the millionaire van Muhlen, to whom the \"Oyster King\" belongs  (daughter of a millionaire?!?  Oh yes, of course:  that will dissuade potential suitors!).","popularity":0.1313,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Austernlilli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":591515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gusti Wolf","original_name":"Gusti Wolf","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/1zrtPDE5B9Yajn2fmn0RVaCLRgu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lilli Dupont, eine Austernöffnerin","credit_id":"57d3ebb9c3a368557a003144","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Thimig","original_name":"Hermann Thimig","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/ii8yy725yPpPYcCuCVfouhioDSD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"De Austernkönig van Mühlen","credit_id":"57d3ebc892514160a2003671","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Lingen","original_name":"Theo Lingen","popularity":0.2556,"profile_path":"/98blRESQptTEdEGho7J65WeuPGd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lucien Mercour, ein Revue-Autor","credit_id":"57d3ebd692514174d8000bf8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stöckl - Filialgeschäftsführer","credit_id":"57d3ebe5c3a368557500396a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Paulsen","original_name":"Harald Paulsen","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/m7JkKrut1Z1VnZTcuuJQcf6a1rI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Aristide - Kassierer","credit_id":"57d3ebf892514160a7003926","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1542132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Meinhard","original_name":"Edith Meinhard","popularity":0.1761,"profile_path":"/hI3AFopNO1mHffeM5ZXEkkCsRPd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Susanne - Revuegirl","credit_id":"57d3eca792514174d8000c51","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Florath","original_name":"Albert Florath","popularity":0.2963,"profile_path":"/ciYf1a97dXw3J3RnTpH0nPajPYk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Marcel","credit_id":"5b10593ac3a368621800ece8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarete Kupfer","original_name":"Margarete Kupfer","popularity":0.1816,"profile_path":"/wIILmuYE6nScZclk9XfJmPCG1Ej.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Frau Brocard","credit_id":"5b10594bc3a368623000f2e4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Reithofer","original_name":"Josef Reithofer","popularity":0.3219,"profile_path":"/8jArQYqjpT8MwWH7FwxjZj85gd5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Hondekotter","credit_id":"5b1059650e0a26308900a96a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Salfner","original_name":"Heinz Salfner","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Piet van Mühlens","credit_id":"5c65def1c3a36847bbd9036a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"E.W.
