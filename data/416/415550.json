Lead by charismatic (but talentless) singer Bea Minicello, their group “Bea Minicello &amp; The Bea Flats\" immediately make Stef feel at home.\r But this Glee Club holds dark secrets and Stef can already sense tensions beneath the surface. There’s confrontational self-proclaimed ‘cool-guy’ Ash Green who has it in for just about everyone, down-trodden stage technician Dru Lowley who has a few killer secrets to share, backing vocalist Summer who behind her sickly smile is desperate to take Bea’s crown and of course Bea Minicello - who is as sweet as pie to Stef but if she’s for real then how come everyone else seems to loathe her? Something is not right...\r A story about a group of young people with their whole lives ahead of them. However long that may be.","popularity":0.1145,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just dying to be in the spotlight.","title":"All Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":964823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jemma McKenzie-Brown","original_name":"Jemma McKenzie-Brown","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/wFyc2GIiuXUC6PyMjI4azN1zQZZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bea Minicello","credit_id":"5808bf78c3a36874ca0085c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Abingdon","original_name":"Stefan Abingdon","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/nw5P5qW0ypWG44rg1y26GgK73VB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stef Harris","credit_id":"5808c053c3a3687332007d0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Horne","original_name":"Ashley Horne","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/yTdNH3uZAsoISJmbY9uqtCLrvPa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ash Green","credit_id":"5808c0699251410f570086ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dru Wakely","original_name":"Dru Wakely","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/eo8v71lRUiht9sLpuorOgYW1Wop.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dru Lowley","credit_id":"5808c0859251415dfb00d3c7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178228,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ciaran O'Brien","original_name":"Ciaran O'Brien","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5808bef79251410d8e0088bb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Holt","original_name":"Matt Holt","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5808beca92514105ea008d1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
