The only person aware of this is Serena, an eccentric fifty-year-old chambermaid who still has a smile on her face despite a difficult life. As she cleans, Serena asks the room about the fate of her deceased husband in the afterlife and the room appears, somewhat confusedly, to answer her. A surreal dialogue ensues, during which Serena talks about her own and other peopleâ€™s sins, and frankly tackles a fundamental theme of Christian morality.","popularity":0.099,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stanza 52","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72767,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurizio Braucci","original_name":"Maurizio Braucci","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/aMzbb1OeeGgWzRAOthNtFi63xwU.jpg","credit_id":"57d3e846925141609e00350b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
