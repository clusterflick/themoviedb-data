Ricocheting between genres—news reportage, documentary film, video games, and internet dance videos—Factory of the Sun uses the motifs of light and acceleration to explore what possibilities are still available for collective resistance when surveillance has become a mundane part of an increasingly virtual world. Factory of the Sun tells the surreal story of workers whose forced moves in a motion capture studio are turned into artificial sunshine.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/7RgrrXLQqJYCx2HnUwGPNwqoSzp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Factory of the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hito Steyerl","original_name":"Hito Steyerl","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dL8oPhT9JdVYfPqvGUK8CrODNgY.jpg","credit_id":"57d4a81a92514136fa001cf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2972008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harry Sanderson","original_name":"Harry Sanderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6625480f2dda890187e25a19","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2972007,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Maximilian Schmoetzer","original_name":"Maximilian Schmoetzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66254800cb5c8e01643f8e55","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmYGtvoiJ7cwuaiz9jVNDxhwMW9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7RgrrXLQqJYCx2HnUwGPNwqoSzp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Biennale di Venezia","release_date":"2015-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles","release_date":"2016-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
