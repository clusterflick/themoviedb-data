Critics, for their part, have often had problems with Tosca’s rather grungy subject matter, the directness and intensity of its score, and the crowd-pleasing dramatic opportunities it provides for its lead roles. But these same aspects have also made Tosca one of a handful of iconic works that seem to represent opera in the public imagination.","popularity":0.2347,"poster_path":"/hHzxeVUZSxdKwn6WXIxVPfo5t8F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79627,"logo_path":null,"name":"TDK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera
