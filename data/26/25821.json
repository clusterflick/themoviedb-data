Through a dramatic and vibrant combination of verite documentation, student video diaries and rare in-studio scenes of artists recording tracks, \"Follow My Voice\" offers a powerful and poignant look at this unlikely intersection of youth, gender and rock. Includes studio sessions from Yoko Ono, Rufus Wainwright, The Bens, The Breeders, Yo La Tengo, John Cameron Mitchell, They Might Be Giants and more.","popularity":0.2025,"poster_path":"/nXwnDc3dXdUlRuZRwbXZ157Ocvp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Follow My Voice: With the Music of Hedwig","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ヴォイス・オブ・ヘドウィグ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":586998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Brownstein","original_name":"Carrie Brownstein","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/3sjiZL9K8TwbL6BO5rWVhkeafbx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586bf492514135b051e287","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corin Tucker","original_name":"Corin Tucker","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/5bwdtjM5qlnzEKISksDkSLOkrHw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586c060e0a2601d6d49f62","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2234639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Weiss","original_name":"Janet Weiss","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/tjbenNSgxfk96YzVECCwn5Ju0sP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c586c180e0a26031bcb1713","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Linton","original_name":"Katherine Linton","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a923020c3a368252901784b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0800034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nXwnDc3dXdUlRuZRwbXZ157Ocvp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gyHs5rlKTRO31uyeaaXXoSm2q52.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":780,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/RbW7d9MUqZKaaI1bC5IY0cMKL2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
