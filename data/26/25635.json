Among the 104 hours selected as the basis for this film, are 30 hours of archives recently discovered in Kinshasa and never before released. Completing these exceptional documents, are more than 50 hours of interviews with those close to the former president and the events surrounding his reign, conducted by the director in Kinshasa, Brussels, Paris and Washington.  Like a vast historical puzzle, this film pieces together the tragic history of a country, and its self-styled leader - the dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, \"King of Zaïre\".","popularity":0.5974,"poster_path":"/9oJ5kl8we7cLO08vrm6Hmx5IT3D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11932,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la Communauté Française de Belgique","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":74735,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBA","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":82782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Passerelle","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":94280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image Création","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mobutu, King of Zaire","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Mobutu, King of Zaïre","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Joseph Desire Mobutu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mobutu Sese Seko","original_name":"Mobutu Sese Seko","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"56f76a05925141560a0050ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Michel","original_name":"Thierry Michel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f769bc9251411a61003803","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Michel","original_name":"Thierry Michel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f769cac3a3686a610054f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596912,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lye Mudaba","original_name":"Lye Mudaba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f769e0c3a3686a610054fd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206944","wikidata_id":"Q3317703","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":783,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9oJ5kl8we7cLO08vrm6Hmx5IT3D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":8909,"name":"zaire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
