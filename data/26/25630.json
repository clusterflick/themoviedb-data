The conversations heard in the film have never before been made public, and they reveal a highly personal portrait of an artist much discussed but not particularly well understood.","popularity":0.6704,"poster_path":"/9BSHkt8VU2V22lCIewCqn4gJQVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonfire Films of
