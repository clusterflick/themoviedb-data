The film traces a trajectory – from inside to outside, from shadow to light, from Vassiliu to Pierre, from the intimate to the public, from the past to the present. The film sounds like a song – one of which we remember the tune, sing a few couplets of and listen to the chorus with pleasure. Each outing is full of surprises and wonderful encounters. Meetings of emerging songs. A staging in small touches – like a chorus. At home, Pierre gets dressed, gets ready, gets dressed, puts on his stage shirt. Once outside, Pierre crisscrosses Sète. A port city where the incentive to travel is almost permanent. Pierre touches the people he meets with humor. The succession of these encounters places the film in the present.","popularity":0.0521,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2566,"logo_path":"/c0TDqY4835B9I80Fc9kU8365sm.png","name":"Mille et une productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qui c'est celui-là ?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70819,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Vassiliu","original_name":"Pierre Vassiliu","popularity":0.0796,"profile_path":"/1YX6I1NGdnCFsA6CNkCzhtk91dp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lui-même","credit_id":"649054f042bf01011e74bbbd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Kirsch","original_name":"Laurence Kirsch","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/iMAZJcoCPlAEcHlQKW0LVK8Fl2a.jpg","credit_id":"649054bf263462014e5926dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Cibot","original_name":"Valérie Cibot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/A61Gp7QEjiJ5qO6MOa7uyuoJHD5.jpg","credit_id":"649054cf26346200ae1cf855","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Kirsch","original_name":"Laurence Kirsch","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/iMAZJcoCPlAEcHlQKW0LVK8Fl2a.jpg","credit_id":"649054de42bf01011e74bbb0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
