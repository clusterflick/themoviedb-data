As a result of a failed experiment by scientists, the experimental virus they invented ended up in the drinking water, turning the townspeople into a horde of decaying undead, ready to devour anything in their path. Nagievsk was placed under quarantine and erased from all existing maps. Officially, such a town no longer exists. And it is precisely there that a young man named Max is heading from the nearby town of Porechensk. He must find the vaccine, which, they say, is hidden somewhere in the infected and erased settlement from life.","popularity":0.1111,"poster_path":"/iVpco31MMYy3lEgQEKaqntej1SS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green
