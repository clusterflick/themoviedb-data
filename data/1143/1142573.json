The driving force behind Rebel Queers is Angelika Ustymenko, a non-binary and neurodivergent artist and filmmaker. When their country and community came under attack, they resolved to document the experiences of queer Ukrainians during wartime. On the first anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Angelika began a new phase of their documentary project, collaborating with Huck Docs to collect queer soldiers' reflections after a year of war and broadening the focus to include other forms of queer resistance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dehvM37tK53iyC6eCCPT1zTAdu0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rebel Queers: Ukraine's Queer Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3251990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelika Ustymenko","original_name":"Angelika Ustymenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tkaPKBq1ZNgEYaj0yebTVQRTaaF.jpg","credit_id":"6491b70c2f8d090100ac13bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4121554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex King","original_name":"Alex King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6491b72dc2ff3d011cbb4381","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28131865","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dehvM37tK53iyC6eCCPT1zTAdu0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sunny Bunny LGBTQIA+ Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
