Many individuals then had to live, often in silence, with the long-lasting impact of this controversial official policy. Nine of those raised this way were invited to a workshop retreat, under professional guidance, to discuss their experiences. Each take turns delving into their past, revealing the confusion and trauma of dealing with such change at a young age. For many, this marks the first time they have had the opportunity to connect with people who have shared a similar childhood. White Nanny Black Child presents a personal, moving and sometimes unsettling meditation on identity, belonging and the nature of family.","popularity":0.1718,"poster_path":"/zHtzouX2rOcSbVK5lxTHUjtJCSq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78496,"logo_path":"/e8JC6pK5BRyFhCLmIq0F9rcSqGZ.png","name":"Tigerlily Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A group of adults find solace in sharing their experiences of growing up as children of Black Nigerian immigrants who were fostered by white British families.","title":"White Nanny Black Child","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4004841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Mundy-Castle","original_name":"Andy Mundy-Castle","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6491984a2f8d090100ac0808","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4114895,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natasha Dack","original_name":"Natasha Dack","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6491990dc2ff3d00ffbd500c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4004841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Mundy-Castle","original_name":"Andy Mundy-Castle","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6491992d263462012d4bd314","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29666745","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tlsMVsa5APfcOCkzOG05SK95K1Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gmOBuTguBTzUgNvG6KIaaXWXFbe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2221,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zHtzouX2rOcSbVK5lxTHUjtJCSq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"White Nanny, Black Child wins the BAFTA for Specialist Factual | BAFTA TV Awards","key":"GGc7m7h18L4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2024-05-12T21:43:40.000Z","id":"6644b7d380647071d65bdd89"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"rDiilPLxs6k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-28T10:02:20.000Z","id":"6644b800fbddf970f1ee9f08"}]}}}
