Raised on the tough streets of Philadelphia, Dave Culmer is drawn to the Marines, enchanted by the impeccable attire and imposing stature of a local Marine. After being dismissed from high school, he finds his path leading him not to the widely known Parris Island boot camp, but to the lesser-known Montford Point. His path to becoming a Marine is fraught with discrimination and grueling trials that push him to his physical and mental limits. Amid the struggle, he learns resilience, embodying the relentless spirit of Montford Point that drove these men to exceed expectations set by a society that predicted their failure.","popularity":0.2383,"poster_path":"/16k3YA1BVWTvlAHSljUZqOrS54I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Against systemic racism, a Montford Point Marine shatters expectations, excelling in sports and leaving a lasting impact on the Marine Corps and Veteran's Administration despite significant adversity.","title":"The Jock: A Montford Point Marine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4122780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Culmer","original_name":"Dave Culmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Dave Culmer","credit_id":"6492576665e0a200ad1f7eef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
