When the count sees the family’s beautiful daughter Annette, he immediately suggests that they can stay if Annette comes to the estate as a housemaid. Plainly seeing the count’s disgraceful plans for what they are, the father, Antonio, resolutely rejects the offer. To raise money, Annette, her brother and a friend travel instead to Paris where Annette meets and falls in love with the count’s son Henry. When Annette’s father sets out to Paris to fetch the children home to his sick wife, he is horrified at the sight of his daughter’s newfound wealth. Has she sold herself for mere money?
