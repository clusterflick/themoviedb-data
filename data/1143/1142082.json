It is the great ark that, according to Genesis in the Bible, was built by Noah according to God's instructions. Noah was given the task of saving himself, his family and all the animals of the earth from a worldwide flood, the so-called deluge. The story appears in the Abrahamic religions; Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Linder's work here asks the existential questions that follow the story of Noah; who should be saved and who should be left behind? Who will make the selection? In the film, the character Hannah Arendt has begun to suspect that the boat Noa is building will not be able to accommodate everyone. Arendt, the Wolf and the Sheep gather and confront Noah, who refers to God's instructions. The worry is spreading.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything on earth will perish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4119581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Linder","original_name":"Eva Linder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649001d6263462010cbcc4a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
