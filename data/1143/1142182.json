She meets Marcel (25), a confused and depressed  young man who is her opposite and has no interest in what life has to offer. Leni's mother Magda (35) juggles jobs to afford  everything Leni needs.

And, above all, they resign, accept their destiny and the fact that they are characters in someone else's story.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/qODq04AhuXT0ogWH0TGBntkmSkD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Cat Film","origin_country":""},{"id":157827,"logo_path":"/lf6crBOcMKMskOPu7H5L5IGHRFg.png","name":"Atelier de Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":157830,"logo_path":"/f2lSAmhtAgcrBExmyuMWB6vPpo5.png","name":"Avanpost","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2024-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Elephants Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4120126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carina Lăpuşneanu","original_name":"Carina Lăpuşneanu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Leni","credit_id":"64906a9542bf0100c7fcac1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2505967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Cora Mihalache","original_name":"Alice Cora Mihalache","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/l1vbKU5cauhwRue2Y1mwgyBNoiO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Magda","credit_id":"64906aa1c3c891010ca623a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Mihai","original_name":"Stefan Mihai","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marcel","credit_id":"64906aae42bf0100e49fe298","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bovnoczki","original_name":"Richard Bovnoczki","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":"/CU8YobMwxFE9LNZ0mdowRFXGEe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64906acb2f8d09011d254ec9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1025963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iulia Verdes","original_name":"Iulia Verdes","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":"/hTnr8XPw1iTvQwOCowY3OSk4nWC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64906adc26346200eb776193","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4120128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Hîncu","original_name":"Andrei Hîncu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64906ae12f8d09013afb31d2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1623007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabi Virginia Șarga","original_name":"Gabi Virginia Șarga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/phlFifIqPTbB5FaAdTriomRGStn.jpg","credit_id":"64906a322f8d0900ad360425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cătălin Rotaru","original_name":"Cătălin Rotaru","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/s67o1JW2UFHE91YWvs3hjijA5ic.jpg","credit_id":"64906a3f42bf0100e49fe270","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3116088,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Pădurețu","original_name":"Adrian Pădurețu","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1UOGFj9KLGx0DPmsmPyXWiuVjYB.jpg","credit_id":"64906ac0559d2200ff1217f4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1623007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabi Virginia Șarga","original_name":"Gabi Virginia Șarga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/phlFifIqPTbB5FaAdTriomRGStn.jpg","credit_id":"64906b22559d2200c577cdea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cătălin Rotaru","original_name":"Cătălin Rotaru","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/s67o1JW2UFHE91YWvs3hjijA5ic.jpg","credit_id":"64906b2b42bf01011e74c97d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2994643,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan Azaharioaie","original_name":"Stefan Azaharioaie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64906b37263462012d4b5f49","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qODq04AhuXT0ogWH0TGBntkmSkD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
