The sight confused Cebolinha as he realized that Monica was actually obeying his commands. Astonishingly, Monica even went to the extent of uprooting a tree to provide shade for Cebolinha, who complained about being exposed to excessive sunlight. However, despite these acts of kindness, Monica eventually ended up beating him. Later, Cebolinha explained to Cascão that he had convinced Monica that every convict is entitled to one last wish.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Último Desejo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
