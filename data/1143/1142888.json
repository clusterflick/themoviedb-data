The documentary by Mario Bonetti and Giovanni Zanotti, sponsored by the Province of Brescia, offers a journey back in time, between the splendor of an ancient county and the end of peasant civilization. It tells the origins, history, art, present and future of a magical Italian village. From the voices of those who have lived in the country emerge unique and exciting stories that bring back old memories of a world that no longer exists.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/4mrEymTHCfSwG1YDcCrY6NUK7vM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The County in the Fog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4123069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Bonetti","original_name":"Mario Bonetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6492b85643cd540144a07969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4123070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Zanotti","original_name":"Giovanni Zanotti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6492b86043cd54012598ab87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LFN0iAF1ljNKkN4ICbi01PfAGx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/abvkfHXI1pjiL5u5lyohC0kM3kF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bYOnx7d4BXinr2CpSxFc9ReXIQ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ai1OgP7LG5he0gp4EQxGxMtc6Ih.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mK5Ju4Jc7tZdL5tKekhX7zfSbtP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Al0S1OKawxP2XvrYpty6gGK49hK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1000hcSDX8O3NN1AESYNqTzwkQr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2998,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4mrEymTHCfSwG1YDcCrY6NUK7vM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
