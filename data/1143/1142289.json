Lured by the dignified Marine uniform and the allure of the G.I. Bill, he's abruptly thrown into the bare, segregated world of Camp Montford Point, a far cry from the lush expansiveness of Camp Lejeune he'd imagined. The harsh realities of Southern segregation strike a jarring contrast to his accustomed diversity of Manhattan, escalating further with hostility from drill instructors. Undeterred, his resolve is galvanized by the dream of donning the Marine uniform and the prospects following discharge. Post-discharge, Johnson immerses himself in New York's music scene, enchanting audiences with his soulful, Sinatra-esque timbre. This riveting narrative portrays the unmatched fortitude of the Montford Point Marines, representing a crucial African-American, American, and globally relevant human experience.","popularity":0.576,"poster_path":"/j6zmIvsKyVINJ36TFevJcqHrs9B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A resilient American endures racial discrimination and physical abuse at Camp Montford Point, emerging as one of the first African American Marines.
