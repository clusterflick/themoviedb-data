In 1989, Park Soonam started to track down the survivors of the Battle of Okinawa to record their testimonies. In 1990, Park visits Korea in search of former “military laborers” who had survived Okinawa and repatriated to Korea. The survivors vividly recount their experiences of their compatriots’ murder and about the “comfort women” to the Zainichi Korean female director. The film zeroes in on the murder of Korean “military laborers” and the presence of “comfort women” in Okinawa via testimonies of former Japanese soldiers.","popularity":0.3308,"poster_path":"/j8RRM2sK0Z3aoiZGQGmmIHEsZxT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Song of Arirang Production Committee","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of Arirang - Voices from Okinawa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4890009,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ichitoku Miyauchi","original_name":"Ichitoku Miyauchi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bfbb9e1d245995f349e6f3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hara Masami","original_name":"Hara Masami","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bfbbd4b897ddc8f7ad7400","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1804121,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Isamu Katto","original_name":"Isamu Katto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bfbbc850532dab3d489cf2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462266,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Koshiro Otsu","original_name":"Koshiro Otsu","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bfbb8148ba16e0209da5c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tomizuka Ryoichi","original_name":"Tomizuka Ryoichi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bfbbb9956502353e9a0def","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2253277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Soo-nam","original_name":"朴壽南","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678141f53881c79419bb6c7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2213,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/j8RRM2sK0Z3aoiZGQGmmIHEsZxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8676,"name":"okinawa"},{"id":188727,"name":"imperial japan"},{"id":223181,"name":"comfort women"},{"id":273703,"name":"koreans in japan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
