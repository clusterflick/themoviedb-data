The film attempts to convey a sense of fear to the audience through sound, accompanied by a series of hand-drawn animations and digital graphics. Both audio and visuals are drawn from a collection of studies conducted over a period of time. It included recorded clips, music notes, sketches and characters that also evolved over time, experimental animation using charcoal, cutouts and pixelation, and several stories that eventually coalesced into one theme: supernatural fantasy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Train","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2325224,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kshitij Verma","original_name":"Kshitij Verma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bf8030318253e530ad70e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
