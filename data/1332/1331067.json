In it, Dante recounts his allegorical journey through the afterlife, guided first by Virgil and later by Beatrice. In the \"Inferno\", he descends through the nine circles of Hell, where sinners are punished. In the \"Purgatorio\", he ascends the mountain where souls undergo purification. In the \"Paradiso\", Dante, accompanied by Beatrice, ascends through the heavens, culminating in a vision of God. The work explores themes of divine justice, redemption, and love as a transcendent force.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Divina Comédia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
