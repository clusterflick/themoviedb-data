From the context of the room – designed to evoke the historic movie palaces that Burton frequented as a child – to the content of the film, Burton’s enduring relationship with cinema is evident throughout. Designing the Burtonesque features interviews with frequent collaborators, such as production designer Rick Heinrichs, and clips from films that have inspired him, like Ray Harryhausen’s \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" (1958). It provides a close analysis of stop motion animation and reveals Burton’s contributions to the advancement of this special craft.","popularity":0.3206,"poster_path":"/aiQs9M2RziENZ7cANCsicslnJCU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Designing the Burtonesque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Burton","original_name":"Tim Burton","popularity":2.5787,"profile_path":"/yHEHAHQpN9PfSEQx1UxZPczhcAi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"679443cd5a7d80731d1871f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rick Heinrichs","original_name":"Rick Heinrichs","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/hKTFePEYqeVYHQWOgbHS4RSoB0q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67a233f5beb8ffee852663f5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5201486,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomi Rose","original_name":"Tomi Rose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794438ac5081346f14851e1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5201488,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Victor Mazurek","original_name":"Victor Mazurek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679443b15a7d80731d187191","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4932771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Jimenez","original_name":"Carlos Jimenez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67944a420a30d6d05923b3d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4932771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Jimenez","original_name":"Carlos Jimenez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67944a5508c1729ec9186e84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1619,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiQs9M2RziENZ7cANCsicslnJCU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"First shown at exhibition \"The World of Tim Burton\" at The Design Museum, London 25/10/2024-21/04/2025.","release_date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
