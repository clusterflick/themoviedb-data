A bird, a human child, a fish and clouds – these are the images of the film, which are created and illuminated by the eternal sun. There is also the fiery Fox and The Wolf encountered in winter, also the little flying animal from the depths of the past. All of them live, rush, strive and yearn for the endless variations of being. One circle of The Sun, one life, moment and eternity here and there, in the mystical world \"beyond nine lakes\".","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/e97zFxtUzQptlhpq6EvM5upesCz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dauka","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2003-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Nine Lakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"За девятью озерами","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1662734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roze Stiebra","original_name":"Roze Stiebra","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qNmsEUHHeuD5D9jn6ezzGdQzQh4.jpg","credit_id":"6794172608c1729ec9186ba2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1662734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roze Stiebra","original_name":"Roze Stiebra","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qNmsEUHHeuD5D9jn6ezzGdQzQh4.jpg","credit_id":"6794172d559e2d974b48529d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893650,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dzintars Krūmiņš","original_name":"Dzintars Krūmiņš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794173908c1729ec9186ba6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ilze Vitolina","original_name":"Ilze Vitolina","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679417463be0b7b6f323a36f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895963,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valdis Muktupāvels","original_name":"Valdis Muktupāvels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679417513be0b7b6f323a374","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1662734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roze Stiebra","original_name":"Roze Stiebra","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qNmsEUHHeuD5D9jn6ezzGdQzQh4.jpg","credit_id":"6794176308c1729ec9186bc8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1662734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roze Stiebra","original_name":"Roze Stiebra","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/qNmsEUHHeuD5D9jn6ezzGdQzQh4.jpg","credit_id":"6794176e7660f09f3f48587f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e97zFxtUzQptlhpq6EvM5upesCz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
