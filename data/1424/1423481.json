This secondary forest is a place where natural and man-made elements interact, introduced and native species coexist, and past and present intertwine.  Abandoned tents languish under the trees. Animals and migratory birds rest on a trash bin and a broken concrete drain. Remnants of military facilities from the British colonial era and the Japanese occupation, as well as items left behind by migrant workers are scattered and buried in the forest. Layered onto this landscape is the unfathomable narrative of two travellers passing through the forest, who speak of things seen in the forest and things the forest sees.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/6uc86ST0zgHEFAaaG1L06zAsiLp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2024-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Owl, The Travellers, and The Cement Drain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yazid Jalil","original_name":"Yazid Jalil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Yazid","credit_id":"6794fbed760f51e17d2adfab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umi Kalthun","original_name":"Umi Kalthun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Umi","credit_id":"6794fc103be0b7b6f323bf8d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5131074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Zhao Renhui","original_name":"Robert Zhao Renhui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794fb8d760f51e17d2adf76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jang Young-gyu","original_name":"Jang Young-gyu","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/rfYABsdLHLwGGtJYQlbk3TxngdT.jpg","credit_id":"6794fba30a30d6d05923cdfe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jang Young-gyu","original_name":"Jang Young-gyu","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/rfYABsdLHLwGGtJYQlbk3TxngdT.jpg","credit_id":"6794fbc99a30a85b2723861e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":775,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTLlatjLZh6Y8wbWc61TbitSnjt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1378}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6uc86ST0zgHEFAaaG1L06zAsiLp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seeing Forest , Singapore Pavilion at the 60th Venice Biennale International Art Exhibition","release_date":"2024-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seeing Forest exhibition at the Singapore Art Museum","release_date":"2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
