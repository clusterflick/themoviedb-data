Happiness and cheer.  And for Peanuts fans everywhere. It just wouldn't be Christmas without this classic holiday delight.  Christmas lights may be twinkling red and green, but Charlie Brown has the Yuletide blues. To get in the holiday spirit, he takes Lucy's advice and directs the Christmas play. And what's a Christmas play without a Christmas tree? But everyone makes fun of the short, spindly nevergreen Charlie Brown brings back - until the real meaning of Christmas works its magic once again in this Remastered Live-Action Edition with Improved Picture and Audio.
