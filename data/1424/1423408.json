For former farm worker Fritz Marti, who likes to meditate expansively on his life in his smokehouse, there is something philosophical about this activity. Lucienne Lanaz has lived in Grandval in the Bernese Jura since 1974. “Feu, fumée, saucisse” was her first documentary film, marking the beginning of an extensive production in which her talent for film portraits clearly stands out. The intimate yet respectful way in which she portrays Fritz Marti is as unique as the man himself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zD4OJ32mJe0Pi6JuIYL3owmv0xP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1976-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feu, fumée, saucisse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Marti","original_name":"Fritz Marti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6794e04d760f51e17d2ad9e9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pio Corradi","original_name":"Pio Corradi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794e05f760f51e17d2ad9f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3708610,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucienne Lanaz","original_name":"Lucienne Lanaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794e06ffeac9b712623bcd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zD4OJ32mJe0Pi6JuIYL3owmv0xP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
