He found two local children with broken arms and on the verge of death without drinking water. When he regained consciousness, he found it unbelievable that a small child was herding cattle in a desolate area, and he was surprised by their dirty and uncivilized appearance. With the hospitality of a Mongolian, the boy threw his beloved goat and cooked it for him. But John was very upset when he couldn’t eat it. He was also very angry when the little water he had found for several days was thrown away in just one day. However, since the language barrier was not clear, he could not understand how the two of them felt.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gal Pictures","origin_country":"MN"},{"id":82874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mongol Film Group","origin_country":"MN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","name":"Mongolia"}],"release_date":"2012-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smell of Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","title":"Usnii uner","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5203823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ider Khuyagbaatar","original_name":"Ider Khuyagbaatar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bold","credit_id":"6795d078c7b01b72c723cb19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5203824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amina Chinbat","original_name":"Amina Chinbat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tuya","credit_id":"6795d08957975f1b0b18b39a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5203833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Bradbeer","original_name":"Jonathan Bradbeer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"John","credit_id":"6795d0aab500fc7ca318638d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5203834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsetsegdorj Byambasuren","original_name":"Tsetsegdorj Byambasuren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6795d0c3a6e41283f12afc3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3365293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagiiranz Nyam","original_name":"Dagiiranz Nyam","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/4CadennsGqsTxkHlWEcI1FXA5nU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Grandfather","credit_id":"6795d0d60a30d6d05923e386","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zolbayar Dorj","original_name":"Zolbayar Dorj","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/gt5BEbZ582fu7BignYPQY9Amxlb.jpg","credit_id":"6795d1230a30d6d05923e3b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zolbayar Dorj","original_name":"Zolbayar Dorj","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/gt5BEbZ582fu7BignYPQY9Amxlb.jpg","credit_id":"6795d131df4b0191ce2adaf9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zolbayar Dorj","original_name":"Zolbayar Dorj","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/gt5BEbZ582fu7BignYPQY9Amxlb.jpg","credit_id":"6795d13adf4b0191ce2adafc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5030808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lkhagvadorj Lkhagvajav","original_name":"Lkhagvadorj Lkhagvajav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6795d162df4b0191ce2adb12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060847,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ganzorig Chimedtseren","original_name":"Ganzorig Chimedtseren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6795d1efd4ba1725f12af4a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060847,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ganzorig Chimedtseren","original_name":"Ganzorig Chimedtseren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6795d211d4ba1725f12af4b3","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5105832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ariunbold Adiyasuren","original_name":"Ariunbold Adiyasuren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6795d2eed4ba1725f12af4d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5103557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Munkhzul Chuluunbat","original_name":"Munkhzul Chuluunbat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6795d30209c252e3ab239a29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mn","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TJ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mn","note":"International Film Festival “Didor”","release_date":"2012-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MFG USNII UNER","key":"qNTrWMIHbek","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-04-02T11:41:14.000Z","id":"6795d51b5a7d80731d18a727"}]}}}
