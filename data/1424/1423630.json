Of course, the fives literally grow over his head. They crawl out of the booklet and take Peter with them to the land of Fives. There he is naturalized and entered in the population register of the country of the lazy. Peter thinks it's wonderful here. He does not need to study and does not need to wash. However, over time, it bothers him that not only he is dirty, but the whole country is decaying, because no one works.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zensurenschlacht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Mau","original_name":"Carl Mau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"679538865a7d80731d1890fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2086861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Sacher","original_name":"Otto Sacher","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/u5zt4EfQCkuWk3pV9tbGPSPMUlE.jpg","credit_id":"679538bfdcb7abcb56184298","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2086861,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Sacher","original_name":"Otto Sacher","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/u5zt4EfQCkuWk3pV9tbGPSPMUlE.jpg","credit_id":"679538dbdcb7abcb561842bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193152,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Addy Kurth","original_name":"Addy Kurth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679538e3760f51e17d2ae53a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2287513,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Werner Baensch","original_name":"Werner Baensch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679538ecc7b01b72c723b659","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997152,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gerti Gruner","original_name":"Gerti Gruner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6795390a5a7d80731d18912b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442575","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
