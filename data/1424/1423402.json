The watchmaker from Le Locle, who commissioned the film from the Geneva-based company Cinégram S.A., performs physical feats in front of the camera. The most spectacular of these is a jump from a height of 40 meters into the Doubs on 19 July 1936, a record that remained unmatched for a long time. The landscapes of the Jura serve as the backdrop for Girard's sporting achievements, which go beyond nature and physical culture.","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":"/npkyODzexBfiG98er6w6HIZXjvS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinegram S.A.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1936-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plongeons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Girard","original_name":"Armand Girard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6794ded55a7d80731d18800c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npkyODzexBfiG98er6w6HIZXjvS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
