Re-enactments at Bulgakov’s house in the Podil neighbourhood are met with excerpts from films by Griffith, Lubitsch and Duvivier. The heady mix of storytelling techniques makes this film a hypnotising dream, confounding like the work of the writer himself.","popularity":0.1161,"poster_path":"/pG3KBBKpfVpjHdq0OzTX3JpzoY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contact Studio of the National Filmmakers' Union of
