The result was Big Little Feelings, which won the Silver Dove at the Leipzig Festival in 1964. In the years that followed, the idea of including their own child in some of their films did not sit well with the political bureaucrats. In the end, she would only feature briefly in two short sequences at the end of this and another documentary, filmed eleven years later with the same children (The Feelings Have Grown, 1975). In both films, Doru Segall proudly makes clear that he is both the film’s cinematographer and the father of the girl in the image—a personal, autobiographic detail unusual for a Sahia film. Over the following years, the Segalls continued to work on documentaries about children, including Exams (1976), The High Schoolers (1978), Parents Meeting (1980), and The School Leavers (1986).","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":204889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sahia Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parents' Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ioan Pelz","original_name":"Ioan Pelz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679411630a30d6d05923aaa6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102358,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mariana Andruta","original_name":"Mariana Andruta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67941179c5081346f1484ca3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3713388,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maia Stepanenco","original_name":"Maia Stepanenco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794119e0a30d6d05923aad8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3713390,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Theodor Apetrei","original_name":"Theodor Apetrei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679411aefeac9b712623a47c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102377,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Liviu Pelz","original_name":"Liviu Pelz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679411ccc7b01b72c723913c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187618,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Marin Puceanu","original_name":"Marin Puceanu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679411de5a7d80731d186cd6","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102376,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mihaela Surgescu","original_name":"Mihaela Surgescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679412d608c1729ec9186a17","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5187621,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elena Cezar","original_name":"Elena Cezar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679412ec90390f48811870f0","department":"Crew","job":"Title Graphics"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4293957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Segall","original_name":"Paula Segall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679413000a30d6d05923ab2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2340103,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Doru Segal","original_name":"Doru Segal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6794131090390f4881187108","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
