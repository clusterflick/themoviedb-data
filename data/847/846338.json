To pay for his studies, he works part-time at a roadside cafe, and one day it is right there, where he meets Dr Louise, an unhappy married woman, with whom he tries to find his happiness. His home life is also not very wonderful: there is a motorcycle 'corridor' on his track and they try to exercise their kind of human service: with fists and chains.  His background in the back streets is his past: his profession as a doctor and servant is his future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wngjYhvZnujGuIyzDrUXsZMifan.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr. Marius Hugo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wngjYhvZnujGuIyzDrUXsZMifan.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1053}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"af","note":"","release_date":"1978-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
