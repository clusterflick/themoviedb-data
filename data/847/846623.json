The film begins with a gathering of animated multi-national characters attending the “International Convention of Movie Fans”. In order to keep everyone’s attention they agree to “…say it with movies”. The animated curtains part, and we are transported to the center of the motion picture industry – Kodak Park – where 147,000 miles of motion-picture film were produced in 1921, enough to circle the globe. A Movie Trip Through Filmland takes the viewer through every step of the film manufacturing process, and recounts some amazing statistics. This is a rare glimpse into an industry and manufacturing process that today is rapidly being overtaken by new digital technologies.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/tJBTafaLDdFvdPQ75TUXnkDAzzu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Movie Trip Through Filmland","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph DeFrenes","original_name":"Joseph DeFrenes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de00b6ef9d7200478dbc1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4868206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nHqmZ1BA2qPlG6DtvsDNR7gkRAa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tJBTafaLDdFvdPQ75TUXnkDAzzu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
