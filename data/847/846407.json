The layering of architectural forms and spaces in conjunction with abstracted text creates a visual labyrinth in which multiple mirrored surfaces collide. Wong’s video documents Rea’s Mirror Maze, an installation consisting of symbols and patterns painted onto large convex security mirrors. The mirrored planes and cryptic text used to decipher information reference modern information systems and other myriad forms of technology. Splicing and fusing of architectural forms and transparent walls in this maze simulate an environment of reflected and reflecting surfaces that parallel Wong’s interest in discovering his own identity.","popularity":0.0969,"poster_path":"/qp97wv20Dc7BRAzTWhx3HWWWsgW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running In a Maze","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2979508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Rea","original_name":"Charles Rea","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60dd11e02d372100464d0304","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Hackett","original_name":"Carole Hackett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60dd11eb960cde0046c46c0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Hackett","original_name":"Cynthia Hackett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60dd11f5ef9d7200478c23e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hackett","original_name":"James Hackett","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60dd12130ff15a002e96a356","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2979497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wong","original_name":"Paul Wong","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/nlwZppEVRRkjYk7XRZb1gwP5Wpr.jpg","credit_id":"60dd1235976e4800250f5fd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2979497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wong","original_name":"Paul Wong","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/nlwZppEVRRkjYk7XRZb1gwP5Wpr.jpg","credit_id":"60dd123e992fe6002c424b1b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2979497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wong","original_name":"Paul Wong","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/nlwZppEVRRkjYk7XRZb1gwP5Wpr.jpg","credit_id":"60dd12439974ee0047b69343","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2979508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Rea","original_name":"Charles Rea","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd12689974ee0075178da1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qp97wv20Dc7BRAzTWhx3HWWWsgW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Running in a Maze","key":"54119392","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-11-23T01:58:33.000Z","id":"60dd1286cb9f4b005f5cc348"}]}}}
