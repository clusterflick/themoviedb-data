The film follows Abeer Ahmed, a young woman growing up in the Jabaliya Refugee Camp, the largest refugee camp in Gaza, as she and the other members of her cast and crew prepare to put on a play that focuses on a Palestinian woman’s right to receive inheritance.  While the content of the play is tailored towards fostering a cultural discussion among Palestinians, neither the play nor the playhouse can escape the omnipresence of the Israeli siege on Gaza.  A siege that shatters literal buildings as well as the hopes and dreams of the performers and community members who take refuge within the walls of al-Mishal in search of artistic fulfillment.","popularity":0.2309,"poster_path":"/imWZ2cDFjzQLm0L68isfD66LeS8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Play Before The Bombs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2111935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abeer Ahmed","original_name":"Abeer Ahmed","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60dd49c8b686b90046e2bc01","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2084521,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roger Hill","original_name":"Roger Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h4adsOOK3DdIHvz5DTafEBPFmeJ.jpg","credit_id":"60dd49de6c449c002de5a6bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142398,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Motaaz Al-araj","original_name":"Motaaz Al-araj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd4a53d95420005d3247fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2111937,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Paq","original_name":"Anne Paq","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd49fc960cde0026f3487c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nitin Sawhney","original_name":"Nitin Sawhney","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd4a1cd95420002b5d1862","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142323,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ziiyad Bakri","original_name":"Ziiyad Bakri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd4abd976e48005e35bf6d","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142399,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mohammed Zaanoun","original_name":"Mohammed Zaanoun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd4a689974ee005e87cc89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Manos","original_name":"Eli Manos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd4aaa976e4800250fe9dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2084521,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roger Hill","original_name":"Roger Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h4adsOOK3DdIHvz5DTafEBPFmeJ.jpg","credit_id":"60dd49e5a12856007494662a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anas Hamra","original_name":"Anas Hamra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dd4a2b9979d2007f4676db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1088,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/imWZ2cDFjzQLm0L68isfD66LeS8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":726}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Leeds","release_date":"2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
