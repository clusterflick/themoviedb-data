The video installation provides an ephemeral form where interdisciplinary elements from the disparate past are configured with unsettling current issues and produced as a new whole. Fleeting moments, manipulated images, visual clips, still photographs, text, narrative stories, home movies, sound bites, edited fiction and real time documents will be digitally seamed and beamed onto transparent surfaces. The video projections shown in a moving vaporetto (sea bus) will transport both the work and audience on a journey. The time-based work will float by the post-modernism of Venice, a rich port for thriving trade and now in the 50th edition of the Venice Biennale, the international art market converges to make the trade. This work is a site of memory where the very private becomes public. It is a virtual ‘walking the mountain’, a way to honour and remember those who have gone before.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/95KrHPDydyFv2ycMw1EKBBrFxWP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156587,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Edge","origin_country":""},{"id":156600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nuova Icona","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry Ghosts Mix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2979497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wong","original_name":"Paul Wong","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/nlwZppEVRRkjYk7XRZb1gwP5Wpr.jpg","credit_id":"60dc0f11ae28110027a436f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3141007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elspeth Sage","original_name":"Elspeth Sage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc0f185690b5002e3ada70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95KrHPDydyFv2ycMw1EKBBrFxWP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
