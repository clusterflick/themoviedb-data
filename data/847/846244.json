Drawing on contributions from critics, scholars and the actor’s colleagues, this documentary deciphers the keys to the de Funès phenomenon, intelligently analysing the peculiar characters of his facial and corporeal mimicry, the plasticity of his gestures, and the doubling of character and creator (in the sense that, once he became successful, ‘Fufu’ effectively became the author of the majority of his films, often limiting the director’s role).","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/ixRZRblqh4vM74ADWLXp5KDFi3B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louis de Funès, Créature/Créateur","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis de Funès","original_name":"Louis de Funès","popularity":2.0675,"profile_path":"/8R8WVggSEKxxT4n2HRKHjxHrIQZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"617edd6ea3d02700429e2326","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baptiste Etchegaray","original_name":"Baptiste Etchegaray","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc935ecb9f4b005f5b8caf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Perge","original_name":"Nicolas Perge","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662f2c8c1f0275012414a957","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14979878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qlOMPaFG8stThreS4AL9QoEJNWn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3A1xG4qOKdbaJ6krZEyAu4fzePh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/caCCl7ubR3VB8akBOeUXoRaB19w.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4eaQkCAFspdIQwV7RpiGga0I0lx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ixRZRblqh4vM74ADWLXp5KDFi3B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Paris Première","release_date":"2021-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
