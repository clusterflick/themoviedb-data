The work revolves around this phrase, whose words appear and disappear in the course of the sequence of images, disjointed from the cohesion that brings them together only at the end of the video to form that programmatic declaration that defends independence. The sentence is thus evidenced as a procedural symbolic knot, the result of a complex history and its possible articulations. The images of the video, in a constant swaying of a boat in the water, open up to the dimensions of the immensity of that sea that serves Bolivar as a metaphorization of the magnitude of the hatred that forces him to revolt against the colonizers. It is a sea in which is inscribed, in turn, a new history, which, as a possible reading, forces us to think of other colonizations and economic dependencies.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/9488GiroxnV0vbPSnK2IaGT355u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2009-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(In)continente","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3142889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Aravena Abughosh","original_name":"Claudia Aravena Abughosh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ddff475690b5007fab37f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1275,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9488GiroxnV0vbPSnK2IaGT355u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"(IN)CONTINENTE","key":"134503920","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-07-25T19:31:06.000Z","id":"60ddff7127ff99005df14df5"}]}}}
