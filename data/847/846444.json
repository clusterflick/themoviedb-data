Roommates Stu and Ben certainly do. It pretty much describes every single night they've had for the last 3 years. However, when Stu gets a parking ticket one fateful evening, the time for talking is over. The two conspire together with the help of their neighbors to create a movement that will change the political landscape in America in ways this country could have never imagined. But as the night goes on, and their plans get bigger, will their friendship survive their midnight revelation?","popularity":0.0696,"poster_path":"/vbanB1A5NYxaoNYRX5gMGnjD5Ch.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kill All Politicians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7098974","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vbanB1A5NYxaoNYRX5gMGnjD5Ch.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
