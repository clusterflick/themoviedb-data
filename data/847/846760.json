The film shows the present situation of the director and five of her friends who went to university together. The women, who shared a set of values and a common faith under the feminist political umbrella, now live their own lives with their own families. Each of them struggles to define ‘family values’ in her own words, free from traditional heterosexuality, femininity, and religion.","popularity":0.1525,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Gabe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hali Hammer","original_name":"Hali Hammer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65046270ea37e000c6394940","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lamb","original_name":"James Lamb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65046287ffc9de0ee20af0e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debra Levy","original_name":"Debra Levy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65046293d7dcd200acb25d7d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hara Person","original_name":"Hara Person","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65046299ea37e001005290e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Spencer","original_name":"Kim Spencer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"650462a5e0ca7f00ec8ea679","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Page Ulrey","original_name":"Page Ulrey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"650462aad7dcd200ffedc14c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1727035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Juhasz","original_name":"Alexandra Juhasz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/prNwDrKHLGhO2mk0apV78MbAtvR.jpg","credit_id":"60de49fc9979d2007f483f6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1537453","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
