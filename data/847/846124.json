It took place in two U.K. ports in October 1996: on the West Coast in Whitehaven, Cumbria (the last English slaving port), in an 18th century bonded warehouse used to store liquor and guns used in the slave trade; and on the East Coast in Hull, Yorkshire in Wilberforce House, the birthplace of the anti-slavery pioneer William Wilberforce and now a museum of anti-slavery. The production took place over a 3-week period that began Sept. 30, 1996.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/4f4BrO64JU3ai60T4IWjuBGJtPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Locus
