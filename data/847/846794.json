Just 22 years later, in May 1962, a new cathedral designed by Basil Spence was consecrated on the site. Built in a bold modern style, incorporating the ruins of the old cathedral and adorned with a wealth of modern artworks, Coventry Cathedral is recognised today as one of Britain's greatest postwar buildings. Using a wealth of rarely seen archive film, together with voices from yesterday and today, the film tells the story of the new cathedral and of the times in which it was created.","popularity":0.1041,"poster_path":"/oOljS4FeT8kjusX3orKuBH3X2eL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coventry Cathedral: Building for a New Britain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1342414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Black","original_name":"Pauline Black","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60de72cab686b9002d5e7085","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wyver","original_name":"John Wyver","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":"/yHuOcIl8fCdfpHJlkEHT85cnssX.jpg","credit_id":"60de73a06c449c002de7d357","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wyver","original_name":"John Wyver","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":"/yHuOcIl8fCdfpHJlkEHT85cnssX.jpg","credit_id":"60de73969979d200294674dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oOljS4FeT8kjusX3orKuBH3X2eL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
