He is however, frustrated with his life and longs for more than just being “The King of a Pack of Losers“. One day, while walking home after buying a collection, he stumbles into nasty Mickey and his “kinky’ girlfriend Priscilla -who takes a shine to him. The vicious and jealous Mickey sets Calvin on a life transformation. Highly stylized, remarkably good acting “The Gramophone Man” is full of bizarre twists and turns (one sequence features Jack Smith of “Flaming Creatures” in an outrageous Drag Queen outfit), With intense humor and distorted pathos, the film barrows towards its powerful finale.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gramophone Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Devensky","original_name":"David Devensky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc0878960cde005d2afe52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
