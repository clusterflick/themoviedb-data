In a personal and moving film, he recalls his boyhood memories to explore the memories of the city and the memories of its people. No city in Europe suffered so much destruction in the Second World War, no city rose up so heroically from the ashes. The Nazis had razed Warsaw to the ground, but after the war the people fought hard to bring their city back from the dead in one of the greatest reconstruction jobs in history. As a boy, Cruickshank lived in the rebuilt old town and it inspired his love of architecture and made him the man he is today.","popularity":0.2872,"poster_path":"/mqDgdOZLS4EpL12pG7mFvG6kDM2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dan Cruickshank: Resurrecting History: Warsaw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dan Cruickshank's Warsaw: Resurrecting History","type":"Original Broadcast Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Cruickshank","original_name":"Dan Cruickshank","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/xPjt3RGFIgV86loMo40OMKIAIHO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"60de8b7bb686b9002d5eb71b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Cruickshank","original_name":"Dan Cruickshank","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/xPjt3RGFIgV86loMo40OMKIAIHO.jpg","credit_id":"60de8b8b6c449c00477c1e5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dunn","original_name":"Tim Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de8b9cd95420007ea642a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dunn","original_name":"Tim Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f0a07415376c007817f6c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5269836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mqDgdOZLS4EpL12pG7mFvG6kDM2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
