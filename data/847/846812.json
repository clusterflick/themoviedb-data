We look at things and the world differently than before, so that things don’t always repeat themselves, but get better instead: Two boys meet on a round trip with the Hamburg U3 line. Something evolves – not much but yet everything. The train runs through station after station. Lights changing on the outside and inside. Passengers and protagonists in the midst of noise & music. Glances, silence, a KitKat is broken, a Coke is being drunk. Outside: sunset & nightfall constantly interrupted by tunnels, platforms, posters & facades. The train passes the boarding station again. The timeline of love could be a circle. A common sensations music movie.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/iOIm7ULcXxp1e3X9qK0i67D3kP8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FIRST TIME [The Time for All but Sunset – VIOLET]","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"First Time: The Time for All but Sunset - Violet","type":"original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1820948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Hilmer","original_name":"Aaron Hilmer","popularity":0.3391,"profile_path":"/wVVbhpjsDeC6GI9Pa37qqbuVhZd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61661c7e50733c0042fa5c48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1906583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fynn Grossmann","original_name":"Fynn Grossmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61661c8262fcd300634f8737","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolaas Schmidt","original_name":"Nicolaas Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2C41D9HnSkjYcwLGY971WGYFzP0.jpg","credit_id":"60de7e89a128560046a30875","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14972106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tUk76EoZN1fVCjt7nDYsbGfSDS4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x7VT7nuFuzry6EipDtNB2eiTj77.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iOIm7ULcXxp1e3X9qK0i67D3kP8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mvcOlcVwxK4f6tYeOZxTLUC0cqB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lbe5zAyrfjlqavhQgYinwITGnXg.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":849},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rkCWzUoMP7GW6FrPYhH98kWI0ee.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"First Time [The Time for All but Sunset (Violet)] (teaser) – First Look 2022","key":"2_EOrupLJ8M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-18T21:41:14.000Z","id":"6302433c097c490091108850"}]}}}
