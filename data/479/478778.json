Before the execution of the new development, all the villages on this land will soon be buried into continuous muck dunes. On the open grounds, there stocked huge piles of second-hand machines which would be resold in the southeastern countries. Estate investigation teams gathered in different groups, were talking about the potential prices of the land. After passing some huge muck dunes, between two higher muck dunes, the hunters built their sheltered pits and bird traps in the air. They tied a bee to a transparent string as it would lead them to the beehives hidden in the cracks. Fishermen even found a source of fish in the swamp that connects the groundwater. The men and women in the giant ferroconcrete caves on the clouds were still chattering about the bullfrogs from lunch.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/g3PVGGZ4JAYqh9ALbo0Lw97yu8A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2017-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Worldly Cave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Worldly Cave","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Fán Dòng","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhou Tao","original_name":"Zhou Tao","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/7CaMqzTM19OYf3pIa4i9KBmzlUq.jpg","credit_id":"59cf14a7c3a3681e9700ecbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9081620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xt4Dd1MfdgSopL37DMuXhBASCP6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g3PVGGZ4JAYqh9ALbo0Lw97yu8A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Biennale","release_date":"2017-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2017-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
