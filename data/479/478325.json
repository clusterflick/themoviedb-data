Metaphorically, they address a story about departure, waiting and separation, dictated by migrations. In the early 20th century, it was usual yet traumatic for men to leave Croatian islands (mostly bound for the countries of South America) due to poverty and hunger. One of these tragic stories is weaved into the author’s family history. The installation is inspired by the life story of Renata’s great-grandmother who lived on the island of Brač, whose husband went to Chile looking for work in order to secure his family’s future. Like many of the island’s women, she waited for her husband who, like many of the men, never returned.","popularity":0.3115,"poster_path":"/rKYyTixnNNJQJbMezsQEicKKQpS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Udruga REA","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partenza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1831014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dajana Čuljak","original_name":"Dajana Čuljak","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e146f155907de0012e238fe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renata Poljak","original_name":"Renata Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59cbf8a59251412b8b0176a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renata Poljak","original_name":"Renata Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e146f296262080014c569d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11095114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rKYyTixnNNJQJbMezsQEicKKQpS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":1248,"name":"croatia"},{"id":209309,"name":"adriatic coast"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
