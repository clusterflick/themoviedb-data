The film presents a sequence of close-up shots of a male and a female mouth that trade gestures and expressions, creating an ambiguous dialogue, an oblique reference to the hardships of a female artist and the censorship and violence of the Brazilian dictatorship.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/ez9FgjRA2n7StgFfiK1Ca2Jxrhq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In-Out (Antropofagia)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Maria Maiolino","original_name":"Anna Maria Maiolino","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pEhG8dUkGLbjJWGZrp9b7pbdeYU.jpg","credit_id":"59ce92a1c3a3686a9201bb08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ez9FgjRA2n7StgFfiK1Ca2Jxrhq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
