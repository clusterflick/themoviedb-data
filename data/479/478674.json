Two episodes will be screened. In \"Ragnar Kjartansson + Iceland\", one of the most important artists of contemporary art prepares a retrospective at the Reykjavík Museum of Art, exploring his connection with the country's culture. In \"Henri Cartier-Bresson + India\" we discover how the photographer met Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. His camera recorded the leader’s last appearance on night before his assassination. The photographs helped catapult Cartier-Bresson to international fame as a photojournalist.","popularity":0.0474,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95606,"logo_path":"/n9kM8HFoeBGhPGlzmQ5LcnzecUe.png","name":"Producing Partners","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inspired","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1444536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guto Barra","original_name":"Guto Barra","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/aZZVJTjgvXSVn1ysxtIKGwaflq7.jpg","credit_id":"59ce90809251416c2001f0d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1444536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guto Barra","original_name":"Guto Barra","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/aZZVJTjgvXSVn1ysxtIKGwaflq7.jpg","credit_id":"59ce9090c3a3686a7e01c4d1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Issa","original_name":"Tatiana Issa","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/oWPWQ8EVA1widkfykRXvbc10qMn.jpg","credit_id":"59ce909cc3a3686a6301e11c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Issa","original_name":"Tatiana Issa","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/oWPWQ8EVA1widkfykRXvbc10qMn.jpg","credit_id":"59ce90a6c3a3686a9201b7c6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1897019,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Flávia Salama","original_name":"Flávia Salama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ce90bdc3a3686aa901e3ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897020,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gustavo Nasr","original_name":"Gustavo Nasr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ce90cb9251416c2001f176","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897021,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rodrigo Brazão","original_name":"Rodrigo Brazão","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ce90dd9251416c7701db73","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897022,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paulo Testolini","original_name":"Paulo Testolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ce90eb9251416c5901d1b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
