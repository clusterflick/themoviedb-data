Sikandar and Shab are final-year art students at Kabul University, both with a thirst for life. Amidst the ruins of war-torn Kabul, the couple and their friends spot an abandoned cinema, which miraculously survived 30 years of war. As an act of resistance against the looming return of fundamentalism, a bold dream is enacted and renovation work on the cinema begins. Serious problems soon arise: the withdrawal of powerful family support, the targeting of Shab by her extremist brother, an auto accident and a calamitous fire. Undaunted, Sikandar continues to pursue the dream.","popularity":0.1144,"poster_path":"/kAO924UyvZRHe3jNB9JUWv5podf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taimani Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"2017-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kabullywood","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohd Qais Shaghasy","original_name":"Mohd Qais Shaghasy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Qais","credit_id":"59c9fe57c3a36803c7004ca6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farid Joya","original_name":"Farid Joya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Khaled","credit_id":"59c9fe76c3a36803ba0057e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roya Heydari","original_name":"Roya Heydari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Shab","credit_id":"59c9fea592514123b900554b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omid Rawendah","original_name":"Omid Rawendah","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sikandar","credit_id":"59c9fec292514123b9005553","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghulam Reza Rajabi","original_name":"Ghulam Reza Rajabi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mustafa","credit_id":"59c9fed6925141240a005341","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Meunier","original_name":"Louis Meunier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9fef9c3a3680393005344","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1894851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thierry Bréant","original_name":"Thierry Bréant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9ff7592514123b90055dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894850,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laurent Maréchaux","original_name":"Laurent Maréchaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9ff1b92514123b50058f7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariel Nasr","original_name":"Ariel Nasr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9ff3092514123c100595c","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Meunier","original_name":"Louis Meunier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9ff4a925141240a0053bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Meunier","original_name":"Louis Meunier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59c9ff02c3a36803b70058f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095835,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antoine Marteau","original_name":"Antoine Marteau","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a967da30e0a265441006d92","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3705668","wikidata_id":"Q65965634","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kAO924UyvZRHe3jNB9JUWv5podf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8UeoUKQKeawWLjsE0bbIOH79ou5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8kKaWUKMjUMbzfvX9QFPrhVEcUQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kabullywood (2019) -
