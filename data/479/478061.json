Nuon Chea, also known as Brother No. 2, was the second man after Pol Pot in the Khmer Rouge regime. He is being charged with mass murder and crimes against humanity. For four years, the documentary follows the lawyers in their attempt to give this man a fair trial, but the UN tribunal is beset by local interests and a government which consists partly of other former members of the Khmer Rouge who would really like all of the blame to rest solely on the defendant. What should've been the crowning achievement in the careers of the lawyers turns out very different.","popularity":0.5283,"poster_path":"/dIM7RSbmbGyb9lTMJk69vUv6vpo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Defending Brother No.2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Bouma","original_name":"Hans Bouma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ca12d392514123b900669b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1586418,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maarten Kramer","original_name":"Maarten Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ca12e1925141241400662a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1155115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorien van Nes","original_name":"Jorien van Nes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/c958NiuGNPkAkXJHGCZBiOP1xyw.jpg","credit_id":"59ca127a92514123c1006b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1894899,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pim Hawinkels","original_name":"Pim Hawinkels","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yc2LEi4lmPSsqPI0RpzdBFI3qQP.jpg","credit_id":"59ca12c292514123bd006d51","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894898,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gideon Levy","original_name":"Gideon Levy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ca128fc3a36803ba006a8e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1126,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dIM7RSbmbGyb9lTMJk69vUv6vpo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2960,"name":"cambodia"},{"id":11038,"name":"trial"},{"id":10859,"name":"tribunal"},{"id":10909,"name":"lawyer"},{"id":15053,"name":"united nations"},{"id":193730,"name":"khmer rouge"},{"id":238296,"name":"nuon chea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
