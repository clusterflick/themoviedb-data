D. Laings anti-psychiatry movement. In 1965, a community of 20 people-anti-psychiatry leaders, including Laing himself, and their former patients-move in together. Over the next five years, they collectively explore the definitions of madness. The film re-appraises the culture of oppressive psychiatry and multinational pharmaceutical companies.","popularity":0.0452,"poster_path":"/73kHGPW70EmE7kPlFyraYmZLuhT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What You See Is Where You’re At","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"59ced4179251412f31006f57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/73kHGPW70EmE7kPlFyraYmZLuhT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
