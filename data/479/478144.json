Experiments, rivalry and new loves lead them to redefine who they are and how they view life.  Five men from an amateur soccer team go for a short trip to a lake in Brandenburg. Out of boredom, very soon, they forget their inhibitions, reveal a lot about themselves and make themselves vulnerable, resulting in various conflicts. One of the men meets a much younger woman who rekindles a long suppressed longing in him and makes him take a fateful decision.","popularity":0.0997,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":256496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filter Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Out","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Meller","original_name":"Robert Meller","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/fBLgdPcC64RBr4dRe8hBr4Iow22.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"67d729f825f01d54167bf56c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Irrek","original_name":"Mario Irrek","popularity":0.2262,"profile_path":"/lYM1TJBrm4MVr7lyUaqHkl1J2Bt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Krissi","credit_id":"67d72a2d9165f37118015817","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1895829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivien LaFleur","original_name":"Vivien LaFleur","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vivien","credit_id":"67d72a5f25f01d54167bf5c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Neuhaus","original_name":"Martin Neuhaus","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/5ERMm4atF1ps7Ok6EUP4sMgWUDk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maik","credit_id":"67d72a9125f01d54167bf5fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1397435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Zimmermann","original_name":"Ben Zimmermann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"67d72ad625f01d54167bf62b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1824017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Baum","original_name":"Robert Baum","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sascha","credit_id":"67d72b1a25f01d54167bf647","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Wegner","original_name":"Sven Wegner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ca8ba2c3a36803c700cbb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Wegner","original_name":"Sven Wegner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d729bdd802309703f163a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
