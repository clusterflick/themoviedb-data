The original film shows the city in straightforward shots and camera movements. Due to deterioration these images changed in a dramatic way. In the adaption Karel Doing zooms in on these effects with the aid of digital techniques like optical flow and morphing. Michal Osowski collaborated on the project with sound that is directely linked to the image, he used the changes in density of the film to control complex filters and distortion effects.","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":"/mPtnwlfp46G3C7TH3N0HpVPnMc5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doing Film","origin_country":""},{"id":95556,"logo_path":"/gMsu30npr1bSVn7jAjJ2A2jO6S8.png","name":"EYE Film Institute Netherlands","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liquidator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michal Osowski","original_name":"Michal Osowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59cd21dbc3a3682a7e018c04","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Doing","original_name":"Karel Doing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9wgagOLeWNEXpjODlIPQMulXpWn.jpg","credit_id":"59cd21c9c3a3682ac0017196","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3617300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":867,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mPtnwlfp46G3C7TH3N0HpVPnMc5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Liquidator","key":"105745564","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-09-10T10:07:52.000Z","id":"61757764894ed6002339f655"}]}}}
