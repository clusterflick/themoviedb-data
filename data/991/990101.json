Inspired by artists of the Abstract Expressionism movement such as Willem de Kooning and Philip Guston, Murray was privy to their technique and motive. Though she may share ideals with her artistic predecessors, Murray has created miraculously original work which she discusses with curator Robert Storr as they explore her MoMA retrospective.","popularity":0.3625,"poster_path":"/4vYTvFuSnZmRRKZ4r40TBJxCiO6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elizabeth Murray: 4 Decades","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Murray","original_name":"Elizabeth Murray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b0c75cf5f1c500511eeeb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Storr","original_name":"Robert Storr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b0c768f5f1c50061e5e58c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"62b0c73c3faba0008c10b9ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11426750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4vYTvFuSnZmRRKZ4r40TBJxCiO6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
