From the chaotic concert at the Salle Vallier in Marseille in 1966, to the recording of \"Exile on Main Street\", their album written under the influence in a villa on the Côte d'Azur, to Mick Jagger's mythical wedding in Saint-Tropez, the British rock band has lived through some crazy French years. Never-before-seen images and interviews with collaborators, rock critics and musicians lift the veil on the Stones' passionate relationship with France.","popularity":0.968,"poster_path":"/6gcZof0oqJ4Xgr2MDemRvDaIC2x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88002,"logo_path":"/zV5SSl4WlW9Dh63M9dqhZiEPRCF.png","name":"Bangumi","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France
