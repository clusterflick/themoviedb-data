Stepping back from painting in order to explore her photorealistic drawing style, Celmins creates spectacularly precise renderings of the natural world. In her forty year retrospective at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, Celmins recalls her beginnings in abstraction, her choices of subject matter after freeing herself of the New York School influence, and her later immersion in what must be termed her great master drawings.","popularity":0.1616,"poster_path":"/adfifE1F9DBY3PZU42oP3JB8Emn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vija Celmins: 4 Decades","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Garrels","original_name":"Gary Garrels","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b0c2edecc7e800f179c4cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vija Celmins","original_name":"Vija Celmins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b0c30296386400516e153d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"62b0c2be9638640092ff730e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11433462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4nx2IbO95woW9bdLdLtBjDGLlfl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/adfifE1F9DBY3PZU42oP3JB8Emn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
