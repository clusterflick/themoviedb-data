With the passage of time, the big clan becomes fragmented as members, like other modern Chinese in mainland China, face changes in lives, ideals, and family structures. The occasion becomes a hot ground for deals and negotiations that are inevitable amid the rapid development of China, where family members prosper while relationships become calculated. Still, a funeral procession amid an impending storm requires them, already down different paths, to walk together.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/zvCPk0WuFhOLOJCsUEMd5VuiDfk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walk with the Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596575,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lam Tung-hei","original_name":"Lam Tung-hei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b19c066beaea0092f0c40f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596576,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lam Tung-hei","original_name":"Lam Tung-hei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b19c0f90cf510053513487","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/zvCPk0WuFhOLOJCsUEMd5VuiDfk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"16th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
