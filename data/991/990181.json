Kyoshin Kayo survived the WW2 bombings of Japan, living through very tough conditions. He was taught by one of the 4 great masters of karate Kenwa Mabuni, and then developed karate schools all through Japan before coming to Australia for the first time in 1971. He was hugely influential in the establishment of karate here and the teaching of important philosophies and life skills to hundreds of people. He was also the owner of the first noodle restaurant in Australia.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensei Australia's Karate Master","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
