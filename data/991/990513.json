If you've never seen any demos on the C16 and Plus/4 then you are in for a treat! They are very similar in style to Commodore 64 demos but some feature additional colours and effects not possible even on the mighty C64! Also, a SID card has been used for the recordings of these demos so you can enjoy the productions with REAL SID Music! As an extra bonus the DVD contains a picture gallery of Commodore 16 and Plus 4 demoscene graphics.","popularity":0.0606,"poster_path":"/k22IdGLXClMsER5Pa7PjR0jt8Ae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Family: Commodore 16 and Plus/4 Demoscene Collection","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k22IdGLXClMsER5Pa7PjR0jt8Ae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
