As well as being a record of the role of the colonial administration, Along the Sepik offers insights into some tribal communities' cultures through depictions of their spirit houses and traditional 'sing sing' ceremonies. Downes investigates a murder, and the culprit is caught and tried by a magistrate in a jungle courthouse under the Australian flag, on the edge of the Sepik River. Australian patrol officers and their men operated under rugged conditions to bring western law and order to this remote area. The film also portrays some of the impact the colonial government had on regional, traditional communities.","popularity":0.3048,"poster_path":"/iKIPDUrThzjaDQ6REJlJTCIUPQw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Along the Sepik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Dunlop","original_name":"Ian Dunlop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b28049a24c50006284c8e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Gow","original_name":"Keith Gow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656e5a88886348014d856a62","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.
