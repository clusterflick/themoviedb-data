Gubble can also be seen as a metaphor for post-boom decay, neglect, and a slippage of collective reality. In this work, I'm exploring a constantly evolving and unstable feedback network as forms develop and destroy themselves. Both the audio and video here are created through chaotic and generative processes, culminating in an audiovisual abstraction that both invites and defies comparison to a familiar cohesive reality. The gubble is everywhere, taking over the visual field. Is everything falling apart or is it growing into something?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dWazMOTyB0mRAgQoymTbtgHTWJg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gubble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Benson","original_name":"Andrew Benson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0c0cceb093200512207ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Benson","original_name":"Andrew Benson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0c0d990cf51008d4ec702","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dWazMOTyB0mRAgQoymTbtgHTWJg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":623}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
