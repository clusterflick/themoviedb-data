It is the Latin iteration of a concept attributed to the Stoics who were active in Athens at a time when Olympia was thriving as a pilgrimage site for both devotional rites and ceremonial games from the 3rd century BCE until well into the age of the Roman Empire. The color footage in amor fati, including the black intervals, was recorded at the stadium of Ancient Olympia in the summer of 2016. The black and white was shot there in the summer of 2012.","popularity":0.0836,"poster_path":"/8va2M10r9dHkEwSLirMr0ddK7kf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"amor fati","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"F.P.
