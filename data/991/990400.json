Sally works as a hostess, a kind of life her unruly son Keith loathes and from which he seeks refuge through self-harm. Keith looks with longing for the seemingly happy and loving relationship between mentally-ill Mandy and her son Luke. Yearning to become part of the other family, Keith wishes Mandy were his mother instead. But will that ever be possible? The sympathetic Mandy and Luke try to help Keith, and when they think things are looking better... Subtly told, Mommies captures the human condition of Hong Kong people’s lives seldom seen.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/aWcpSHLJnCBVxLxsAR7psKgDylA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mommies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaw Mei-kwan","original_name":"Shaw Mei-kwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62b19eb3bf0f6305f7e7dfd8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Athenara Wong","original_name":"Athenara Wong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62b19ec0f1b571055fb4173a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Tsz-Ho","original_name":"Wong Tsz-Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62b19ee4eb09320063ccb243","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Wan-sze","original_name":"Wong Wan-sze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b19efa9c24fc0061b2f581","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596592,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wong Wan-sze","original_name":"Wong Wan-sze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b19f0390cf51008d4f3fc1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596593,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wong Wan-sze","original_name":"Wong Wan-sze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b19f0977b1fb043c4b0f3d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/aWcpSHLJnCBVxLxsAR7psKgDylA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1419}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"16th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
