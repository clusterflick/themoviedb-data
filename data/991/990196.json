Chronicle of a fragmented childhood between two countries, memory shredded by separation and abandonment. Chronicle also of the return, of a country broken by the central power (the demonstrations of the region of Tizi Ouzou in particular made tens of deaths), loneliness of the women and the children who fight each day for their survival. This is my family trajectory but it is above all that of a country with \"murderous power\" as all Kabyle children and adults sing.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/rUxUPHzMonpDGTVHI0feJMZfXyG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K (Il est une fois)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1668826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédérique Devaux","original_name":"Frédérique Devaux","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/AnE42MyouSJemHvSCu8cc9fCJmB.jpg","credit_id":"62b0f3575a5ed000626fe723","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUxUPHzMonpDGTVHI0feJMZfXyG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
