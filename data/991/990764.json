Relief is however short-lived. As time passes, nostalgia and loneliness creep upon the exiled youth. Decem remains trapped in recurrent nightmares of the past and continues to plunge into despair, living with a constant sense of peril. The challenges of living in the forest along with the wildfire in the mountains eventually make him reconsider the path ahead. Mirroring the disturbed youth’s inner turmoil with the sinister wild nature, the psychological drama relates the tormented state of the exiled body and soul.","popularity":0.0842,"poster_path":"/1jMD8E1i35l3Jz0pKdq8jpcw1Yn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trek of an Extinct Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3102289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chung Suet-Ying","original_name":"鍾雪瑩","popularity":0.2785,"profile_path":"/kAWBcYbbOYe0u1s5bAjVKasUYs2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62b2bd99a24c50047bd78d8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3597763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Cheung","original_name":"Shin Cheung","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62b2bdb853f8330092eafd95","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597765,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gloria Ho Lok-yee","original_name":"Gloria Ho Lok-yee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b2bdd705f9cf00ef110e3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Ho Lok-yee","original_name":"Gloria Ho Lok-yee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b2bdcb05f9cf00f0bbc97d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yung Tsz Hong","original_name":"Yung Tsz-Hung","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66de166b47b546e368787ed8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/1jMD8E1i35l3Jz0pKdq8jpcw1Yn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1423}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"16th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
