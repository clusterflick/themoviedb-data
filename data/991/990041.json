A recent move back to its edges sees Benson re-imagining the arid climate's texture of feldspar, sand, creosote and deep skies with layers of no-input feedback, digital paint, misbehaving color effects and camera-driven image distortion. Shot in one long take using custom real-time video software, \"Deserted\" places a geological history within a context both synthesized and electronic to its core.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/6UfSEvoLGrhfOrYPateNN2d3beM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deserted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Benson","original_name":"Andrew Benson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0b7d072c13e006267e218","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Benson","original_name":"Andrew Benson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0b7c5c14fee008deed855","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":871,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6UfSEvoLGrhfOrYPateNN2d3beM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
