The humble gesture of these artisans, stooped over the pavement, morphs into a confrontation with the hubristic act of monument building. For the artistâ€™s brother, the struggle to regain the use of his hands after a serious injury transforms into a narrative about agency in the face of being forgotten, marginalized and deemed of no importance. An out-of-print photography book on Portuguese stone pavements leads to a series of improbable connections. A tour of a neurobiology lab leads to an examination of a Cold War re-education camp where prisoners were forced to dig up stones to create replicas of antiquity while covertly drawing on stone shards to mark and then bury a trace of their stories. In Quarries, Ga extracts stories of resistance from unlikely places and on overlooked surfaces.  - https://bureau-inc.com","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gcZSPC1vhusGklTXBDU0yh1NZVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quarries","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellie Ga","original_name":"Ellie Ga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b1d359bf0f6305f6f8f08e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2410075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellie Ga","original_name":"Ellie Ga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b1d34e9638640476ede0eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21282292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcZSPC1vhusGklTXBDU0yh1NZVt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
