It will last Jacopo’s lifetime. Jacopo Baboni Schilingi wears a special device conceived to measure his breathing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, based on technology developed by David Kuller (through his company My Air). A dedicated computer and algorithm constantly monitor the incoming data: the length of Jacopo’s breaths, total volume of his last 10 seconds to 1 minute of breathing, breath rate, rib cage expansion and compression, etc. The data transmitted and interpreted live from the device, creates a symbiosis between technology and the most fundamental, intimate process of a human’s life: breathing. For the first time, this device allows us to witness and comprehend an existential version of the present. Converting this into semantic functions, it generates endless music.","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":"/lskDdY8qTEnAnXYRJYhidmPPDWe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Argo","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3595760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacopo Baboni Schilingi","original_name":"Jacopo Baboni Schilingi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0b9c26beaea0092f03bcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":949,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lskDdY8qTEnAnXYRJYhidmPPDWe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
