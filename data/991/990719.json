Creators of a Productive Landscape","overview":"In the highlands of Tigray - northern Ethiopia - on the edge of the escarpment that descends steeply to the Danakil dessert, Hagos Mashisho and Desta Gidey have toiled and struggled for years to turn the rugged slopes of the East African Rift Valley into fertile ground. They have grown crops here not only to feed themselves and their family, but also to share with others, in particular the pilgrims who regularly pass by on their way to the monastery of Gundagundo. Touched by the kindness of their hosts, the pilgrims have given them the biblical names \"Abraham\" and \"Sarah\". The film explores the work ethos and grace of these Tigrean farmers: the cheerful mood with which they do what needs to be done; the devotedness to the tasks at hand; the coordinated movements of humans and animals as they work when ploughing, sowing, harvesting, threshing; - and finally those moments of invocation when the dependence on nature and the transcendent are acknowledged.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/wQgrba8JRR2ql5Il9JEzXMOF5Wj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abraham and Sarah.
