At the very height of the Cold War, with American schoolchildren practicing duck-and-cover drills, the man who Americans feared could incinerate them in a rain of hydrogen bombs arrived in Washington, D.C. at the invitation of President Eisenhower. For both men, the visit was an opportunity to halt the escalating threats of the Cold War and chart a new course toward peaceful coexistence. For the American press, it was the media blockbuster story of the year.","popularity":0.4657,"poster_path":"/br5WakanHjA1HU3wvvZNgsCorxL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":18720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Stone Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":85750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sundial Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kruschev's Great American Tour","title":"Cold War Roadshow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Experience: Cold War Roadshow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cold War Roadshow: American Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cold War Roadshow (American Experience)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Khrushchev","original_name":"Никита Хрущёв","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/9sftYdKvvJgQePPsTkBJLVTap3m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"62b0fa8e96386400619c1ff0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Stone","original_name":"Robert Stone","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/e1nqgNLyPbHOIk0F5fq9ACXWGNh.jpg","credit_id":"62b0fb2feb09320051221879","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Toidze","original_name":"Tim Toidze","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0fb4572c13e008c5ffc59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Stone","original_name":"Robert Stone","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/e1nqgNLyPbHOIk0F5fq9ACXWGNh.jpg","credit_id":"62b0fb753cd12c00932c98d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27808,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luc Martin-Gousset","original_name":"Luc Martin-Gousset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b0fb64c58acd00511cf1d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Stone","original_name":"Robert Stone","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/e1nqgNLyPbHOIk0F5fq9ACXWGNh.jpg","credit_id":"64a9a99c9c97bd00adea564a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051611,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gary Lionelli","original_name":"Gary Lionelli","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a9d63e2ec800cbcd5110","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Stone","original_name":"Robert Stone","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/e1nqgNLyPbHOIk0F5fq9ACXWGNh.jpg","credit_id":"64a9a9b89c97bd00adea5656","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Toidze","original_name":"Tim Toidze","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a9c13e2ec800cbcd50f9","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2632229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Reuter","original_name":"Paul Reuter","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a9cb66a0d300c66e1240","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Toidze","original_name":"Tim Toidze","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a9a9a966a0d300c66e1226","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3474774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5aHIq5w57oQkLwkQTOiphv6RMAs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1479,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/br5WakanHjA1HU3wvvZNgsCorxL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":986}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":225223,"name":"american experience"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2014-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PBS \"American Experience\"","release_date":"2014-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
