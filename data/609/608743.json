It is a martial art. It is more valued for money transactions. Every year, the door singer will gather a world-class treasure to hold a 'fireworks meeting'.  The fireworks exhibition held a three-day auction. There are thousands of jade Guanyin and other imaginary things, so every year, many rivers and lakes and wealthy businessmen come to the auction. However, this year's fireworks show was particularly sensational, because the martial arts goddess 'soul knife' that has been silent for hundreds of years has appeared in the 'Fireworks Festival'.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/p98LYULXxTDRk0L5XhEPKQjEhAZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soul Knife","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wu Lin: The Soul Knife","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wu Lin: Huang Hun Dao","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zea Min","original_name":"Zea Min","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62935afbd48cee4e24ae801c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deric Wan Siu-Lun","original_name":"温兆伦","popularity":0.791,"profile_path":"/sR0ei9NPJETW4wWJxq3kO4b0fW8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62935b035a4690009e4a0262","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2748214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ren Yingjian","original_name":"Ren Yingjian","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/nweXltUqxybAzfLN9M8e2FACncC.jpg","credit_id":"62935aee09ed8f12554d55ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fdbWPgbSfkz1yzlAy2Celu0hdcb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p98LYULXxTDRk0L5XhEPKQjEhAZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AqLEMchursIsOA9bpcEj1yTCTbJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
