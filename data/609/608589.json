Each story, reconstructed by the artist from 3D animation sequences culled from news sources online, plays on two monitors, with each pair at a 90-degree angle. The artist exposes the fine line between official history and myth making in one of the biggest news stories of the post 9-11 era, which triggered reactions and conspiracy theories worldwide. The work also contemplates the ways storytelling and video editing can serve as means to steer away from or approximate to the truth.\" - Microscope Gallery","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/xAqahCkJJTS7dVWDvuk7O9T4MnH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re: The Operation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peggy Ahwesh","original_name":"Peggy Ahwesh","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/2PpqxpTqv2HN5yQMusOQCcZly4l.jpg","credit_id":"5d02479b0e0a26134ac9975b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xAqahCkJJTS7dVWDvuk7O9T4MnH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
