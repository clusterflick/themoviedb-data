To do so, they first lure the banker from his home, then have a trunk containing one of the gang delivered there, where it is taken into the daughtersâ€™ dressing-room. One daughter, at her mirror, sees the trunk begin to open, and, using her small cousin as a messenger, warns her sister of their danger.
