Years later, the husband struggles against the ravages of tuberculosis to support his wife and daughter. The heroine’s father has become a miser, and around the time of the husband’s death he unwittingly moves into a cheap flat directly above that of his widowed daughter and her child.

Her faith touchs the father, and he reconciles with his daughter.","popularity":0.1913,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Child's Faith","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0509c1c3a36832f21f20ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Barker","original_name":"Florence Barker","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/9UBRj7K9xRDyGkNvGxE8Jdwv22S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0509c80e0a267fa9caf703","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nichols","original_name":"George Nichols","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/ghGlmpjdUDRShrGZyG92sm3m5Hx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0509cfc3a3684adb28eb18","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
