There, local white settlers — a couple and their young daughter — befriend the child and give her a doll, her first and only toy. Meanwhile, another tribesman is wantonly killed by a settler. Enraged, the Indians plan revenge and organize a war-party to attack the town. The Indians also take from the child the doll she was given and smash it. The child mourns her broken doll, and buries it with traditional tribal rites. Alarmed that her new friends will be harmed when the town is attacked, the child rushes ahead of the war-party to give warning of the imminent attack. In the raid the child is struck by a bullet, and makes her painful way to her doll’s burial site. Alone, she dies.","popularity":0.3784,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Broken Doll","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1119397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Egan","original_name":"Gladys Egan","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/vOTrPoS99wnuACgIOED2vF6FMXv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0517e3c3a368489e234c15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0517e992514117b4bd8ac3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0517f10e0a261357ce7091","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
