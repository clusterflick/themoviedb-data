Raju, Bini, Rai, Bhaskar, Tista, Suman and Sabir come from very different socio-economic backgrounds. Yet, there are certain interconnecting issues of social acceptance and finding a space in the largely hetero-normative social order in each of these diaries which reflect the larger image of how politics of power operate.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tm2rgLmTSLFv1pGbHBpJRlCfwy2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diaries of Transformation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anirban Ghosh","original_name":"Anirban Ghosh","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d05627b0e0a261357ceff50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2111294","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tm2rgLmTSLFv1pGbHBpJRlCfwy2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
