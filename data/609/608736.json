The music on this recording was composed and arranged by Mark Isham for the Windham Hill video, Tibet. It provides a look at the place called the “Roof of the World,” where the heavens and the earth meet, and where centuries old rhythms continue. It is a brief glimpse of vast stretches of empty, high plains and snowcapped peaks. The monasteries and the monks who live there are the last of an ever diminishing religious culture which has no parallel in the West.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/zywLWpwFfAhRZpoWMHqDI4pMkQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windham Hill: Tibet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Isham","original_name":"Mark Isham","popularity":0.4789,"profile_path":"/ayQ1j1T3wFk44kliy1u4atTT8um.jpg","credit_id":"669ec589e43be790afdd89c7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130906,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tom McQuade","original_name":"Tom McQuade","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035a769251411a82c6d90d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865424,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Emmons","original_name":"Kevin Emmons","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035af39251416876bb9e6d","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Yen","original_name":"Ann Yen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035aa00e0a26615bcc5a16","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Blaisdell","original_name":"Allen Blaisdell","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035ab592514162bcbffaeb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891925,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dann Moss","original_name":"Dann Moss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0359da0e0a26615bcc590d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Dorfman","original_name":"Stanley Dorfman","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0359e90e0a260b0acbdc66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337613,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Robinson","original_name":"Anne Robinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035a4dc3a36818f420a021","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martha Lipscomb","original_name":"Martha Lipscomb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035a94c3a3684adb25fa31","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891925,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dann Moss","original_name":"Dann Moss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035ada0e0a261fbbd31f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Second Unit Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337611,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Riva","original_name":"Jenny Riva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035b060e0a263f96d19444","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Hurley","original_name":"Susan Hurley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035b3a9251413a9bb8c13d","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fritz Kasten","original_name":"Fritz Kasten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d035a0a9251416876bb9dc5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fulton","original_name":"Robert Fulton","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/dyzMR7dtY5fyoyccAVfcoiqN4np.jpg","credit_id":"5d035ac2c3a3686230262aa4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zywLWpwFfAhRZpoWMHqDI4pMkQH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
