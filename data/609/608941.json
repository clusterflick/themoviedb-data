Mrs. Randall entertains the local minister, while Mr. Randall agrees to take his daughter on a walk along the beach. However, he is attracted by a flirtatious young woman, and the little girl wanders off on her own. She clambers onto a seaside rock where she falls asleep, unmindful of the incoming tide. Her parents at last notice her absence and begin searching for her. However, the incoming tide has by this time surrounded her rock, cutting her off from land. A lifeguard hears her cries and swims to the rescue just as the rising tide is about to engulf her. The child is returned to her parents, who receive from their near tragedy a salutary lesson in the importance of being more careful parents.","popularity":0.3565,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Salutary Lesson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d051334925141131bb98bbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Longfellow","original_name":"Stephanie Longfellow","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/tdSFxlw9VyxWEEGj25Hof0AcuT1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d05133c9251413f2dbb8f34","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1119397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Egan","original_name":"Gladys Egan","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/vOTrPoS99wnuACgIOED2vF6FMXv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d051344c3a368489e2344eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeanie Macpherson","original_name":"Jeanie Macpherson","popularity":0.2195,"profile_path":"/nulmuZe4m0edGINH1Me5ix0Ivsl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Friend","credit_id":"5fdfcd9ece997a0042010199","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Craig","original_name":"Charles Craig","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Wife's Visitor","credit_id":"5fdfcdb079b3d4003e2d1cc9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Prescott","original_name":"Vivian Prescott","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pDIyP1EYqpOBjqNt7phMQz8WpgO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Woman on the Beach","credit_id":"5fdfcdc0fb3f61003e698c50","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Rescuer","credit_id":"5fdfcdd15545ca0040ddcc95","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Toncray","original_name":"Kate Toncray","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/qb3ty4jC8UdZrvwjVHIilGjY4kr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Maid","credit_id":"5fdfcde6e263bb0046beb545","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5fdfcdf15b370d003e4359ea","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
