It was the 24th edition of the Dutch music festival Pinkpop and the 6th in Landgraaf. There were around 64,300 spectators. During the performance of Thelonious Monster, singer Bob Forrest climbed through one of the songs through the loudspeaker towers to sit on the roof of the main stage as an inanimate person. He was then talked down and continued the performance.  During the closing act of the festival, the performance of The Black Crowes , the power went out making it almost dark on the site for about ten minutes. The audience reacted laconically to this pause by loudly singing Monty Python's 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life'. The Black Crowes were forced to stop their performance but when the power failure was over they came back on stage to complete the performances.","popularity":0.557,"poster_path":"/wTlvQ6eu07TkeCUAOpU5hkGEK9L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rage Against The Machine: Pinkpop Festival","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenny Kravitz","original_name":"Lenny Kravitz","popularity":1.6148,"profile_path":"/pIoGuEUax5aeH3PKuaYK9wKEeoj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02b71492514173ecc03bf5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettie Serves","original_name":"Bettie Serves","popularity":0.0494,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02b746c3a368431e1f0179","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelonious Monster","original_name":"Thelonious Monster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d02b74fc3a368445b26c849","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTlvQ6eu07TkeCUAOpU5hkGEK9L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":33474,"name":"band singer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
