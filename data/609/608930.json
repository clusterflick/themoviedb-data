His evenings now free, he takes up with a socialite, but uncomfortable with her social ambition, forgets to attend a dinner party she has thrown in his honor. To atone, he buys her an extravagant diamond pin, but before he can deliver it he sees an old suitor leaving his wifeâ€™s side of the apartment. Consumed first by jealousy, then remorse, he discovers he still loves the woman he married. A child next door finds the diamond pin while playing in the Wilson apartment and innocently takes it to Mrs. Wilson. Misreading the attached note, Mrs. Wilson assumes the pin is meant as a peace offering and takes her husband back.","popularity":0.3446,"poster_path":"/fpQeiFwsHQyOeUfgT4llFCIFyXD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Diamond Star","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Lucas","original_name":"Wilfred Lucas","popularity":0.3261,"profile_path":"/rr70uPoMMtkHFYSPn0JTwI9ikQ9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d050da19251413f2dbb8612","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Barker","original_name":"Florence Barker","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/9UBRj7K9xRDyGkNvGxE8Jdwv22S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d050da8c3a36808701f3349","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Guest at Dinner Party","credit_id":"600595804ca676003f0a7c62","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
