But how did the composer come to develop his unique style? On this video, maestro Francois-Xavier Roth and the London Symphony Orchestra present the UK premiere of a previously lost work by the young Debussy, alongside some of his earliest inspirations. Debussy's newly discovered Premiére Suite gives a rare insight into the mind of a young composer on the cusp of innovation. It's a work filled with Romantic and Eastern influences and glimpses of the unexpected harmonies that came to define Debussy's work. Paired alongside the composer's role models - from Wagner's powerful intertwining motifs, the abundant Spanish influences in Lalo's rarely-heard Cello Concerto performed here by Edgar Moreau, and Massenet's majestic Le Cid - Francois-Xavier Roth gives a fresh perspective on the much-loved composer.","popularity":0.4801,"poster_path":"/oQBwjapS8Gmb1LOFNiBYVaVrRHl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126347,"logo_path":null,"name":"LSO Live","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Symphony Orchestra: The Young Debussy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2479812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Moreau","original_name":"Edgar Moreau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cello","credit_id":"5df022c2f6fd180015ee6928","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2164458,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François-Xavier Roth","original_name":"François-Xavier Roth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5df022d94b0c6300154a3f54","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"London Symphony Orchestra","original_name":"London Symphony Orchestra","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff26a1a0c4c16003fa66bde","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corentin Leconte","original_name":"Corentin Leconte","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/cn0ds6eV2AffuZNfTpdjlY1ceOD.jpg","credit_id":"5df023286a34480018c71cef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ZjTU7zMdR3i6JskvvgjAKnWTU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQQHqHmmzYXCQ27kMN458EkMNqB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oQBwjapS8Gmb1LOFNiBYVaVrRHl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Debussy: Première Suite d'Orchestre, I.
