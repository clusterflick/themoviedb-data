It tells a story everyone can interpret in their own way, based on their own experience. There is no imposition, only suggestions. I wanted to share my biggest pain in this life with this film.

I dedicate this film to all the women of the world.","popularity":0.1902,"poster_path":"/vcEhD84SCXXWz67wbGzj333nhVv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Engloutis","origin_country":""},{"id":123422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spark Seeker","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AMA","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julie Gautier","original_name":"Julie Gautier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/u3RzhC7W8KTthXBumESl76U2Tb9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64533317c04429010161abff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julie Gautier","original_name":"Julie Gautier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/u3RzhC7W8KTthXBumESl76U2Tb9.jpg","credit_id":"6453332c091e62016530fb81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326746,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jérôme Lozano","original_name":"Jérôme Lozano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d055c050e0a267f2fcb911a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380463,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nassim El Mounabbih","original_name":"Nassim El Mounabbih","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d055c48c3a36832f21fb0c1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338694,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gregory Lanfranchi","original_name":"Gregory Lanfranchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d055c76c3a36877db1faf2f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326745,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Ballard","original_name":"Jacques Ballard","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/11NhklFt6YdPWwxLny0bK5MDnxh.jpg","credit_id":"5d055bca0e0a260eddcb858d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326745,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Ballard","original_name":"Jacques Ballard","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/11NhklFt6YdPWwxLny0bK5MDnxh.jpg","credit_id":"5d055be292514163d1bdeee7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julie Gautier","original_name":"Julie Gautier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/u3RzhC7W8KTthXBumESl76U2Tb9.jpg","credit_id":"5d8c9d5babf8e20029797cc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8116276","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8338Tl5hQNeQanrJS2hQHxaenkh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6FneexQYvUZawx6k76LuCfxQIEn.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.407,"height":300,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/2yGRkiG2G9B7Wex64oC0ZNXhSnO.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":422}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vcEhD84SCXXWz67wbGzj333nhVv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nu2Ql2jcSE8AvPsSsdWP5VhJWmV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"AMA - a short film by Julie Gautier","key":"bdBuDg7mrT8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-09T15:28:27.000Z","id":"5d055ceb0e0a26333ad4ebec"}]}}}
