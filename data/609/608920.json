Over her husband’s shoulder, the wife reads a letter from the dancer, with the telltale salutation \"My dear boy\", and threatens to poison herself if he goes. To show that he is not to be deterred by such a melodramatic trick, Avery takes the vial and pours the poison into a wine glass, saying if she decides to do this, why not do it with style? He then leaves, but not without misgivings. At the party the dancer offers him wine in a glass which looks exactly like the one he had handed to his suicidal spouse. This triggers an attack of conscience, and Avery rushes home, to find his wife in a swoon which he takes for her threat fulfilled. Madly, he bursts into the dancer’s party, confesses assisted suicide, and dies.","popularity":0.153,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Impalement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Powell","original_name":"Frank Powell","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/204pUG69Va4HRbuReZ21IEVxWMV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d05059f0e0a26333ad457f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Barker","original_name":"Florence Barker","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/9UBRj7K9xRDyGkNvGxE8Jdwv22S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0505a6c3a36877db1f1754","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Craig","original_name":"Charles Craig","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0505b2c3a36808701f253e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
