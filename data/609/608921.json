He is presented with a commemorative stein to mark the occasion. Ralph meets an artist’s model, marries her over his father’s objections, and is disowned by the old man. Eventually, he becomes a drunkard and deserts his wife and their baby, who is taken in by Ralph’s father when the young mother dies. The grandson is raised with the same advantages as his father, graduates from the same university, and is admitted to the same club. During the festivities, Ralph stumbles by the club, is seen through the window by his son and his friends, and is brought inside. He attempts to drink from his old stein, but is shoved aside by the boy, who does not know him. The old man enters and recognizes Ralph. All three are reconciled as Ralph dies.","popularity":0.1768,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Face at the Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verner Clarges","original_name":"Verner Clarges","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/uQ4vVt4fT8gAjp60AIrdBuYdEZw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0506d80e0a267fa9caf277","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
