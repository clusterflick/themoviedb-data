With a sordid history of sexual and physical abuse, and having been caught in the arms of her female lover by her wealthy, overbearing mother, Val is forced to make a choice: to live a 'normal' life, or be forever cut off - financially and emotionally. She concedes to her mother's ultimatum, and pursues a heterosexual relationship to appease her, only to catch her new boyfriend in bed with another man. Her inability to cope with her life triggers her repressed male alter-ego to emerge and take over.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/buxSmYhd5hb5nOgCgAYy15cnF9k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Val/Val","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Camelot","original_name":"Gustavo Camelot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d00a8280e0a26333acd2b44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0452889","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/buxSmYhd5hb5nOgCgAYy15cnF9k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
