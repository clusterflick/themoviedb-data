Later, as a laundryman in a California mining town, Charlie is tormented by local men but is finally befriended by a young woman and her cowboy sweetheart. One of Charlie’s tormentors is a well-dressed idler and, secretly, a bandit who robs the mail. The cowboy and the bandit become rivals for the girl’s affections. Suspicious of the bandit, Charlie follows him, observes him robbing a mail-carrier, and contrives to capture him, cutting off his pigtail to bind the bandit. Rewarded for the bandit’s capture, but disgraced in his own eyes for dishonouring his family, Charlie gives the cash reward to the young couple and surreptitiously leaves Golden Gulch.","popularity":0.5609,"poster_path":"/miQ5VfS9KS20jcRHATMWvk6R1Qm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Chink at Golden Gulch","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony O'Sullivan","original_name":"Anthony O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d0517249251416876be3b24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.
