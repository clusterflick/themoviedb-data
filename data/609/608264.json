Jonás Godesberg, a man who looks amazingly like Luis Eduardo Aute, dictates his memoirs to a computer. He tells the story of how his grandfather, German scientist Gustav Godesberg, who developed genetic engineering experiments for the Nazis during World War II, arrived to the Spanish coast after surviving a ship wreck, and there fell for Amalia, a prostitute nicknamed 'The German'. Together, they developed a business out of selling babies that had been genetically modified to look like whoever the buyer wanted them to.","popularity":0.134,"poster_path":"/rXQRy9BhMdpTXJzERDVjfkbCTYL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerio de Cultura","origin_country":""},{"id":206815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gobierno del Principado de Asturias","origin_country":""},{"id":206816,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ayuntamiento de Avilés","origin_country":""},{"id":206817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joaquín Mario Menéndez García P.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El vivo retrato","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Vera","original_name":"Victoria Vera","popularity":0.2202,"profile_path":"/wxHoVNPGgcWuSVGiyAqlLpO2InJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amalia 'La Alemana'","credit_id":"61eebefecd20460092380027","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Loyola","original_name":"Javier Loyola","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/pfwB4NZB1bRRIUWusE0spin191r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61eebf14d11e0e00957d19e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Taylor","original_name":"Jack Taylor","popularity":0.3351,"profile_path":"/bTqdz2PeN9bPN3y6pvFehBAKTAI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Profesor Roger Springer","credit_id":"64e4ccd61feac10138d87d83","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3576912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Prittwitz","original_name":"Andreas Prittwitz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gustav Godesberg","credit_id":"64e4cd1d06f984012d70ca9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"César Sánchez","original_name":"César Sánchez","popularity":0.0781,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sindo","credit_id":"64e4cd615258ae010bd7c0d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paco Hernández","original_name":"Paco Hernández","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64e4cd79c613ce00ac3ffa87","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":581681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Elena Flores","original_name":"María Elena Flores","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/51I1Tss32alGGP2tsSohZC7TsMa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ites","credit_id":"64e4cd9be0ca7f013a9849e5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fran Vaquero","original_name":"Fran Vaquero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e4ce8fc3c89100aed770b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francisco G.
