The film stars Rajkumar, Leelavati and Balkrishna in lead roles. The film had a musical score by G.K. Venkatesh. Actress Sridevi essayed the role of Muktha Bai (as a child artist), thereby the latter making her Kannada film debut. The movie is based on the life of Gora Kumbhar, a potter turned into a saint who lived in the 13th and 14th centuries in Teredoki village. He supposedly lost his child while curing the clay by his legs for making pots, because he did not notice his child fumbling under his feet as he immersed himself in chanting the name of God. He was called Saint Gora Kumbara by the people of Maharashtra.","popularity":0.2492,"poster_path":"/ly9x9aR0fBmZxyCZX6EJutkeblM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lakshmi Films Combines","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1974-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bhaktha Kumbara","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Rajkumar","original_name":"Dr. Rajkumar","popularity":0.5465,"profile_path":"/5Gzd8OnJS0DIoYLW7tZOCd8NbCC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gora","credit_id":"63c1a297e16e5a008192242f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leelavathi","original_name":"Leelavathi","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/jrZfjaNOjEHROa8hdxJythfhjkE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gora's wife","credit_id":"63c1a2ad23be460098094321","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4653073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manjula","original_name":"Manjula","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/oysE8FvPwt86TBtOxHOntlQcvuf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gora's Sister in law","credit_id":"6707b78fc92c2e56d8615269","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
