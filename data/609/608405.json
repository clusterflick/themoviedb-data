These words and images were printed directly onto 35mm clear film stock at eminent letterpress studios in North America: the Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum in Two Rivers, the Center for Book and Paper Arts in Chicago, the Hatch Show Print in Nashville and the Musée de l’imprimerie du Québec & Lovell Litho in Montréal. Judith Poirier printed 1,643 feet of film to produce her abstract western and her technique of printing onto celluloid creates a unique texture on screen, as well as generating an original soundtrack. Setting West reinterprets a classic cinematic genre while exploring a formative period in the history of typography and printing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jadGztpIgLGGDBiaLXkwDdKLctc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Setting West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Poirier","original_name":"Judith Poirier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0131b20e0a262e88c9b993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.643,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jadGztpIgLGGDBiaLXkwDdKLctc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":965}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
