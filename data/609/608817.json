It's amazing, even 3 hours ago he was hotly arguing with the film's director Abram Room, how to play the key scene of the film \"Strict Young Man\"! The damned phrase about suffering and mercy did not work out in any way... Mercy and justice, now Dmitry Konsovsky will have to rely only on them. Yesterday he was the leading actor of the studio \"Mezhrabpom-film\", who has a dozen films on his account, the performer of the main role in the new film \"Strict Young Man\", an artist of the Vakhtangov Theater, today he is a prisoner of the Butyrskaya prison. His brother, the artist Alexey Konsovsky, died in 1991, but he could not get permission to get acquainted with his brother's investigative case, did not find out what his last words were. Now, 70 years later, Alexey Konsovsky's grandson, Nikolai Vershinin-Konsovsky, will tell us about all the dramatic events.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9AyXg3qVpN5Gu75k922YOOYfbhP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100714,"logo_path":"/eM5jbitlbQsiCDCJInbb0Lo3ve7.png","name":"Example of Intonation","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":3451,"logo_path":"/53lT8VOQ9JDiPGYLvjgO42Av58I.png","name":"Art Pictures Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Komsomolets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4023169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Vershinin-Konsovsky","original_name":"Nikolay Vershinin-Konsovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6443cb12d35dea0481fb97cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4023168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Gnilorybov","original_name":"Pavel Gnilorybov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6443caf2cee2f602fb36a90e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2082241,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Svetlana Arsenyeva","original_name":"Svetlana Arsenyeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443cb88a06efe05c4a48de4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961529,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Barkhvart","original_name":"Ivan Barkhvart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443cb61651fcf04889d2f19","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1997171,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yuliya Galochkina","original_name":"Юлия Галочкина","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/4mvBiZY6RlQSyTHgZkTInQ4Y54e.jpg","credit_id":"6443cb76d35dea0455fb965a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2037460,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolay Yankin","original_name":"Nikolay Yankin","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6443cbd4d35dea02fcfb8fe7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Bulgakova","original_name":"Anna Bulgakova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d041dad0e0a26134acc8946","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1670,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9AyXg3qVpN5Gu75k922YOOYfbhP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
