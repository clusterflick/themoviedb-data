Mikey luckily bumped into two 'surrogate grand-parents', retired juvenile court judge Antoine and colonel's widow Blandine, whose children emigrated to Australia. A school gang presses Mikey to steal at home as 'hazing test'. Helping Mikey brings the lonely pair together. Things get complicated when Mikey stops at nothing to press the substitutes to present him to Bob's parents Bertrand and Marguerite, who own a castle but disowned their own son just for being gay.","popularity":0.3446,"poster_path":"/eubkGGJ7x72PbpU8Xqs46aHwBxB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une famille pas comme les autres","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2608394,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janine Boissard","original_name":"Janine Boissard","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tSvfl5ZYQSPjFoYgI5WgiMIQDXi.jpg","credit_id":"646381b0a6725400e3d328e6","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1763504,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Catherine Ramberg","original_name":"Catherine Ramberg","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646381b60f365500fcdfea91","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michel Boucau","original_name":"Michel Boucau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646381ccdbbb420119f64a0a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361955,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Leduc","original_name":"Anne Leduc","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646381dbdbbb4200fc891129","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510561,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Luc Azoulay","original_name":"Jean-Luc Azoulay","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/lABKfACDsXiGBiiKxDj30D7SCl3.jpg","credit_id":"646381e50f365500e20cbf04","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868175,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominique Janne","original_name":"Dominique Janne","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646381f0ef8b3200fe7e9996","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Pierre Dusséaux","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dusséaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646381fa8c44b9780af28eff","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2369319,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Linda Naud","original_name":"Linda Naud","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646382010f36550153c7d3f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108059,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Virginie Saint-Martin","original_name":"Virginie Saint-Martin","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64638216a672540185895a52","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Édouard Molinaro","original_name":"Édouard Molinaro","popularity":0.1714,"profile_path":"/i0TSDPTyO2ZUFE1Ornrp5ioV8Pw.jpg","credit_id":"5d0085510e0a261377c9db11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0433036","wikidata_id":"Q16681880","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eubkGGJ7x72PbpU8Xqs46aHwBxB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
