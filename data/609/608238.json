Her country attire merely amuses the stage managers, but Tom Gatesby, a backer, persuades Bozoni, a cabaret owner, to give her a job. She innocently accepts money from Bozoni to furnish a luxury apartment; and when disillusioned Bozoni cancels the payments for her furniture and new clothes, Bee tries to avoid the gown-collectors, but they retrieve her gown and fur coat. In desperation, she joins a revue chorus, doing a lingerie number that results in a fight with Valentia, the star of the show. Tom rescues Bee from her precarious position, and all ends happily.","popularity":0.1801,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A roaring mirth-twister to blow your woes away!","title":"Uneasy Payments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Tudo a Prestações","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"裸で御披露","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Primeiro Prêmio de Charleston","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberta Vaughn","original_name":"Alberta Vaughn","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/h2U2wgyC4rnoKMH2PpzYtlbtg8Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bee Haven","credit_id":"5d001212c3a368623020670b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Luden","original_name":"Jack Luden","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/9ukRIpNdfkURQg6jeCGqCcUHBiT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Gatesby","credit_id":"5d00121a92514142cabc3676","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gino Corrado","original_name":"Gino Corrado","popularity":0.2657,"profile_path":"/f4FxGEcWMoRcBbArEvYCxy7QSk7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bozoni","credit_id":"5d0012200e0a26040ece554c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Potel","original_name":"Victor Potel","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/obZCOU7xnxvlkLLfHtlZPs3EB3Q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Press Agent","credit_id":"5d00122e0e0a263f96cc5262","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1066900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Francisco","original_name":"Betty Francisco","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/sf3OAMqRQGHSnNLSUMaCRQNJmqW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie Valentia","credit_id":"5d001234c3a3680e92224096","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Stone","original_name":"Gene Stone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Charlie Ross","credit_id":"5d00122792514148a7ba9aff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Norman","original_name":"Amber Norman","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"5d00123d0e0a26040ece557a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kirkland","original_name":"David Kirkland","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/m35nKfyygGi382iDXcOCfIPZLnx.jpg","credit_id":"5d00124ac3a3684f1b2060cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231234,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles P.
