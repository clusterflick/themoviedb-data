Double-projection imagery of the aerial shots of this landscape — at times forming abstract and stereoscope-like compositions — become close-ups on grotesque monuments and sculptures as the camera descends to ground level. Additionally, two iPads both contained within glass domes each play a video of one of two houses that sit directly opposite each other in a residential Topeka neighborhood. One is the headquarters of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church with its anti-LGBTQ signs and other hate-filled rhetoric; the second is the “Equality House”, which was formed later as a direct response, with its rainbow colors and messages of peace and acceptance.\" - Microscope Gallery","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/2zWQTVPgNUCDDbWlTMa4tMY7wQK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kansas Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peggy Ahwesh","original_name":"Peggy Ahwesh","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/2PpqxpTqv2HN5yQMusOQCcZly4l.jpg","credit_id":"5d024ca40e0a261fbbd17346","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2zWQTVPgNUCDDbWlTMa4tMY7wQK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (New York Film Festival)","release_date":"2019-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
