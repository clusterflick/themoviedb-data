Years pass, Aruz finds his missing son, and Grandpa Gorgud names him Basat. Tepegoz, who has already grown up and finished painting, starts eating people one day. When the people found out about this, they kicked Tepagöz out of the village. After Tepagoz's mother, the fairy, bathed him in the lake of Kir, he is no longer affected by weapons, and Tepagoz made a condition in front of the people that they should bring one man and 500 sheep every day. If not, he will raze the whole place to the ground. Seeing that Oban is in such a difficult situation, Dede Gorgud says, \"Basat is the only solution.\" As a result of the dream he saw, Basat, who returned from his trip incomplete, tricks Tepegoz and defeats him and saves the people from trouble.","popularity":0.4118,"poster_path":"/AlgfaWE6dyQFmccjBLNaC6opsej.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Azanfilm","origin_country":"AZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I can't get enough of a person.","title":"Kitabi Dada Gorgud.
