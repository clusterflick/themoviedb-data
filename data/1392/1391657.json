Like many artists, Frank kept diaries and scrapbooks, which provide a window into his interior life. Similarly, the raw footage used in this installation sheds new light on Frank’s artistic process, stitched together by Israel and Bingham in a way that evokes his restless gaze and declamatory voice, at once comical and melancholy. He journeys between his homes in New York and Nova Scotia; the open roads of the United States and Canada; and urban landscapes, including those of Beirut, Cairo, Moscow, and his native Switzerland. Frank makes timeless the most fleeting of pleasures: a warm bath and a steaming tea kettle, a glimpse of his wife June Leaf in her studio, or the play of sunlight on his hand. — Museum of Modern Art","popularity":0.0753,"poster_path":"/lwcpwhu5AgMOteMtmVeb5hhH5RJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"You open the door and you go in and climb out the window and you see something else.","title":"Robert Frank's Scrapbook Footage, 1970–2006","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813314,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Bingham","original_name":"Alex Bingham","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740832b8337acae076dd9b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":910578,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laura Israel","original_name":"Laura Israel","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674083b18337acae076dda09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Frank","original_name":"Robert Frank","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/4UhHEdJhdh3wBhe87ZmPGPahKnY.jpg","credit_id":"674083bf4dfa06b5df92f3dd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jvfQqKjweNyyzbPsEwl3akmabsQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1025,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwcpwhu5AgMOteMtmVeb5hhH5RJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Museum of Modern Art.
