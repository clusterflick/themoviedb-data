The film builds on the collective’s earlier moving image work, such as Chaos Theory (2021) and Hometown (2018), investigating joy, absurdism, truth claims, and childhood—now with Ostashevsky’s poetry as its impetus. The Feeling Sonnets (Transitional Object) follows protagonist Amélie Haest in three roles, responding to Ostashevsky’s verse, in which words, sentences, idioms, and poetic conventions are dislodged and defamiliarized across historical backgrounds and mutual (un)translatability.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/iPzs1oOoQhpXhwEK01u4DKwdM6A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Feeling Sonnets (Transitional Object)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Metahaven","original_name":"Metahaven","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd2e38b4e4c2ef6f77660","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iPzs1oOoQhpXhwEK01u4DKwdM6A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":959}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
