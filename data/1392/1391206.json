The Security Branch of the South African Polic (SAP) regarded Ntombi as a senior ANC member and had classified her as being a feminist. In 1987 Ntombi was kidnapped, interrogated and tortured by the Security Police. Her body was disposed of. It was only 10 years later during the TRC Amnesty application that the family were made aware where Ntombi's bones were buried and finally were able to give her a funeral.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Ntombikayise Kubheka – The Bones of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3433537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enver Samuel","original_name":"Enver Samuel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673f613de50bcc1f2c9e1900","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
