Poor Betsey loses her heart to both of these gentlemen. Betsey tries hard to win the love of these gentlemen, but the harder she tries the less progress she makes. In fact, she gets so tangled up that before long she thinks she \"sees things.\" Bud and Tom try to stake her to each other, for they are both victims of flirting Marian. Tom finally gets Bud to propose to Betsey, misleading him with a phantom legacy. Bud learns the truth of the heiress' real financial position and then leaves her at the altar.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solax Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boarding House Heiress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nearly an Heiress","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1493720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Simpson","original_name":"Fanny Simpson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cxfgdijJAjEs6eJrC0YVRy8Px8i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Betsy Older","credit_id":"673f6e17e50bcc1f2c9e1d24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Quirk","original_name":"Billy Quirk","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/mVRHKE8gPNB3b3BEKIZ1rAj0W4f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Billy Doolittle","credit_id":"673f6e218e1abaf482db78c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darwin Karr","original_name":"Darwin Karr","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/miU21JZlTzhaW7b4cXJ5VjCshWn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Dear","credit_id":"673f6e2ae50bcc1f2c9e1d2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Swayne","original_name":"Marian Swayne","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/mL3K4B1gNFTpBCldmFdKJXxvwK7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Flirting Marian","credit_id":"673f6e36e50bcc1f2c9e1d38","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Beggs","original_name":"Lee Beggs","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/uVblWzHqTbV4OTUXWi3fNbnDrZo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"673f6e3d4dec1f98b29bf103","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0418571","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
