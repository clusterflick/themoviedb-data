Part of a strategy to distance themselves from workers, temporary and sub-contracted work offers little protections and few legal obligations by employers. But these workers do have a voice, and together they are empowering one another to move progress forward. This film was produced in cooperation with Rutgers Professor Dr. Todd Wolfson and his students. It tackles the subject of temp labor and focuses on the New Labor worker center founded in New Brunswick, NJ.","popularity":0.4108,"poster_path":"/tRohLNhDUeEMRxjDI5MwAblqeyE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silent Sea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Somos Maquinas: We Are Not Machines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129832,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Nistico","original_name":"Mark Nistico","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673f5ac7ade9310f3fdfa812","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tRohLNhDUeEMRxjDI5MwAblqeyE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Jersey Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
