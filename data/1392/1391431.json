In this documentary Tibbets co-produced with the Buckeye Aviation Book Company, “Reflections on Hiroshima,” he recounts his memories of the day the atomic bomb was first used in warfare. Tibbets recalls how he became a pilot, and explains how the Manhattan Project’s “Silverplate” program produced a special version of the B-29 capable of delivering the atomic bomb. He also discusses the target selection process and describes the “odd couple” of J. Robert Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves. He remembers seeing the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima and feeling the shock wave of the blast, and shares his views on the role of morality during war.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6dRVHaHLal4oOxZYUiayVhLJLiB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"General Paul Tibbets: Reflections on Hiroshima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3442035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Tibbets","original_name":"Paul Tibbets","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/9OAip3is22sp5L1AXzbYD1AuVsa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"673fcecc5cac041cfae26b55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Kramer","original_name":"Dan Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fceeb5cac041cfae26b8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6dRVHaHLal4oOxZYUiayVhLJLiB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
