When Clemmy is later attacked by Sam Johnson, her father (who does not know the identity of the man who sought to force his attentions on Clemmy) vows that he will force the responsible man to marry her. Clemmy names Avery, and her father proceeds to make plans for a wedding. In the meantime, Clemmy discovers that Avery already has a fianc√©e and, with a change of heart, she runs off, taking refuge on Lover's Island. She makes plans to marry the villainous Sam, but Avery, realizing that he has come to love her, goes to Lover's Island, stops the wedding, and marries Clemmy himself.","popularity":0.2178,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encore Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lover's Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hope Hampton","original_name":"Hope Hampton","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/9gTuym1O8wuOsHPDJfOLVblPu9w.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Clemmy Dawson","credit_id":"6740562e7b825e685b4e1f99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kirkwood","original_name":"James Kirkwood","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/svL7O0IG1wHWXr9BUIolCWkKeeN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jack Avery","credit_id":"6740563a015d2e0f702dfdb9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Wolheim","original_name":"Louis Wolheim","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/unc3IbI5KSZDVRS7o7x6aS8T26e.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Capt.
