Night opens another window in people's inner world. Perhaps the city at night is too mysterious and perhaps the inner world of people is too profound, so we can't get to know all about the city. I have tried to approach her by image to express my feelings and confusions towards her, yet the city in the darkness, despite her trueness, is both blurred to the eye and blurred to the ear. She is very close to our life, but far away from our innermost world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liu Wei","original_name":"Liu Wei","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/syZTlfjeBJp4u5zsBDMqqZSptI9.jpg","credit_id":"6740930af0f2ed8f9851d827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
