The program explores the evolving portrayal of Black characters and narratives in a genre often dominated by exclusionary perspectives, featuring compelling interviews with trailblazers like Octavia Butler, Samuel R. Delany, Mike Sargent, Steven Barnes and Nichelle Nichols. Celebrating the imaginative brilliance of Black sci-fi and fantasy creators, this seeks to examine the complexities of race within said genres as well as the visionary paths these resilient storytellers forge for the future of speculative fiction.","popularity":0.4058,"poster_path":"/zMxwkZPDEB0ar61GtJsv0dwOx7d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144640,"logo_path":"/6kl5tMuct7u3ej5myL4c9QQVSW1.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":161115,"logo_path":"/d1iQlbHJAupXh5oEo4zpRtM09vc.png","name":"BBC TV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The legacy of Black science fiction.","title":"Black Sci-Fi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2948305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Octavia  E.
