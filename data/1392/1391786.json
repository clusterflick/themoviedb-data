Despite public opposition, he passionately promotes cinemaâ€™s educational power. When young filmmaker Omkar decides to document Anand's work, the challenges of delivering quality cinema to these underserved communities become evident. During a screening in a remote village, a sudden power outage leaves the children watching only half of the film. Among them is Ankur, a clever and spirited 9-year-old, who improvises a captivating story based on the incomplete movie. Inspired by Ankur's creativity, Anand and Omkar embark on an unexpected journey that takes them from the villages of India to Hollywood. This journey bridges cultural divides, highlighting the universal impact of cinema and the connection between grassroots efforts and global recognition.","popularity":0.1487,"poster_path":"/zufTB7d1hj8CFNeXn2QP3gNUw9u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cineman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kishore Kadam","original_name":"Kishore Kadam","popularity":0.4828,"profile_path":"/r8r20HPAjcwErxEmxmhxXe7Byi4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6740c3e6f0f2ed8f9851deac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5075481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prithviraj Chavan","original_name":"Prithviraj Chavan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6740c3f35cac041cfae28a04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4551466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siddharth Badi","original_name":"Siddharth Badi","popularity":0.2279,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6740c3fedd53fa0060333c54","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5075486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Umesh Mohan Bagade","original_name":"Umesh Mohan Bagade","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c428dae2e6a938256938","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462875,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sourabh Prabhudesai","original_name":"Sourabh Prabhudesai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c439dd53fa0060333c7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5075489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarita Ganesh Paste","original_name":"Sarita Ganesh Paste","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c472dae2e6a938256958","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zufTB7d1hj8CFNeXn2QP3gNUw9u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
