The movie starts from the playful premise that two undisciplined pedestrians are in charge of the city's traffic. Popovici uses this opportunity to stage an anarchic choreography in the city's centre, the film being closer to an avant-garde study. Just like in The Plant, the director abandons linear dramaturgy and chooses to make a playful exercise, a cinematographic exploration of movement and space.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9n3uzGTdHJxrUShcasfoDuHPEEB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul \"Alexandru Sahia\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How do we follow the rules of the road?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5060183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Slavomir Popovici","original_name":"Slavomir Popovici","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67407862ae12bafff57563c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9n3uzGTdHJxrUShcasfoDuHPEEB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
