Fault Lines follows Leyan’s journey as she makes her way to the United States for medical treatment in the hopes of overcoming a spinal cord injury and walking again on prosthetic legs. Along the way, we witness Leyan’s perseverance, her family’s unwavering love in the wake of her life-changing injury and an intimate portrait of what lies ahead for the child amputees of Gaza.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/ivzDD9X59vziFRJixYaJld0fJYe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All
