The piece explores the move from the 4:3 screen ratio to 16:9, which is now effectively the standard for broadcast television and video. In the construction of New Ratio each colour was assigned a particular tone: white was attributed a standard 1KHz test tone; the pitch of the tone attributed to blue was half that of the test tone; and each of the colours in between (in descending order of luminance) were attributed tones at intervals between these values.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/f8siTgm19YLQPD92rM7fGPM89uF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Ratio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1831021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Payne","original_name":"Simon Payne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fprOxni9CWZ7DA1T1DbTStMnzF0.jpg","credit_id":"5e0c0d9c5541fa00131bc4ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f8siTgm19YLQPD92rM7fGPM89uF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
