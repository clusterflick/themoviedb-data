From a 1910 suffragette demonstration to striking coal miners in the Rhondda Valley, from female CND protesters spanning the Tamar Bridge to the defeat of fascists at London’s Cable Street, this absorbing, illuminating collection examines the nature of protests large and small and for causes regional and national, by participants fighting for suffrage and democracy, against exploitation and inequality, for fair wages and worker’s rights, for public safety, freedom and community and in the face of war and oppression.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain on Film: Protest!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NEW TRAILER - Britain on Film: Protest!","key":"TG6Ij3GG9U0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-14T15:42:08.000Z","id":"5e0ccb6d1511aa0012b22462"}]}}}
