A group of elderly women and men carry plastic lawn chairs across the Mount Herzl National Cemetery in Jerusalem. In the shade of an old pine tree, they sit down, in a circle and discuss matters sublime and elevated. For over two decades, the \"Mt. Herzl Academy has held its weekly meeting at this cemetery. Seated between the graves of the nation's dignitaries, they debate the history of modern philosophy, read poetry, eat lunch and determine the fate of the Jewish nation. Director Tali Shemesh has been following the \"Academy\" for the last 5 years, focusing on two members: Minia, the director's grandmother, and Lena, her great aunt. The film unravels the jagged, intense, almost impossible relationship between these two extremely different women, who each bereaved of the man she loved remain bound together by history and Fate.","popularity":0.2867,"poster_path":"/ed7jxxDIZN5SdbPqkzzBddHfKw8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norma Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2006-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cemetery Club","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Bar","original_name":"Lena Bar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61cc033168b7660060160ac6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minya Rubin","original_name":"Minya Rubin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61cc0339e54d5d00865a51e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tali Shemesh","original_name":"Tali Shemesh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61cc03402efe4e0063f08623","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tali Shemesh","original_name":"Tali Shemesh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc02cd2f1be0001c547523","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tali Shemesh","original_name":"Tali Shemesh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc02d18c22c000a7fe178f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Assaf Amir","original_name":"Assaf Amir","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc02e06840cc001c92846a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2526822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Lavie","original_name":"Guy Lavie","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc02eb41aac4001c8bc6da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159042,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shark De Mayo","original_name":"Shark De Mayo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc02f692e55b005c4f8f0b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1967601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldad Guetta","original_name":"Eldad Guetta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc02fec439c0005f63fd14","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rona Kenan","original_name":"Rona Kenan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc03180cb335001c2ed1a9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234103,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aliza Esquira","original_name":"Aliza Esquira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cc03210cb33500429a059f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0853167","wikidata_id":"Q2410160","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ed7jxxDIZN5SdbPqkzzBddHfKw8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
