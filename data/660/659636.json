The film films the shots of its own accelerated fall, a succession of chromatic shots that cannot be identified either in terms of what is “recorded” in each one (windows, columns, walls, sky or floor) or in its own formal configuration as an image (color, composition, shapes or figures). What is perceived and apprehended is the impotence of vision – of perception – to distinguish this extreme and exhausting mobility, this vertigo of “free fall.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jS9U6HCn2Z0CmzX2gNXLkZhdghg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intento de vuelo fallido","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1802606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Castillo","original_name":"Carlos Castillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1ooKMEI8Vb7kthduVv3x4g95Io6.jpg","credit_id":"5e0bf50312c60400123b23c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jS9U6HCn2Z0CmzX2gNXLkZhdghg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
