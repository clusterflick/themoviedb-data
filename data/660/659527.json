Spoofing on the horror genre, Zebub pokes fun at the clich√©s of slasher flicks, replacing fear with humor. Also featured are works from directors Isabelle Stephen and Shane Morton and a short film about a schizophrenic who finds that the voices in his head are coming from the television.","popularity":0.1368,"poster_path":"/znK8owFVxLcC7e7QrxCEItJa5IJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skits-O-Phrenia","video":true,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895078,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jesse Davidson","original_name":"Jesse Davidson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e0b4ffc9603310014044cf8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie D","original_name":"Debbie D","popularity":0.5512,"profile_path":"/69or5k3y3RUvtCCWbWts5mqgdF8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e0b50069369a2001891a780","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzi Lorraine","original_name":"Suzi Lorraine","popularity":0.277,"profile_path":"/boBZQ40n5sXvbVs4JAo9mzAYkSN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e0b50126082eb0012818200","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2494858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Nolz","original_name":"Sue Nolz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e0b501f1da7a600171aa41a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e0b5038be6d88001301342e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1022810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Tuttle","original_name":"Elaine Tuttle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e0b5046d5dbc20013fd3a02","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"5e0b4f71d5dbc20018fd3575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0460567","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znK8owFVxLcC7e7QrxCEItJa5IJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
