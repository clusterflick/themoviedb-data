The rooms in which they were shot, and the windows they depict, refer back to cameras in two respects: the camera as ‘room’ (and the camera obscura); and the camera that the filmmaker has put to one side. Having hand-cranked the film to expose it, the traces of light, dark and fleeting imagery are a direct, abstract translation of the filmmaker’s gestures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Window / East Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Nightingale","original_name":"Jennifer Nightingale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0c112d1511aa0018afe963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
