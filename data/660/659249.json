Prince originally intended to give this live CD away free with 1,000 copies of Guitar Player magazine in 1994, but he was reportedly barred by Warner Bros. from doing so. A video recording of the performance was released in Europe (on VHS and Laserdisc) with small edits throughout the performance and \"Dolphin\" replaced by the audio track from the official video of the song from The Gold Experience.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7zVDlt4gzSAzNfLD3wVRHs47wNf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Undertaker","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7zVDlt4gzSAzNfLD3wVRHs47wNf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
