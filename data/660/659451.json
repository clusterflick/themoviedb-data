With spending of over $1 billion (in 1945) on cosmetic products, it has evolved into a major commercial enterprise. Packaging has proved to be a very important factor in sales and some $50 million per year is spent on advertising. The FDA look out for harmful products and Federal Trade Commission keeps an eye out for misleading claims. Spas and country resorts, where you can rest and relax, are gaining popularity for those who can afford it as are slenderizing salons and gymnasiums. Hairstyling has become an even bigger business. It's not only women who spend money on beauty products as some $300 million per year is spent by men.","popularity":0.3066,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlene Francis","original_name":"Arlene Francis","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/u6dNWXP49lIf0Sn17tZ9DkcYFP9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5e0ac64666540800113c4572","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Westbrook Van Voorhis","original_name":"Westbrook Van Voorhis","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5e0ac65a896b8f001581a106","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1727482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
