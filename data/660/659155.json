But sometimes you just can't get there. Well, we've got you covered with 8-Bit Symphony @ Home. The atmosphere of a live concert is unmatched - the anticipation, the murmur of the audience, the shiver down the spine... you should go to the concert if you can. But... sometimes you just can't go. And that's where 8-Bit Symphony @ Home comes in, we're giving you a home experience that feels like a concert. The footage from the big screen on your big screen, and top-quality studio versions of the concert arrangements to blast through your speakers. It's not a livestream of the concert. The essence of the concert is the huge sound from a big orchestra and the hypnotic footage on the big screen. A livestream would rob the experience of all of that, with a rubbish sound and blurry video of a screen. But this way, it's like we brought the concert hall to your house.","popularity":0.331,"poster_path":"/3OC88rPMW9eKJcuFwI4Bz6KLKNc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115687,"logo_path":null,"name":"C64Audio.com","origin_country":""},{"id":127057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hull College Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's like Hollywood made a movie of your micro memories!","title":"8-Bit Symphony @ Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2493665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair Bowness","original_name":"Alistair Bowness","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Elvin Bozbender","credit_id":"5e0917082fccee00125d888c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2238543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Daglish","original_name":"Ben Daglish","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself (archival footage)","credit_id":"5e091717a1c59d0018ab032b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jarle H.
