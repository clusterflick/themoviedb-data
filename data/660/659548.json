Six months have passed since the sudden death of her husband, Soichiro. In her resolve to move on, she has recently taken over the management of a boarding house owned by her father-in-law. She now finds herself reminiscing about the few seasons that she and Soichiro had together, and about the first time that she saw him: when he became her geology teacher during her final year of high school.  This prequel is the third and final OVA released after the conclusion of MAISON IKKOKU, an animated series based on the manga by Rumiko Takahashi.  The past events are retold through flashback sequences using scenes from the television series, with narration by Sumi Shimamoto as Kyoko.","popularity":1.3227,"poster_path":"/lKzmpQ6VPvHjtWCdzRWO5XFKefr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4766,"logo_path":"/9t3tuuujb3g1YRaQSJKM5v21e1Q.png","name":"Kitty Films","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6075,"logo_path":"/vlfJrLVL1TeNrCeeLBAwJXNv65M.png","name":"Studio Deen","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prelude Maison Ikkoku: When the Cherry Blossoms Return in the Spring","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Prélude Maison Ikkoku: Meguru haru no sakura no yō ni…","type":"Romanised Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Prelúdio Casa Ikkoku: Quando as Flores da Cerejeira Regressam na Primavera","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumi Shimamoto","original_name":"島本須美","popularity":0.9523,"profile_path":"/eCw8GSp5cmye3xgzm2cvv2KmWX4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kyoko Otonashi (voice)","credit_id":"5e0b7ba766540800133dd7fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideyuki Tanaka","original_name":"田中秀幸","popularity":0.9212,"profile_path":"/1D1PmELZexM6aod77gbh9GwvvGG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Souichirō Otonashi (voice)","credit_id":"5e0b7c25be6d88001601bd53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issei Futamata","original_name":"二又一成","popularity":0.7693,"profile_path":"/cZoRqxuTrEDwmMmgbFtgdRO27pQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Godai Yusaku (voice)","credit_id":"5e0b7c71be6d88001601bd93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryūji Saikachi","original_name":"槐柳二","popularity":0.4201,"profile_path":"/fGCuIdYNTiP7U6jqfPEUaPn8FXi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Otonashi-rōjin (voice)","credit_id":"5e46126141465c001ad4ea93","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585763,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rumiko Takahashi","original_name":"高橋留美子","popularity":0.3192,"profile_path":"/3C1oodp7PTT1wk4HGewoqgJmR4t.jpg","credit_id":"661847c5dbf144018685747a","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":635,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shigeharu Shiba","original_name":"斯波重治","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/b4GTUQ65teIQB0tbOsjwVWAxHde.jpg","credit_id":"6417916e6a222700e975d3ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585763,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rumiko Takahashi","original_name":"高橋留美子","popularity":0.3192,"profile_path":"/3C1oodp7PTT1wk4HGewoqgJmR4t.jpg","credit_id":"5e0b8767595a560011154d13","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pReXIuaM1IHDaO1O1HvjThj7lrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nhH4mZoEjWU2Sx2byyIiwXeSAO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKzmpQ6VPvHjtWCdzRWO5XFKefr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4129,"name":"widow"},{"id":2587,"name":"married couple"},{"id":9856,"name":"flashback"},{"id":12390,"name":"boarding house"},{"id":18447,"name":"japanese woman"},{"id":171826,"name":"told in flashback"},{"id":192498,"name":"japanese man"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1992-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Maison Ikkoku (Juliette je t'aime) OAV Prelude (2/3)","key":"hRkNKn02cMc","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-03-24T11:23:42.000Z","id":"5e0b843b66540800113dd3f9"}]}}}
