The rare genetic disease leads to learning disabilities and reduced cognitive behavior, giving Christina a challenging journey in many arenas. But is twenty-four years enough time to break the code of who and what an individual really is? Gåten Christina is a playful and warm take on the mission to answer this question. Who Christina is today and how she faced the school system and workforce growing up. The result is an authentic and sincere portrait of a unique individual journey that empathically puts the spotlight on the challenges a person with psychological disabilities meet in an every-day life.","popularity":0.1123,"poster_path":"/hoZiqV1NWar3aqLyNRPXggEqFVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85612,"logo_path":"/6cuKKspMcxvtaaT9zPJiBLJC2oe.png","name":"Fenomen tv film & scene AS","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2019-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Puzzle of Christina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May-Liss Wiik","original_name":"May-Liss Wiik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e0cd239c2f44b00172dcdf0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Winsents","original_name":"Christina Winsents","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e0cd2465541fa00111eee55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pål Winsents","original_name":"Pål Winsents","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e0cd4e768b1ea00157d7e46","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1741362,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Marius Kittilsen","original_name":"Tom Marius Kittilsen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd27dfd4f8000155d20fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495880,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eirik Kaasa Eliassen","original_name":"Eirik Kaasa Eliassen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd26e9974ee0015a47a4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pål Winsents","original_name":"Pål Winsents","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2626dc6c000134b1a68","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pål Winsents","original_name":"Pål Winsents","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2558586780018c0d423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123958,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Skafti Guðmundsson","original_name":"Skafti Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2d45541fa00111eeefa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495874,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fredrik Harreschou","original_name":"Fredrik Harreschou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd3801511aa0012b22ccf","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799686,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Buljo","original_name":"Georg Buljo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2a49974ee0012a4ae02","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pål Winsents","original_name":"Pål Winsents","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2c61511aa0012b22c32","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495874,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fredrik Harreschou","original_name":"Fredrik Harreschou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd371c2f44b00112de690","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1741362,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Marius Kittilsen","original_name":"Tom Marius Kittilsen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2bc6dc6c000134b1a8d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1741359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Fahre","original_name":"Daniel Fahre","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0cd2b168b1ea00137d80e5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonas B.
