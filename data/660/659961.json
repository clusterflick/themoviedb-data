A child is born. They are happy, but the young politician is running for office against the old ward boss and has to be out every night. The wife becomes jealous of a certain woman. Nora's child dies. Things get worse for her as jealousy and the seeming neglect of her husband increase. She finally leaves him and becomes a model for a noted painter. The husband finds where she is, but makes no attempt to force her to return to him, though he still loves her. One of the artist's friends, a magnate in the motion picture business, promises her a chance. Her rise to stardom is quick. The climax of the story is a struggle between the old love and the new fame. She does not know that the politician has become a first-class lawyer. Finding that the old love and the new fame are not incompatible, she is reunited with her husband.","popularity":0.1402,"poster_path":"/g1LcbxrYMPRz9wTJLK7Pp3jMZvH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rialto De Luxe Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":76383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ivan Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conquered Hearts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1119768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Marsh","original_name":"Marguerite Marsh","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":"/4ryYViMLMR3LBA4zhJA6MAXMPov.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nora Carrigan","credit_id":"5e0d7b8a12c60400173edb86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1503188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corene Uzzell","original_name":"Corene Uzzell","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kate Corcoran","credit_id":"5e0d7b8f5541fa00161f711b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Lowry","original_name":"Emma Lowry","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Brice","credit_id":"5e0d7b9612c60400143ea2da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2496568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Walker","original_name":"Eileen Walker","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Carrigan","credit_id":"5e0d7b9c6dc6c000154bb5b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Turner","original_name":"Richard Turner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dan Murdock","credit_id":"5e0d7bb26dc6c000134c2f41","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Myers","original_name":"Harry Myers","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v2Y70uGlW7FQV8khBqRUOUEdy4n.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stonne","credit_id":"5e0d7bbea84ff7001836365d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1634583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Paton Gibbs","original_name":"Robert Paton Gibbs","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/505OjfPiAs7cs1vPVpCwlZM9Ag1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Earl of Barchester","credit_id":"671cbc382685cb6563c0f1e1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2317619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Raymond","original_name":"Dean Raymond","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/zxFO1yp8Gt2kTfF6WBNlNSPEebs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mr. Chalmers","credit_id":"671cbc42a4ac8a432c5c65e2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barney Gilmore","original_name":"Barney Gilmore","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/1zssnBqPf7XYLeuNe0Nid3EQ6kF.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Devlin","credit_id":"671cbc4ce833d92ef0603a28","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Evans","original_name":"Frank Evans","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mr. Carrigan","credit_id":"671cbc5c2685cb6563c0f1eb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Sheridan","original_name":"James Sheridan","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/c5OGvJoTHxIlCeW9NsvNntJaiHo.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Reddy Carrigan","credit_id":"671cbc6ae833d92ef0603a3f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1850859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Franklin Thomas","original_name":"Al Franklin Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"671cbc71e833d92ef0603a44","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Bell Clifton","original_name":"Emma Bell Clifton","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/6s6wkCvgZW8LP0E7AlJf91dgmbo.jpg","credit_id":"5e0d7be35541fa00131f175a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis J.
