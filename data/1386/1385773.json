For hundreds of years, Poles and Jews peacefully coexisted in this little-known enclave. Today, this sleepy farm town has not a single Jewish resident, and even the Jewish tombstones are gone, having been stolen from the cemetery to be used by locals as grindstones and building materials. When the descendants of the town's Jews travel from San Francisco to Gniewoszów to search out and honor whatever traces of their heritage they can find, the filmmaker uncovers both harrowing and inspiring accounts of the past.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":"/mJlq0QTutq8kHTsjLc7wUwQVCJ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Among Neighbors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoav Potash","original_name":"Yoav Potash","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675039075201f8c15f178af1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoav Potash","original_name":"Yoav Potash","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a8d5d619d772affbf73a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7758540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mJlq0QTutq8kHTsjLc7wUwQVCJ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yes VOD","release_date":"2025-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish Film Institute WinterFest","release_date":"2025-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
