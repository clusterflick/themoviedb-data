In conversation with the artist we discovered how “poverty” is a un concept learnt from outside to see ourselves, that generates a fragmented vision of out own reality. The process of discovering our wealth is the process of the cultural re-appropriation that we have challenged the new generations to enjoy, to honor what we are. The labelling of our people as poor, a labelling that comes from the capital cities, is a form of violence that questions what we are as peoples, as well as questioning our way of life and culture.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/ibKUaADnh58pZoEF7recVmwLMLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138984,"logo_path":"/jYUNOoyeZt5nBzvNYcRAWPHFLma.png","name":"Brujazul","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2019-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aquí viví","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2248134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luna Marán","original_name":"Luna Marán","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kApFs94XiDMwLFCRZJpYRepXxYp.jpg","credit_id":"672f94bbb8d71b75d6db9d63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ibKUaADnh58pZoEF7recVmwLMLR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
