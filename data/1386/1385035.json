But the music of Richard Strauss, who pulls out all the stops of his orchestral art, from the late romantic intoxication to the most modern discord, creates a subtle, colorful panorama of a society in transition, whose late-bourgeois values ​​are crumbling. One's own identity and interpersonal relationships have to be tested from scratch. Central is – even more than the title character, who oscillates between romance and rebellion – Arabella's younger sister Zdenka, who, disguised as a man by her parents for lack of money for girls' clothes befitting their status, has to struggle all the more desperately with her/his role as an outsider.","popularity":0.1345,"poster_path":"/fTskWyBbjeX8BmnWll0UBhCTnUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Oper Berlin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Deutsche Oper Berlin","title":"Arabella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1897828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Jakubiak","original_name":"Sara Jakubiak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qwQUpAfgt9rqsENwddnSgaX9ipO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Arabella","credit_id":"672f6be149ad5afefc301757","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Tsallagova","original_name":"Elena Tsallagova","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Zdenka","credit_id":"672f6c143d1b19bf3dbc2943","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Pesendorfer","original_name":"Albert Pesendorfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Graf Waldner","credit_id":"672f6c4f49ad5afefc30178e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Soffel ","original_name":"Doris Soffel ","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/yvGULEzL5FYrCmxAeiDjFrL0n5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Adelaide","credit_id":"672f6c801770b0351de38286","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Braun","original_name":"Russell Braun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mandryka","credit_id":"672f6caa6be32e3055d3905a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591051,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Watson","original_name":"Robert Watson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Matteo","credit_id":"672f6cdc6be32e3055d3906d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4728788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Blondelle","original_name":"Thomas Blondelle","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Graf Elemer","credit_id":"672f6cf66be32e3055d3907c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Miller","original_name":"Kyle Miller","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Graf Dominik","credit_id":"672f6d0d1770b0351de382d7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Zimmerman","original_name":"Tyler Zimmerman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Graf Lamoral","credit_id":"672f6d2b3d1b19bf3dbc2984","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338172,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Donald Runnicles","original_name":"Donald Runnicles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"672f6d4d1770b0351de382ea","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"672f6d6a3d1b19bf3dbc299a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Kratzer","original_name":"Tobias Kratzer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672f6d7b1770b0351de38300","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTskWyBbjeX8BmnWll0UBhCTnUR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
