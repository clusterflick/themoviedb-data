One of them is 67-year-old Bernie Wagenblast, one of New York’s most famous voices. She is one of the male subway voices, heard by millions of commuters every day. She feels comfortable with both her voices. The other character is 25-year-old Jade Stephan, who feels that her “old voice is something that she treasures as a thing she will not be bringing out for company”. She is currently seeing a voice therapist to help her work on her voice. This film explores their relationship to their voices and how voices can be a factor in integration into society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5OdLE6nr9EANuZihpvMgksH7CdW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding My Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5267658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Wagenblast","original_name":"Bernie Wagenblast","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"67bd0714a1e6fb93c26bea0a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouven Gueissaz","original_name":"Rouven Gueissaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673121dab34fab2308ebc766","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouven Gueissaz","original_name":"Rouven Gueissaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673121e0633d5e2026ffb09e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouven Gueissaz","original_name":"Rouven Gueissaz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673121eb6a2963dbade7d7cd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5OdLE6nr9EANuZihpvMgksH7CdW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
