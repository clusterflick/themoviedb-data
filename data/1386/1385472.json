Dolce takes place in Italy, where the director Lucie Pannetrat spent her holiday as a child. The film is a tribute to her italian roots, her memory and italian paintings, wich defined her relationship to this territory. Dolce means sweetness, that is to say as in French, it designates both the quality of what is sweet but also the confectionery. The title has this double meaning, to be like a little delicacy that we want to eat, rather seductive, and that it recalls the tragedy of time which is flowing gently. The title is a bit ironic.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dolce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5050536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Pannetrat","original_name":"Lucie Pannetrat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6730955811b6cc0571f65418","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
