Throughout its history, Act Up has invented a new, provocative, and radical way of campaigning; it has brought HIV-positive people and the gay community out of invisibility; it has forced public authorities and pharmaceutical companies to take the epidemic seriously; and, thanks to its information and prevention work, it has saved many lives. All of this continues to do today when a general slackening of youthful attitudes is leading us to fear a resurgence of the epidemic. With Act Up ou le chaos, Pierre Chassagnieux & Matthieu Lère deliver, for the first time, an exhaustive documentary account of the terrible yet magnificent history of Act Up-Paris. They draw on never-before-seen archives and the exceptional participation of those who have made and continue to make Act Up.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/56HMTSNKL7pEVRLvHIDGQZLmPOj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Act Up ou le chaos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Chassagnieux","original_name":"Pierre Chassagnieux","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673072c33c104d88bdc5b6ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthieu Lère","original_name":"Matthieu Lère","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673072d257b301f3c931b0c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Chassagnieux","original_name":"Pierre Chassagnieux","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673072da0d133cd47332448a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2121300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie Drogue","original_name":"Marie Drogue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673072ee3c104d88bdc5b701","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121299,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Romain Pieri","original_name":"Romain Pieri","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673073003c104d88bdc5b709","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hdZTR0dCddHkqrg8dDUItUmSYfi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/56HMTSNKL7pEVRLvHIDGQZLmPOj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Chéries-Chéris","release_date":"2024-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Histoire TV","release_date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
