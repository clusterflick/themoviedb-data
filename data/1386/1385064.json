This road used to connect the cities of Turku and Helsinki, the former and the current capital of Finland. Today, after the introduction of bigger and more up-to-date connections, the old road has significantly quieted down and most of the roadside attractions have now been closed. However, the landscapes, locations and recollections from the past are still very strongly present.  The piece is available as a traditional one-channel film and as a three-channel installation.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Order","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672f78fc49ad5afefc301969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
