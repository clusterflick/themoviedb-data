The student interactions are certainly drama-filled, but they seem, sadly, fairly ordinary. Until, a single event escalates a consistent feud. Days later, the students are trapped in class as an active shooter terrorizes the campus. While the students hunker in terror, they vigorously argue about their conditions. The room is rife with fear, rage and tears that becomes blame thrown, protocol challenged and discoveries made. Through it all, the looming question cannot be avoided: will they make it out alive?","popularity":0.1981,"poster_path":"/dHUTKaYhvtyfJi649tjPCkYOGX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It was a day-in-the-life in class... until the shooting started.","title":"Dying to Learn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Reynolds","original_name":"James Reynolds","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/s8KlOkYy6YTsK1eH8W6ng1H4u5b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Cody","credit_id":"67312b593de68be94d68c440","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4316774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Golden","original_name":"Jake Golden","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uVVTfKKc3hV9LxQ6FrnCwEImE7p.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Billy Jansen","credit_id":"67312b833db73e7561781dbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armani Barrett","original_name":"Armani Barrett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Fabian McAvoy","credit_id":"67312bbff8920a9b0d8c6759","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LeRoi Armone Barrett","original_name":"LeRoi Armone Barrett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Draco Vishes","credit_id":"67312bebf0fe8e126d33126e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3594058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan T.
