Experiencing his two Iphigenias in a single evening goes beyond the norms of operatic life: it is to enter the very heart of the curse on the family of King Atreus of Mycenae, to follow a logical destiny through a cycle of endless violence. How does the victim of Aulis become the murderess of Tauris? That is the burning question that Dmitri Tcherniakov must adress, plunging the spectator into the midst of a household haunted by the dead and setting in train an implacable process of dehumanization, with parallels to our world today. Conducting Le Concert d’Astrée, Emmanuelle Haïm drives this dual tragedy to the summit of its expressive power, leaving humanity to be translated through arias of the utmost poignancy.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/5BvW10N5Ejb3u0pyOkq5uATPbp1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Festival d'Aix-en-Provence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":233,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aix-en-Provence 2024","title":"Iphigenie en Aulide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Winters","original_name":"Corinne Winters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Iphigenie","credit_id":"672f721ec80431f7167c445e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1628724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Braun","original_name":"Russell Braun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zdzLP7sbBjzD0AQ4UceDQxxBOBU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Agamemnon","credit_id":"672f723245b870231962a5a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véronique Gens","original_name":"Véronique Gens","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/3UtOl46qGJRqmbBz9zKZlJxyQly.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clytemnestra","credit_id":"672f724e5a65bb8190dd1ba0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alasadair Kent","original_name":"Alasadair Kent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Achille","credit_id":"672f72655a65bb8190dd1bad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Cavallier","original_name":"Nicolas Cavallier","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Calchas","credit_id":"672f72745a65bb8190dd1bb8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soula Parassidis","original_name":"Soula Parassidis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"672f7283a71aea7caff9c436","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Sempey","original_name":"Florian Sempey","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/zIox1mOuEeWMNIulXzq9apCqMPm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Oreste","credit_id":"672f7326ac970aad2a8d729f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanislas de Barbeyrac","original_name":"Stanislas de Barbeyrac","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Pylade","credit_id":"672f7336c80431f7167c44be","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3072069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Duhamel","original_name":"Alexandre Duhamel","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Thoas","credit_id":"672f7350c80431f7167c44c3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564366,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emmanuelle Haïm","original_name":"Emmanuelle Haïm","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"672f73693d1b19bf3dbc2ab4","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672f737e0d133cd4733225af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","original_name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/42uxTZ5tUwRmgFMT7jrWlKcKQOr.jpg","credit_id":"672f73923c104d88bdc59aed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2351,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5BvW10N5Ejb3u0pyOkq5uATPbp1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1572},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2351,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eMBdaCLjDTwv3GXWKus1In9uovz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
