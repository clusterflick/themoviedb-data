In fact the first Lumière brothers film “Workers Leaving the Factory” from 1895 has often been credited as the first motion picture ever made. In the 20th century also many experimental filmmakers depicted the rat race of modern life in their own way. Such films include for example “Manhatta” (1921) by Paul Strand & Charles Sheeler, “By Night with Torch and Spear” (1940s) by Joseph Cornell and “Necrology” (1969-1970) by Standish Lavender. The films “Men at Work” and “Smokestacks, Below” continue the same tradition.  These films also form a two-film series describing factory work as they have been compiled from the same found footage material. When screened together they demonstrate aptly the vast possibilities of found footage filmmaking. However, the films can be screened individually as well.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men at work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672fae7c49ad5afefc30239d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
