Lena finds an unexpected companion in Leon. Despite their differences and seemingly opposite worlds, a deep connection forms between them—one that will bind them until death. In his new film, Germinal Roaux, one of the most unique voices of contemporary European cinema, delivers a philosophical story about aging and the decay of the body. Above all, it’s about solidarity and the small gestures of love that give meaning—and dignity—to our existence. True to the aesthetic codes established in his previous works, Roaux’s film, shot in black and white and unfolding with a ritualistic rhythm that mirrors the slow passage of time at the twilight of life, speaks poetically and with genuine emotion about the most essential bond that connects us: love.","popularity":0.3377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":211533,"logo_path":"/sU3y20XNpm39PCgxmaLna8EK3fo.png","name":"Cinevinay","origin_country":"UY"},{"id":57432,"logo_path":"/87nyzjM86z0wopuV63t3NjnCpu2.png","name":"Close
