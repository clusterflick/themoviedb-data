With no script to rely on, two actors and a musician embark on a journey of improvisation, exploring the intricacies of their craft and their identities in a confined, isolated space. Guided by a director obsessed with uncovering \"truth\" in performance, the actors navigate the emotional demands of unscripted storytelling. As they delve deeper into their roles, subtle tensions and queer themes begin to surface, revealing the raw, unguarded aspects of their personalities. Shot entirely in black and white, Les Étoiles becomes a stripped-down exploration of the boundaries between artist, art, and authenticity.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/5PA7pQcTxjTnPUWfgjDfZ3gv4Qu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oriol Pla","original_name":"Oriol Pla","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/g41bW9gwGLwj6gLLboX6uuut8HT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"672f933b59036d2bcf08f46d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pol López","original_name":"Pol López","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/368WhG9jONooXjBla3SznuTf76Z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"672f9346b8d71b75d6db9cd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramon Bassal","original_name":"Ramon Bassal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"672f935945b870231962add7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salvador Sunyer","original_name":"Salvador Sunyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vDBiiF8kPUp7c6XkujnyOxk1Qx4.jpg","credit_id":"672f9316c31a5dcbb21484bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5PA7pQcTxjTnPUWfgjDfZ3gv4Qu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
