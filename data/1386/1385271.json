Donald is attacked by a mad Portuguese and is knocked unconscious; Cecilie mistakes him for dead and leaves him behind on the island when a rescue party arrives. She returns to the United States and goes to see Donald's wealthy family. They not only refuse to recognize her as Donald's wife but also refuse to recognize her baby as Donald's child. Donald's brother offers to take her as his mistress, however; when she refuses, he attempts to bribe her into giving up all claims on the Van Buren name. John Wendell, the family lawyer, takes pity on Cecilie and offers her the protection of his name in marriage; she accepts, with the provision that it be in name only but trouble is on the horizon.","popularity":0.1763,"poster_path":"/roJs0leXKxnhs8gnkuIcBvjeZnF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14950,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.P.
