During his long absence, his son Idamantes took care of the affairs of government and the Troyan prisoners of war, including Ilia, the daughter of King Priam. In order to get out alive from the storm that prevents him from landing in Crete, he promises to sacrifice the first living creature he encounters on his home soil to the sea god Poseidon. Unfortunately, this is his son who rushes to greet him. By sacrificing her life for Idamante's, whom she loves and who reciprocates her love, Ilia manages to appease Poseidon and release Idomeneo from his fateful oath.
