These parts/directions have in common that they appear through or because of the wind.  The work opens with the text: ‘We only see the fluttering of the flag. The force behind its movement remains invisible.’ Next, the camera, attached to a wind vane, moves around chaotically.  Curtains are waving softly, affecting our view of a block of flats. The camera determines our view, literally, by alternatively focusing and moving out of focus. Then the curtain flaps in front of a screen, which shows Marilyn Monroe wearing a number of tulle shawls. This cover aimed at revealing more than it covered. But the tulle curtains prove exactly the opposite, because the viewer in fact reverts to being a voyeur again.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Force Behind Its Movement Stiftung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madelon Hooykaas","original_name":"Madelon Hooykaas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672fb4d09690098d8eae85de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elsa Stansfield","original_name":"Elsa Stansfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672fb4db11b6cc0571f62ec6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
