The lovers live their connection in secret, which inevitably has to be discovered and leads to catastrophe. The visually stunning production by Marco Arturo Marelli prepares the ground for the secret of this love in space and color, captured in Richard Wagner's opera, which premiered in 1865, in which the music becomes almost the sole carrier of the plot.","popularity":0.1335,"poster_path":"/64fQptb0n857Dlp9a9SMEiYG5Y1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Semperoper Dresden","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":234,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Semperoper Dresden","title":"Tristan und Isolde","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Nylund","original_name":"Camilla Nylund","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/iM1TQQICMYX2qwIaZakmJPJ49ZM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Isolde","credit_id":"6730a4e18f81fed6bd3f7766","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Florian Vogt","original_name":"Klaus Florian Vogt","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":"/k8Qtv1DvrgiKsNLaCitHsxglGTU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tristan","credit_id":"6730a4ef6dddd88d089cb9bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1559109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Zeppenfeld","original_name":"Georg Zeppenfeld","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/k8Nd6GsmwGirrDUIK51aC0SNRQB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"König Marke","credit_id":"6730a4fc6dddd88d089cb9c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2205447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanja Ariane Baumgartner","original_name":"Tanja Ariane Baumgartner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Brangäne","credit_id":"6730a50e0d133cd4733249f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Gantner","original_name":"Martin Gantner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kurwenal","credit_id":"6730a5220d133cd4733249fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Wartig","original_name":"Sebastian Wartig","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Melot","credit_id":"6730a53149ad5afefc302e15","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Thielemann","original_name":"Christian Thielemann","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/jji3gjbi61pWVsHy9TesDKyWvzF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6730a53cac970aad2a8d9455","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"6730a54a8f81fed6bd3f7784","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Arturo Marelli","original_name":"Marco Arturo Marelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6730a5660d133cd473324a2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2365,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/64fQptb0n857Dlp9a9SMEiYG5Y1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
