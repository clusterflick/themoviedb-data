It's a story inspired by Alberto Moravia's novel which was already adapted for the cinema by Vittorio De Sica in 1960, bagging Sophia Loren an Academy Award for her starring performance. La Ciociara, performed here on an Irish festival stage, offers a poignant operatic experience with powerful themes that resonate through time.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/gsN5FupQOMNw1FmlutB6TVauMtr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244360,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wexford Festival Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2023-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wexford Festival Opera","title":"La Ciociara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jade Phénix","original_name":"Jade Phénix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rosetta","credit_id":"6730e06811b6cc0571f65d5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4011610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Caimi","original_name":"Leonardo Caimi","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/zyY4kIazAzaBgf5M5qqfPD0lif6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michele","credit_id":"6730e07711b6cc0571f65d67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devid Cecconi","original_name":"Devid Cecconi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yS82SwW9kT7yLd77JgeLDGlafnT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giovanni","credit_id":"6730e08cb8d71b75d6dbc57c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Na'ama Goldman","original_name":"Na'ama Goldman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cesira","credit_id":"6730e0a711b6cc0571f65d85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Kiechle","original_name":"Alexandre Kiechle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fedor von Bock","credit_id":"6730e0c2b8d71b75d6dbc591","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Cilluffo","original_name":"Francesco Cilluffo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6730e0d1b8d71b75d6dbc5a7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051011,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Tutino","original_name":"Marco Tutino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6730e106445efe781843d879","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosetta Cucchi","original_name":"Rosetta Cucchi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6730e11af6c5a8269effa760","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34722591","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":2374,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsN5FupQOMNw1FmlutB6TVauMtr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
