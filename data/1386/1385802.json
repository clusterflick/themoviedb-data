It is the time of the Viet Nam War. Slowly we are introduced to three sets of characters whose decisions ultimately determine the course of Arthur's resolution to his dilemma, and thus his life. First comes a group of non-Americans. Then a second group consisting of actual friends, family and acquaintances of Arthur the actor. Finally, the third group, a cross-section of Americans: teenie boppers, suburbanites, Green Berets, an artist and a Spanish American War vet. The final solution is brought about by bringing the non-Americans together in an auditorium, showing them all the previously shot footage and asking them to vote on what they think Arthur should do.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sE510Bl9lxXgYPgKKUEVyX5i7AB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keeping Things Whole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Albert","original_name":"Arthur Albert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"673142a9060e42935fb66104","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Feher","original_name":"John Feher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"673142bdf8920a9b0d8c68f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Karam Hill","original_name":"Elena Karam Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"673142c6f8920a9b0d8c6908","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex de le Vega","original_name":"Alex de le Vega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"673142cec932845557a79df8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6731428ac932845557a79dc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673142dcc932845557a79dfe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673142e6eff8b0cfae8e31f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5051875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry Savage III","original_name":"Henry Savage III","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673142fa060e42935fb6612c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3257410","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sE510Bl9lxXgYPgKKUEVyX5i7AB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Work in progress shown at Millennium Film Workshop","release_date":"1970-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
