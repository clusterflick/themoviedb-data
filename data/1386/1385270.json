James Beveridge spent a year in Japan making this film about the National Living Treasures of Japan. Beveridge completely abandoned the use of narration and it created a huge split with his funders. He insisted on completing the film his way, with an austere sound track using “Noh” music and song, no narration, and a mix of natural sounds including those of the artists making their crafts. Crafts featured include pottery, weaving, paper making, and blacksmithing.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":244306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mobil Oil","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547448,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Beveridge","original_name":"James Beveridge","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5Jf6HkeCd2aiLaQr22oT4k19Feb.jpg","credit_id":"672fe415a71aea7caff9cf1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049832,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mainichi Films","original_name":"Mainichi Films","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672fe43759036d2bcf08ff37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
