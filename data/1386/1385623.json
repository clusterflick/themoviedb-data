He has no idea where it came from. Disturbed and intrigued, he calls Cecilia (his ex-partner), who is pregnant with her new partner’s child, to help him figure out what to do.  A part is an independent element that can be considered or included within a whole. It can also be a person or group that stands in opposition to another in a discussion or in a war. It might be a brief exchange, or perhaps just any place.  This is a story that begins early in the morning.  A rock appeared on the terrace.  A giant rock.  Miguel calls his ex-girlfriend and asks for help.  But this is only a part.","popularity":0.2375,"poster_path":"/eiHMJVQzKhVzwl2qLQuuGt0etIG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maleza
