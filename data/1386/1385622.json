Fast. Die.","overview":"Allin was a cult and fringe figure in the 1980s punk scene who became notorious for his outrageous behavior at shows, notably defecating onstage and sometimes hurling it at his audience. His shows frequently ended in chaos and violence, and he found himself frequently arrested and imprisoned. Allin fell headlong into booze and drugs while putting out albums — punk, spoken word and country — mostly on cassette in the 80s.","popularity":0.2255,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Angry Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":151558,"logo_path":null,"name":"MVD Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"GG Allin: Live.
