It shows how it was formed, changed, filled with borrowed words and formed its own neologisms. The film is divided into five historically important periods: Rus, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Hetmanate, the Russian Empire, and the Soviet Union. Each era “spoke” its own language, and here you will hear for the first time how it sounded in different centuries.  The presenter, a famous theater and film actor Oleksii Hnatkovskyi, will guide the viewer through the historical periods. In a simple, accurate, sometimes humorous way, he will tell how our language developed during the periods of creation, development, division, fierce wars and total bans.","popularity":0.1315,"poster_path":"/peoLNwPlHNtFfFLxd5ZhfHXDf3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How did the Ukrainian language emerge?","title":"How Ukrainians Started Speaking Ukrainian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleksii Hnatkovskyi","original_name":"Oleksii Hnatkovskyi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pfRLNo9VJWjZ0YLMb2O3kp9V22C.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host - self","credit_id":"6730a9eea71aea7caff9e2dc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2740123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volodymyr Bakum","original_name":"Volodymyr Bakum","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7xYpdyOR8w46WpIv559Bk6rKy0L.jpg","credit_id":"67433141fb58d769bdbbd122","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2740123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volodymyr Bakum","original_name":"Volodymyr Bakum","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7xYpdyOR8w46WpIv559Bk6rKy0L.jpg","credit_id":"6743315e8b4e4c2ef6f7e38b","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2740123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volodymyr Bakum","original_name":"Volodymyr Bakum","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7xYpdyOR8w46WpIv559Bk6rKy0L.jpg","credit_id":"674331808b4e4c2ef6f7e39d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4629690,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oleksandr Sukhov","original_name":"Oleksandr Sukhov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674334b34d50ccd7da48ada2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4629689,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Snizhana Kutrakova","original_name":"Snizhana Kutrakova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674334da7b825e685b4e8edf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/peoLNwPlHNtFfFLxd5ZhfHXDf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":295361,"name":"ukrainian language"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KyivBookFest (special screening)","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2024-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Suspilne","release_date":"2024-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
