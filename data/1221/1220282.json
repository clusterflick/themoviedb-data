There are four possibilities. Despite being insecure and afraid, she gets in touch with the potential parents. Everyone claims that the child can’t be theirs because they didn’t come. She didn’t come either. The solitary pregnancy takes a turn.  When the child is born, her restlessness takes shape: she goes on a quest to find out who her child’s father is. The pressure and overload on her reveal a cycle of violence. In an honest and direct way, the documentary is a trigger of unease, exposing the negligence of parental abandonment.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":"/eXb4VLJymLizxnqnmdCTdI1m37f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bela Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":147924,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arenga Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2024-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I did not come either","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luz Bárbara","original_name":"Luz Bárbara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821eb28dbc3308f4996a11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Carolina Marinho","original_name":"Ana Carolina Marinho","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821e83cedac408277e249c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2946993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Zêpa","original_name":"Anna Zêpa","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821e993a48c5166faf677d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3860786,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Bortolo","original_name":"Amanda Bortolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821e528dbc3308899a581e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4439266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amanda Bortolo","original_name":"Amanda Bortolo","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821e6ad5191f08c0ae2c6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Carolina Marinho","original_name":"Ana Carolina Marinho","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821dcf2f8d0908d5a8dcef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269413,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristina Amaral","original_name":"Cristina Amaral","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/1JUSsjKW0h4MOJ1vcbYEeOdzzri.jpg","credit_id":"65821ee88dbc3308d799b5e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letícia Bassit","original_name":"Letícia Bassit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yUZXOo5AtqX75BawFfrgQW9hWM3.jpg","credit_id":"65821ecb02576407fd48f94d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4439270,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bárbara Santos","original_name":"Bárbara Santos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821f60ac617c087215f9b8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3860786,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Bortolo","original_name":"Amanda Bortolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821f092f8d0908d5a8dd39","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Carolina Marinho","original_name":"Ana Carolina Marinho","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821f220e64af0876a87d1e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2946993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Zêpa","original_name":"Anna Zêpa","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65821f34bf0f63089362c6a9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aAotcVq1ODHhoeQsyowYCRBfPFy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXb4VLJymLizxnqnmdCTdI1m37f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
