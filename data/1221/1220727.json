In just over a year more than one hundred people were poisoned. Most of the killers were women. Recipe For Murder tells the true story of three notorious poisoners; Yvonne Fletcher, Caroline Grills and Veronica Monty. The 52 minute film combines gritty archive with stunning film noir re-enactments and interviews with witnesses. Narrated by Dan Wyllie in classic pulp crime style, the film dramatically reveals the unique ingredients that created a Recipe For Murder.","popularity":1.0086,"poster_path":"/l6J5P6KGLcxqnBBeEaClCBz4yUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stray Dog Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":160903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jumping Dog Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10951,"logo_path":"/jxfMNlkvI3GxnS41xCSOLD7goVb.png","name":"Screen NSW","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sydney 1952...
