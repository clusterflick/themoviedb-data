In this context, the islet could have sunk under concrete and pollution, and the reef could have been irreparably impacted. However, thanks to the will of a handful of inhabitants including the mayor of the island, Bora Bora is today a model of sustainable development, with water treatment technologies that are 15 years ahead of France, programs to rebuild corals and protect wildlife, educational actions and the rehabilitation of Polynesian traditions such as “rahui” and the establishment of a monitoring network using new technologies. All of this makes the island a veritable open-air laboratory that shows the way for all tropical coastal environments around the world.","popularity":0.4428,"poster_path":"/t6JZcQqk2gY016W47ey0vZTwQw7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72551,"logo_path":"/rNloA4FjzBYryTnc13ANVWolRUp.png","name":"Artisans du Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bora Bora, le laboratoire du futur","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Laguerre","original_name":"Antoine Laguerre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581f434bf0f6308ae6272f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4017320,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"L'Atelier","original_name":"L'Atelier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581f45fbf0f6308eb61acb9","department":"Production","job":"Post Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2923728,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grégoire Laugier","original_name":"Grégoire Laugier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581f44a0e64af0839a9275a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oq85C5uQy7RoZMFhdd73o8Nb8Lv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.758,"height":1187,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/t6JZcQqk2gY016W47ey0vZTwQw7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2763,"name":"human vs nature"},{"id":3343,"name":"coral reef"},{"id":204009,"name":"tourism"},{"id":205040,"name":"bora bora"},{"id":211505,"name":"wildlife conservation"},{"id":215533,"name":"french polynesia"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":244692,"name":"eco-sustainability"},{"id":257091,"name":"sustainable solutions"},{"id":262212,"name":"nature reserve"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":264662,"name":"sustainable tourism"},{"id":296603,"name":"human impact"},{"id":317231,"name":"tourism revitalization"},{"id":317276,"name":"tourism development"},{"id":324202,"name":"sustainable technology"},{"id":325892,"name":"science documentary"},{"id":328438,"name":"resilience of nature"},{"id":333966,"name":"coastal waters"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
