The garrison commander greets a motley group of foreign visitors as the waiters open the champagne to start the show. The perspectives alternate, the bah-humbug atmosphere at the guests' table is counterpointed by the reluctance of the performers and the resentment of those who prepare the meal and must serve the guests. From this group, the character played by Marga Barbu stands out for her eccentric, disruptive presence, upsetting the fragile balance of the whole performance and aggravating the already tense situation towards its dramatic climax.","popularity":0.0451,"poster_path":"/esz3qpkKfzF93SNoBvQMGBjA96L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universitatea Nationala de Arta Teatrala si Cinematografica \"I.L.
