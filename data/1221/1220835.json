A respite from, and warning about, an uncertain environmental future at a time of 113-degree F/45-degree C heat, drought, and millennial fires in my home of California. A meditation on time, attention, and reverie, and a recognition of human traces within an implacable environment.","popularity":0.0817,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land Under Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Feeney","original_name":"Tim Feeney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6584176aca83544103d7a416","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Cinema Carnival","release_date":"2023-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
