Filmed at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, Chibayish records the artist’s interactions with three young marshland residents: Riad Samir and Jassim and Qassim Mohammed. It includes footage of the children caring for a water buffalo, describing their geography, naming members of the community, and traversing a marsh engulfed by oil infrastructure and industrial waste. Chibayish is part of a larger group of works that Farid has developed since 2018 focused on the impact of extractive industries on southern Iraq and Kuwait’s ecological and social fabric. Like her installation Palm Orchard (2022), Chibayish is an exploration of cultural identity, history, colonialism, and the right to remain.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/wEAZDsTLm1QXTnwTHocpapnq5ou.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203985,"logo_path":"/f96v4DEfvujq2dUUQMAogZpFT0U.png","name":"The Vega Foundation","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8152,"logo_path":"/shnLD1Pj9d1vB2TH93QHSNT5gzW.png","name":"DFI","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KW","name":"Kuwait"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chibayish 2023","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riad Samir","original_name":"Riad Samir","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6583ab07f1759c403210dd96","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jassim Mohammed","original_name":"Jassim Mohammed","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6583ab17e8131d40f1a51851","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Qassim Mohammed","original_name":"Qassim Mohammed","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6583ab2108354744c23ecdce","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hassan Alaydani","original_name":"Hassan Alaydani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aadc55bc35577c17f0a3","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441424,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","original_name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aa7ff1759c3f5111376b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441431,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hussein Alasadi","original_name":"Hussein Alasadi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aae708354746c93e5ac1","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441428,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Riad Bahrani","original_name":"Riad Bahrani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aac2180dea530a8c147c","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441429,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fatima Bahrani","original_name":"Fatima Bahrani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aaccf1759c3fd910fe9e","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973716,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Belal Hibri","original_name":"Belal Hibri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aab0e295b43d1d685974","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441424,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","original_name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aa8b180dea53b98c0055","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441410,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Rodriguez","original_name":"Joel Rodriguez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aaa0b34409468c1b4022","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alia Farid","original_name":"Alia Farid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6585e48b47721519ce4313c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wEAZDsTLm1QXTnwTHocpapnq5ou.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
