Her new film Chibayish was recorded in the marshlands of southern Iraq, at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in a region engulfed by oil infrastructure and industrial waste. It captures the artist’s exchanges with three young residents as they map the community that inhabits the marsh, and belt out calls to the buffalo that roam its waters. Mixing footage with CGI animation, Chibayish comes to explore cultural identity, history, colonialism and the right to remain.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/ccgkuhakDKnXoxB2HjEd5LAzgvT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chibayish 2022","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riad Samir","original_name":"Riad Samir","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6583a81d08354745553e90b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jassim Mohammed","original_name":"Jassim Mohammed","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6583a8388586785635f68c58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Qassim Mohammed","original_name":"Qassim Mohammed","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6583a847fbe36f4aad7f5734","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973716,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Belal Hibri","original_name":"Belal Hibri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583a8aae295b43bc768c42e","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441424,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","original_name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aa5eca83544156d74c7b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441410,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Rodriguez","original_name":"Joel Rodriguez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583a89385867855daf6a128","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441424,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","original_name":"Muhammed Al Mubarak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583aa6c88055141c7279002","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alia Farid","original_name":"Alia Farid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6583a8be992fe63e36729fb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ccgkuhakDKnXoxB2HjEd5LAzgvT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
