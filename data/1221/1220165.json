In his life he has spent nearly 12 years in this hut, where he wrote several books and essays on philosophy and ecology. In this film, Naess tells about the concept of 'deep ecology', which was first introduced by him in 1973. One of the basic tenets of deep ecology is that nature has a value in itself, apart from its possible use value to humans. Next to being a famous mountaineer, Naess has been a longtime activist in the environmental movement. He gives an inspiring account of his participation in blockades to prevent the Alta river in northern Norway (the area of the Sami, an indigenous people) from being dammed.","popularity":0.8067,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Call of the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arne Næss","original_name":"Arne Næss","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/69jBFG4a78w5fEjQPKMg8asxkcm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6581c4d5875d1a07aaaf4318","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vandana Shiva","original_name":"Vandana Shiva","popularity":0.2463,"profile_path":"/knwbovedVTC2cAEXjVLvRGWgrUa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6581c4e9bf0f6308ce61f239","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Glasser","original_name":"Harold Glasser","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6581c5097e403d0946f54cfd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1003054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Norberg-Hodge","original_name":"Helena Norberg-Hodge","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/dENqhH0sqB2rypUOlff6cauqeSD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6581c51634e152087f082b02","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Sessions","original_name":"George Sessions","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6581c530cedac408457ddf6e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan van Boeckel","original_name":"Jan van Boeckel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self (interviewer)","credit_id":"6581c54c3a48c57e16af6621","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Devall","original_name":"Bill Devall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6581c56b875d1a07aaaf4343","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan van Boeckel","original_name":"Jan van Boeckel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581c59b02576407fd48e8d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan van Boeckel","original_name":"Jan van Boeckel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581c58ed5191f08a4ae2c29","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3106570","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":154061,"name":"global"},{"id":197526,"name":"enviroment"},{"id":258385,"name":"spiritual awareness"},{"id":326431,"name":"deep ecology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Call of the Mountain ~ Arne Naess and the Deep Ecology Movement (full version)","key":"Wf3cXTAqS2M","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-22T13:27:36.000Z","id":"6581c69fd5191f08f5adab20"}]}}}
