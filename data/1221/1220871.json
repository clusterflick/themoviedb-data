But the paradox of whiteness in Israel is that Ashkenazim aren’t exactly “white folks” historically... A story that begins in the Rhineland and ends in the holy land (or is it the other way around?), ASHKENAZ looks at whiteness in Israel and wonders: How did the “others” of Europe become the “Europe” of the others?","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashkenaz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":930630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Leah Jones","original_name":"Rachel Leah Jones","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6584310a08354745553eb7bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11483454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
