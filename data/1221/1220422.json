Pink has no place in the soul of humans living in the modern urban, who desire the material enjoyment. They are Thu, an astute young woman with wild passion; Quy, a student who has burning desire to reach the Western civilization; or Thanh a romantic but spineless archaeological researcher... The profound meaning of the movie is wrapped up in its last scene - inside the towering apartment buildings, the peach blossom still remains its gorgeous pink despite such unprecedented storm and painful tragedy in a rustic family.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peach Blossoms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4439966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nguyễn Thế Vinh","original_name":"Nguyễn Thế Vinh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658291cbb1131f52a9ae7968","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30474345","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
