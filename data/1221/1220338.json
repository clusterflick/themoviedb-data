This is the title Jean-Luc Godard chose for his final film, which was literally completed the day before his self-death. The two segments of this film open with a series of identical sequences. The second segment then diverges and ends on a self-portrait of Jean-Luc Godard -his last images- sitting on his bed, bare-chested, he hides none of the wear on his body in the manner of Pigalle's sculpted portrait of Voltaire. \"Scénarios\" ends as it began, with a repetition, the figure of eternal return, the moment where time, which has been the great -if not unique- question of cinema, will have ceased to flow.","popularity":0.1542,"poster_path":"/xkxeIpQMd4Ijgw6ONSbzsjWcEjH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":159466,"logo_path":"/aW6N87zsw1LwIZqeJ2yHVU7IbsB.png","name":"nekojarashi","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":107769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Écran
