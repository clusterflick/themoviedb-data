From kitchen tables to at-home darkrooms, and even the dirt outdoors - these artists are challenging toxic legacies to build a new ecology of photography. An ecology not just of sustainable materials, but the political and social entanglements that arise each time you press the shutter.  Developed in a blend of coffee and home-grown herbs, the film is cut with experimental vignettes showcasing Sustainable Darkroom research. From images developed in household waste to footage printed on waste coffee cups, and pelargonium leaves as a new photographic paper - I AM A DARKROOM welcomes the rough, handmade hands-dirty approach of an ecologically aware future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3oSnfMNtOe99MIe37LTNcVRyoQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228425,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoBeDo Projects","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am A Darkroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edd Carr","original_name":"Edd Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581e2b03a48c50ac3af663b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucy Johnson","original_name":"Lucy Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581e2c1226c5608769ddb3b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3oSnfMNtOe99MIe37LTNcVRyoQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
