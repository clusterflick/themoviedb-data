He got 10 years in the gulag. There he met excellent conductors, theater directors - also political prisoners. Almost 60 years ago, Leontín Dohovič conducted the prisoners' choir for the first time. After the death of Stalin, he too was freed. Together with his mother and three sisters, he came to see his father, who as a priest fled from Ukraine during the war to Czechoslovakia. He founded choirs in Prague, Prešov and Košice. He still conducts today, because there is a force in music that helped him survive.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirigent z gulagu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4207594,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ladislav Csiky","original_name":"Ladislav Csiky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581d7b4226c5607fe9f2f14","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408375,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladislav Hroš","original_name":"Vladislav Hroš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581d7ac02576407fd48ed12","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4207586,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ľuba Koľová","original_name":"Ľuba Koľová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581d791d5191f08f5adaee4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4207586,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ľuba Koľová","original_name":"Ľuba Koľová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581d7a1d5191f08e0adf24a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
