She dreams of a troubling encounter with a man at a futuristic cathedral. In this dream, the proliferation of a day's images is reduced and refined into more enigmatic renderings. The world of color and movement translates into one of stone, shadows and light. In the epilogue, the woman, now awake, lingers over the dream scenario which has just played; she prepares new variations. As such, the film poses the problem of defining the relationship between dreaming and waking consciousness. AURELIA was shot on location in Barcelona, Spain at the unfinished Sagrada Familia church designed by Antonio Gaudi. The film is based in spirit on Gerard de Nerval's novella Aurelia.  â€”Irene Fizer","popularity":0.1309,"poster_path":"/qxGjFDdeWAiexNeEvSiLDAn5bgf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Light Pharmacy Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-04-15","revenue":10000,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A woman sleeps.
