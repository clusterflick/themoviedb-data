Alongside 50 paintings by Sargent sit stunning items of clothing and accessories worn by his subjects, drawing the audience into the artist’s studio. Sargent’s sitters were often wealthy, their clothes costly, but what happens when you turn yourself over to the hands of a great artist? The manufacture of public identity is as controversial and contested today as it was at the turn of the 20th century, but somehow Sargent’s work transcends the social noise and captures an alluring truth with each brush stroke.","popularity":0.6571,"poster_path":"/7Oki8yUeaVwY8BkeL1owoDqkZkW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Exhibition on Screen (GB)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Singer Sargent: Fashion and Swagger","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6582dc57992fe63e36724ea3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Wilkie","original_name":"Amanda Wilkie","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6582dc86e8131d4178a4a988","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bickerstaff","original_name":"David Bickerstaff","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6582dc9af1759c3f5110d319","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30498392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mjKNLt1eb4qMixeAxdXhA5xLMGK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7Oki8yUeaVwY8BkeL1owoDqkZkW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/to2CIybO95hKN4v4pxP38UhVyS2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2384,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/pGM7EEs6HgM5BQWq0GCtlWGivIZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1589},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/3vvZOjTwwtogPcUJehLlBiW7UFk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":15479,"name":"fashion"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":231803,"name":"impressionism"},{"id":303954,"name":"art documentary"},{"id":339978,"name":"john singer sargent"},{"id":339980,"name":"portrait painter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"JOHN SINGER SARGENT: FASHION & SWAGGER | OFFICIAL TRAILER | EXHIBITION ON SCREEN","key":"RT7RSSsfWLY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-01-31T13:24:00.000Z","id":"65c7cc98680be80162a3b545"}]}}}
