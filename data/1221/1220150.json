You come to the Hanseatic city to work. The Polish Agnieszka as the carer of an elderly gentleman with dementia, Dieudonné from the Ivory Coast as a harvest helper on an organic tomato plantation. Agnieszka, who works on behalf of a Catholic placement agency, soon develops a close connection with Siegfried, whose son Carsten, who is rarely present, has little understanding for him. Dieudonné, trapped in the exploitative structures of modern agriculture, communicates primarily through a mysterious network: the Amitié. An artificial intelligence and virtual reality that anyone can join and whose possibilities seem unlimited. When a crazy police officer suspects a smuggling gang is behind the network and Siegfried is picked up by a mysterious taxi, events take over. Science fiction parable that tells with a lot of humor and artistic imagination about the inequality in our society and the hope for a self-determined life in the future.","popularity":0.1194,"poster_path":"/qkCYn6TcpbXo9nhRrIO08nuI3vF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Amitié","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2994485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylwia Gola","original_name":"Sylwia Gola","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/A1QxsRRbFXvZ0LX433o9TUk4LQB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6581bdda34e152086008600c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3554921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yann Mbiene","original_name":"Yann Mbiene","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6581bdecd5191f08a4ae2a4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Hess","original_name":"Walter Hess","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6581bdfd02576407fd48e701","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aziz Çapkurt","original_name":"Aziz Çapkurt","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/c4Xo3ysMTRleXYBDOkBwGaRKLCk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6581be053a48c57c25af6620","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Bach","original_name":"Christoph Bach","popularity":0.3441,"profile_path":"/DjyM6g981W3qiHQZl4PUvjM2OJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6581be0d3a48c57bfeaf6648","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":207811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Stieblich","original_name":"Anna Stieblich","popularity":0.377,"profile_path":"/hrRbEJ3oN79nVuTD5GVzkHWVgtX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6581be162f8d0908f4a89e7f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kollektiv Amitié","original_name":"Kollektiv Amitié","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581be26cedac408457dddca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qkCYn6TcpbXo9nhRrIO08nuI3vF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
