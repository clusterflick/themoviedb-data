Rather, each object is lovingly filmed, as if inviting the artwork to converse with us. Lehmuskallio has discovered how to let his camera speak to the art, and how to let the art reply, and thereby this northern art can speak with us as well.” (Kathleen Osgood, in Uralic Imaginations on Film)","popularity":0.309,"poster_path":"/lA6E9NBCOiRzbMgLEAkie7d7UYi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am – A Film About the Art of People Living in the Tundra: Prehistory and Encounter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markku Lehmuskallio","original_name":"Markku Lehmuskallio","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/3sQSfLimcNSTokkDJFTs0oAQium.jpg","credit_id":"6583278a8586785635f6698b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lA6E9NBCOiRzbMgLEAkie7d7UYi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":855}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
