While he lets his imagination roam freely, the film unfolds through a series of vignettes. With Line of Sight, Ali Eslami manages to find a new way to articulate our inner realm and explore a displaced and fragmented sense of self. The result is as playful as it is frightening.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/aUXRZWqPG9DKqOMdMEZDSBz9M11.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Line of Sight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3783320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Eslami","original_name":"Ali Eslami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65827189b1131f15e9ae6ffa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUXRZWqPG9DKqOMdMEZDSBz9M11.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
