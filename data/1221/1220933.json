And so we come to the greatest DVD of our time. It's called \"Bagpuss: The Director's cut\" and has nothing at all to do with the DVD we're giving away here. No, this is a far shoddier affair featuring, as it does, a documentary, or - if you will - a mockumentary. Revealing how the staff of Superbike manages to cobble together the best sports bike magazine in the world every month.  It's all here - the road tests, the track action, the long-termer bike tests, the centerfold shoots, big Al's baking tips, well, maybe not those but we'll talk about everything else.  Citizen Kane? Battleship Potemkin? Dude, where's my car? They are all unquestionably far, better, films than this - but do they feature some of the finest motorcycles ever built? No, they do not. This DVD will fill in the gaps so disappointingly evident in the works of Messers Wells, Einstein, and Leiner.","popularity":0.3117,"poster_path":"/tVC7v0ExydILzfYsCFciTERjkBj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216567,"logo_path":null,"name":"superbike","origin_country":""},{"id":1103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maverik Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE BIKES, THE TEST, THE GIRLS, THE OFFICE, THE STUPIDITY","title":"Superbike Episode IV - Attack of the Clowns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Pryde","original_name":"Kenny Pryde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65844bc9ca835441f6d7197c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Dowds","original_name":"Alan Dowds","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65844bd9880551422327822b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathon Pearson","original_name":"Jonathon Pearson","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65844be6f1759c40e210b7b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Roots","original_name":"Simon Roots","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65844bf4858678576cf66178","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Handly","original_name":"Neil Handly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65844c0388055140f42811d7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Woolhouse","original_name":"Caroline Woolhouse","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65844c61fbe36f4b2d7f6644","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lorenzo De Antonis","original_name":"Lorenzo De Antonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65844c92f1759c3fd91129b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1182,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tVC7v0ExydILzfYsCFciTERjkBj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1438,"name":"office"},{"id":6241,"name":"stupidity"},{"id":200575,"name":"superbike"},{"id":251645,"name":"motorbike"},{"id":280739,"name":"bikes"},{"id":323721,"name":"girls"},{"id":326485,"name":"tests"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
