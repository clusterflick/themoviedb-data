In the work author and director Martin Willibald Meisl deals with his memories and tries to explore his motivations. - When did the tendency towards self-destructive behavior arise and which ones can be seen? For that, he works with reenactments of artworks such as photos by Joel-Peter Witkin or Michaelangelo’s Pietá. A look at the later consequences of the decision is given. Discrimination, side effects of the therapy, and feelings towards the fresh infection. There is a clear change in his sexuality, and new positions taken.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/87YS3RQidC2jITpKwyBoBIA4qe9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autoaggression","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","original_name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6581cf0a7e403d0925f56f36","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2839143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamal Phoenix","original_name":"Jamal Phoenix","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/zoBs4PUH7COCj55YtTYqsLyRka8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6581cf18226c56083a9ea52e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gellert Gerson Butter","original_name":"Gellert Gerson Butter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6581cf1c3a48c503f5af6660","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","original_name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581ced1ac617c08ec14c955","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","original_name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581ced8cedac408457de230","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","original_name":"Martin Willibald Meisl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581cede8dbc330918994831","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daria Vybornova","original_name":"Daria Vybornova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581cf00bf0f63087562dc74","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/87YS3RQidC2jITpKwyBoBIA4qe9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
