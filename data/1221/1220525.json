The door shows Old and New Testament stages of the events of salvation: from the creation of man to the fratricide of Abel; from the angel's proclamation to Mary to the presentation of Jesus in the temple, the capture of Jesus to the encounter of the risen Christ with Mary Magdalene. Careful camera work - supported by careful lighting - succeeds in doing justice to the monumental size of the work.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":216488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfred Ehrhardt-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":25006,"logo_path":"/ziWQdswTHwQ9V40O4kvhc2DYYBK.png","name":"Institut für Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tausend Jahre nach Christi Geburt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Bronzetür des Bernward von Hildesheim","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Paetsch","original_name":"Hans Paetsch","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":"/zCeXmJ7ff8TkkzT5EM0JN762cVF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6582dfe7e295b43d1d6840b0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1062078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jens Ehrhardt","original_name":"Jens Ehrhardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6582dff7180dea53b98be102","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467419,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alfred Ehrhardt","original_name":"Alfred Ehrhardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6582e035ca83544156d6f4d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
