A chorus of male voices answers her from the castle stair: «We love you». A monotonous yet grotesque litany is created, that acquires a rather neurotic note in being so repetitious. Reduction to two camera settings, which strictly track the two axes of the Baroque interior, enhances the impression. The prologue is a sequence in which a child, also in court dress, leads the viewer into this absurd scenario. In the end banality breaks into the artificially generated tension as ironic relief.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schloss Solitude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1593349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corinna Schnitt","original_name":"Corinna Schnitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c50c4ea0e0a265e19cbdaaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
