The series are transforming and spiritualizing human body by the use of light, or more precisely by the screening of a film directly to the skin. The body is therefore the only screen for the abstract images made from mathematical models. This encounter between body and light produces a particular and creative energy beyond shapes. Lyrical abstraction, mathematical modelisation and sensual exploration of light, this film is the depth perception of the body stridences.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2kbo8efPatlGtxAxfehBnNr4TYn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aldébaran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maud Edelman","original_name":"Maud Edelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c50ac540e0a2662a4cbc437","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Lopez","original_name":"Vanessa Lopez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c50ac83c3a368479395d8cf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Verlinde","original_name":"Hugo Verlinde","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7ao3lkZDkI659cF2Nh9PmfQmmm1.jpg","credit_id":"5c5088369251410e22603f75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon Gibson","original_name":"Jon Gibson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c50ac2fc3a368576a95f532","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z9O9Agprmrn12eDfdigh0CEFVhV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2kbo8efPatlGtxAxfehBnNr4TYn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ch8JcLbcpJMulg9LNLVorwzc6y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eSstV0A72MBRMtcUmeeXFknSVWu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
