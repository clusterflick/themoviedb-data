The villages are finally reconciled by the advice of a wise old man, Baba, who has kept out of all the quarrels that have separated everybody else by retiring to a cave. The character of Baba is based on a real hermit, Baba Firoz, who lived in a cave in Goldara surrounded by tame animals and supposedly lived to be 127 years old.","popularity":0.0529,"poster_path":"/ooZOv9EO4xWrB3QBgyIU2u8Onlz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afghan Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"1989-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salaam Tsangi","original_name":"Salaam Tsangi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4fe8ba9251410e0a5f4fac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wali Talash","original_name":"Wali Talash","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4fe8c09251410e225f5d57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asadullah Aram","original_name":"Asadullah Aram","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4fe8c60e0a2601d6c7832b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ibrahim Tookhyan","original_name":"Ibrahim Tookhyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4fe8cf0e0a264965d9399b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Humayun Pais","original_name":"Humayun Pais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4fe8d592514116fc4ec4fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zarghuna Aram","original_name":"Zarghuna Aram","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4fe8db9251410e0a5f4fec","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juwansher Haidary","original_name":"Juwansher Haidary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4fe89092514116fc4ec4bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juwansher Haidary","original_name":"Juwansher Haidary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4fe88b9251410e245fe38f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229525,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Noor Hashim Abeer","original_name":"Noor Hashim Abeer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4fe89cc3a368479394b372","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229511,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noorullah Multafit","original_name":"Noorullah Multafit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4fe8af92514151a95a3dab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229526,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"M.
