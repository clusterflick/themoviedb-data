The devil Méphistophélès appears and strikes a bargain with the philosopher: he will give him youth and the love of the beautiful Marguerite, if Faust hands over his soul. Faust agrees, and Méphistophélès arranges matters so that Marguerite loses interest in her suitor Siébel and becomes infatuated with Faust.  Faust initially seems to love Marguerite in return, but soon abandons her. Her brother Valentin returns from the war and is furious to find his sister pregnant. Will Faust repent his destructive actions, and can his soul, and Marguerite's, be saved?","popularity":0.376,"poster_path":"/7IgZWn6iAp1kHpoPn590FOzV6KM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gounod's Faust at Royal Opera House","title":"Faust | ROH |","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"FAUSTO OPERA 2019","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"FAUSTO OPERA MEGAOCIO 2019","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fabiano","original_name":"Michael Fabiano","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fausto","credit_id":"5c507fa30e0a26495ada335c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Schrott","original_name":"Erwin Schrott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9UXpnvki0EHDGR5XtWWQvcgDra2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Méphistophélès","credit_id":"5c507fcd92514105c15ccff1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Lungu","original_name":"Irina Lungu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marguerite","credit_id":"5f124deb2afb2500353957d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Degout","original_name":"Stéphane Degout","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Valentin","credit_id":"5f124e0043d9b1003a59b399","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Fontanals-Simmons","original_name":"Marta Fontanals-Simmons","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Siébel","credit_id":"5f124e1443d9b10039588334","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Wilson","original_name":"Carole Wilson","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marthe Schwertlein","credit_id":"5f124e2d43d9b1003a59b3e8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Germán E.
