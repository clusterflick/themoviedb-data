From the backwoods of Baton Rouge to the heart the Big Easy, creole and Cajun music have endured despite years of tumult. This film explores not only the musicians who continue to produce this music, but the climate, culture, and way of life that have shaped them. Innumerable zydeco superstars appear onscreen and deliver legendary performances, including Beau Jocque, D.L. Menard, and Zydeco Joe.","popularity":0.2733,"poster_path":"/pvxNuGi0pKYuSoiIM5tnXXbL10b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agat Films & Compagnie","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louisiana Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2488816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Daigrepont","original_name":"Bruce Daigrepont","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"626f73b00d9f5a009eae468d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2886167,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Doucet","original_name":"Michael Doucet","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"626f73b9903c52152c10b76a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Jocque","original_name":"Beau Jocque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"626f73c468ff700068e11074","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3532861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.L.
