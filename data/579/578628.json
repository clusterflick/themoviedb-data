Here, they listen to spiders, discover black holes, and fight about what is going to steer a flying carpet. Together they search for the answers to life's big questions. But the brutality of the adult world makes itself known when terrorists detonate a bomb in the neighborhood. Aaatos envies Amine's Muslim faith and looks for his own gods, although his classmate Flo questions him; she is strongly convinced that anyone who believes in God is completely nuts. Gods of Molenbeek is a wonderful portrayal of childhood friendship, inquiry and the creation of meaning in a chaotic time.","popularity":0.2526,"poster_path":"/AvTUv7CvuuwqO69cmZH9JPpXing.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94771,"logo_path":"/e9TrCyThYq5qIs4OGkMQF40HDzX.png","name":"Zone2
