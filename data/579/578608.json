The film was conceived from the directorâ€™s connections to his parents and companions as they went through states of sickness, impending death, dementia, grief and temporary insanity. At the same time, it echoes the turbulent years of political upheavals and repercussions in Thailand, resulting in a nation in a state of delirium, lunacy and trauma.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/swDqUBma2q80YE16OfJFcgiFkZ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mental Traveller","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taiki Sakpisit","original_name":"Taiki Sakpisit","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hSQ4bWI6m78j0hVcDkqtpjPVA4U.jpg","credit_id":"5c4f41a10e0a264965d82622","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taiki Sakpisit","original_name":"Taiki Sakpisit","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hSQ4bWI6m78j0hVcDkqtpjPVA4U.jpg","credit_id":"5f8c93ac397df00038579623","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13322266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swDqUBma2q80YE16OfJFcgiFkZ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International FIlm Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
