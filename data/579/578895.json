It’s a powerful denunciation, but not so deft and subtle as Debord’s films, perhaps because it was made during the worsening stages of his final illness. Presumably intended as a parting shot at the society he detested, it was completed shortly before his death in November 1994 and shown January 9, 1995, on a French cable channel along with La Société du Spectacle and Réfutation de tous les jugements (whence the video copies that have since circulated).","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/rgQC6vsDb1lMjFI7lBQKPCLErTy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guy Debord, son art et son temps","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigitte Cornand","original_name":"Brigitte Cornand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c50cea90e0a265e19cbee58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Debord","original_name":"Guy Debord","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff52b38e78687003d416287","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0481855","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rgQC6vsDb1lMjFI7lBQKPCLErTy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
