He carefully toned down the political satire here, switching his target to intellectuals instead of bureaucrats. The main character, Li Shaobai, is a rude literary critic who goes to a conference to lecture about satirical literature. Li is absolutely full of himself, and constantly misunderstands other people. Like Before the New Director Arrives, The Man Who Doesn’t Bother about Trifles was greeted with plenty of positive responses. Still, while Lu tried to be more careful with this second short, this didn’t stop some critics from taking issue with its ridiculous main character and humor.","popularity":0.1564,"poster_path":"/afC3QmwfD07sMHJu1oCF2H6VgSa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changchun Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1956-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Did Not Bother With Trifles","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"A Man Regardless of Trivial Matters","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mu Bai","original_name":"Mu Bai","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/dzJMXjR7yxfDW1kZke5qoZH0SvY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4f1a11c3a368477a94e87c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1412877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huang Wansu","original_name":"Huang Wansu","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/yyu9vIsr7NHubYYcLnG5bINBlhI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4f1a2292514151a959027a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4279264,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ma Lin","original_name":"Ma Lin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65090753fa27f400ae9fb9cf","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4279264,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ma Lin","original_name":"Ma Lin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650907448261ee0139672353","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lü Ban","original_name":"Lü Ban","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/g1xU89QKQo8lASiLmk1XHSCOzMz.jpg","credit_id":"5c4f19ce0e0a264965d7ec0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12690054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6NV6s3zMjJ6WJLrb3GU45v4xrzN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/afC3QmwfD07sMHJu1oCF2H6VgSa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1956-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
