It is the tale of a hyperactive, temperamental artist whose talent and determination propelled the project, even as his ego and obsession threatened to tear it apart. It is the story of hucksterism and hyperbole, of a massive public works project in the midst of an economic depression. And it is the story of dozens of ordinary Americans who suddenly found themselves suspended high on a cliff face with drills and hammers as a Danish sculptor they considered insane directed them in the creation what some would call a monstrosity, and others a masterpiece.","popularity":0.3939,"poster_path":"/bctNhDCwkXo9ajWOXlNsXfAAHZ2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mount Rushmore","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gutzon Borglum","original_name":"Gutzon Borglum","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fHUoLd2btlHkEQnKlxYpgM3UxlG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c50101e0e0a26495ad98cc6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Zwonitzer","original_name":"Mark Zwonitzer","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c501066c3a3684777958075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Zwonitzer","original_name":"Mark Zwonitzer","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5010700e0a2612cccdaeee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0405514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m3vomrFf2TFnnxaqJypzYuzirak.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1704,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bctNhDCwkXo9ajWOXlNsXfAAHZ2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1136}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
