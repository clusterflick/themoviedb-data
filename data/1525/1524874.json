This is Fletcher, who will soon meet the Motoa brothers to gather more information about what happened. However, Fletcher is kidnapped by a group of narco-guerrillas, who torture and interrogate him about his alleged connection with a communist insurgent named Tomás. Fletcher knows he has reached what he calls \"The Deathroom.\" He knows that very few live to tell of this experience, and that his chances of getting out alive are slim. From weakness and desperation, strength and the most incredible plan will emerge to save himself. Will he manage to survive, as fantastic as it may sound?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zNUgNGATg9c05LXnDswx0LQ2TYu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hamilton's Films","origin_country":""},{"id":270091,"logo_path":null,"name":"CineUpdate","origin_country":""},{"id":138065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmos Fan Comunicación","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He was just looking for the Truth...
