Cutting right angle donuts on a dime  and stopping right at my Birkenstocks,  and me yelping..  Like I woke up in Wonderland, all sort of terrifying And can anyone tell me why you all sound like Peanuts parents? Will I ever be coming down?\"  The filming itself was essentially a visual improvisation, an exploratory performance by Tina YounesTabar in 1402 (2023). It was captured through images taken during dawn, at a time when a Banana was splitting the sky in two. In the editing process, these fragments were woven together to become the film you see today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6FLxIMgwg1zKeS5y9vM6yIYQ9o2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spiral Spectrum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2025-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When a Flaming Stealth Banana Split The Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4322296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Younestabaar","original_name":"Tina Younestabaar","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"688e396edab4fb09eaa4626b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4672349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bardia Mashhoodi","original_name":"Bardia Mashhoodi","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/snhDFWCzk6uodifvXuNyhEjXN6N.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"688e397b899f40efdf7cf030","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e3992743594bb18f3dd54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e39a3b3903623a6b22a82","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e39b96cb9f2b886f3debb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e43f853862245da11d67e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":765,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6FLxIMgwg1zKeS5y9vM6yIYQ9o2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
