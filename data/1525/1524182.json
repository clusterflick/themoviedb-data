Yang is white, hard, hot, masculine, and active, and Yin is black, dark, soft, cold, feminine, and passive. In Greek mythology, the male symbol is a bull, and the female in German legends, a snail. A predominant male transforms a man into a beast, a raging bull. A predominant female transforms into a cowardly snail. Only the balance of Yin and Yang leads to a harmonious personality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yin and Yang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5602348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Guse","original_name":"Olga Guse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688e42cde85e91436ef3de2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
