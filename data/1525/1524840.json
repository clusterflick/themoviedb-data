When Caesar (Christophe Dumaux) comes to Egypt on the hunt for his enemy Pompey, he discovers that the pharaoh Ptolemy (Yuriy Mynenko) has beaten him to the punch, setting Pompey's son Sextus (Federico Fiorio) on a mission for vengeance — all while Ptolemy's sister Cleopatra (Olga Kulchynska) schemes to take the throne for herself, leading her directly into the path of Caesar… This tale of uncompromising rivalries and the corrupting thrall of political power is animated by one of Handel's finest scores, majestic in the hands of expert Baroque ensemble Le Concert d'Astrée under their celebrated founder Emmanuelle Haïm.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lvsqvn5WzTBdFULXzSSXRAwTo4v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Salzburg
