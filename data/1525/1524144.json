It is a free reinterpretation of intimate records that  are both fleeting and subtle. The film delves into the confrontation between these records, in an inner ethnography, which departs from memories and the story of two women who built their whole lives around the sea. Or rather, turned their lives into the sea.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curtas-Metragens, CRL","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catraias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1530036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tânia Dinis","original_name":"Tânia Dinis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pXW2Y2XWea6Tk0hWrCROuynrqcV.jpg","credit_id":"688e2dcfe0da2462c2261588","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
