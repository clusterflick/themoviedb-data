Each day, he handles memories that aren't his: names, dates, and phrases that sum up lives he never lived. His craft gives visible form to others' memories, helping preserve stories that might fade away. Through each commission, he confronts not only others' farewells, but his own. As he engraves what others wish to keep, he waits for a story that might one day name him.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm Waiting for You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","title":"I'm Waiting for You","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Pimienta Barquín","original_name":"Guillermo Pimienta Barquín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"688fba3d0667fffd8f7cf699","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Díaz Roa","original_name":"Camila Díaz Roa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fbaa0cd114ef50061f1c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Díaz Roa","original_name":"Camila Díaz Roa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fbaba0e3850f38c261968","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Díaz Roa","original_name":"Camila Díaz Roa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fbace71cd58ca54de6bad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danilo Nunes do Carmo","original_name":"Danilo Nunes do Carmo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fbae3e9e976b25cde6b82","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3789859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glauber Lacerda","original_name":"Glaura Lacerda","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fbb26518ee41a71a468d4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767486,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henrique Chiurciu","original_name":"Henrique Chiurciu","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fbb4b94684b9b457cf508","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
