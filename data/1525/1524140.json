Ships sail off, people stay ashore waiting. Something unexpected occurs. A ship collides with a small boat, which capsizes after being hit by a wave. There are cries, men stuck in the hold, fishermen are out in the cold days on end crammed in a dinghy. On shore, people are crying after having heard the news, they're preparing for mourning, and they are waiting for a ray of sunshine that could maybe bring live people. The dates won't be forgotten, and the scars stay in the body and mind of those who experienced it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shipwrecked","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Neves","original_name":"Pedro Neves","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/IDZ8fSWHojSjJ6AFGfI2N12Rq9.jpg","credit_id":"688e2ac3e9e976b25cde6563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29765741","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Curtas Vila do Conde","release_date":"2018-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
