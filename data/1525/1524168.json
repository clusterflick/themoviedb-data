It was shot with an old JVC Handycam, during a autumn sunset when the sun spilled its deepest crimson hues over the leaves...  During that period, a live version of Swans' track \"I Am Tower\" was playingâ€”an echo that accompanied the filming process. The cinematographer listened attentively, striving to find a portal into another realm of perception, amidst the rhythmic dance of music, light, and leaves.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jZBbm7rlZ7Jm3vjKrFYraF2wiep.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spiral Spectrum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2025-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MY PHANTOM LIMB","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e3b7f282b8cb50db22926","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e3b986cb9f2b886f3dec2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3250182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soheil Chivaee","original_name":"Soheil Chivaee","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/pPb1H8HIusePoIEGDF9bKGA75If.jpg","credit_id":"688e3ba02da5aef65fb7ed13","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jZBbm7rlZ7Jm3vjKrFYraF2wiep.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
