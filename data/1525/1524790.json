On the verge of ending her life, she chooses creation instead. With a camera in hand, she begins documenting the spaces once filled with love—from the quiet corners of her home to the vibrant streets of Old Delhi. As memory and reality blur, Ila reflects on queerness, invisibility, and the paradox of being seen. Through this intimate journey, she confronts grief and reclaims identity, ultimately culminating in a final, transformative gesture: a dance before the lens—not an end, but a beginning.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5Fvh1gBefwGlzK9UGz2qf19ym28.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life begins where it ends.","title":"The Last Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sunita Singh","original_name":"Sunita Singh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fc558dab4fb09eaa468ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sunita Singh","original_name":"Sunita Singh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fc55fb3419ca7da7cf6d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604772,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vinit Gupta","original_name":"Vinit Gupta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fc571899f40efdf7cf548","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37563499","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5Fvh1gBefwGlzK9UGz2qf19ym28.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
