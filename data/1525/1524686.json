Within, Joe 90, a crop insurance claims adjuster, is quickly persuaded by the annoying paranoid Dick Rotundo to conspire in a false insurance claim. They almost close the deal when Dick's uncontrollable paranoia forces him to run into a burning field. Believing Dick is dead, Joe 90 is left to face his supervisor without a claimant. He avoids her for fear of being caught in the process of a false claim. Much to his surprise, Joe 90 discovers that Dick is alive. The two conspirators can now complete the fraudulent claim. This time Dick cannot free himself from the guilt and his fate blows in the wind. He helplessly watches as Joe offers him a place in a corrupt future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe 90","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gottli","original_name":"Michael Gottli","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Joe 90","credit_id":"688f962a35be685e38b7f271","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1701258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Russ Dyck","original_name":"Russ Dyck","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f91f3cd114ef50061f126","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604436,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Marshall","original_name":"Michael Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f92b608fd94bb60261958","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
