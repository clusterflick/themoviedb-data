For over 300 years, Russian Old Believers have lived there, whose ancestors once fled Russia to save their faith from the new church reform of Patriarch Nikon in the second half of the 17th century. How do these people manage to preserve the Russian spirit in themselves for so many centuries, far from Russia? What do they consider their homeland: the country where they were born, or the one that is in each person’s soul? And what is a homeland? Residents of the village of Sariköy reflect on these and other topics.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Сочинение о Родине","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sochinenie o Rodine","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5604952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alisa Kurganskaya","original_name":"Алиса Курганская","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iTioMhDMuSVJZK36n5FOguyA5Kk.jpg","credit_id":"688fd64324f18fded3b22d53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326936,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexey Sashin","original_name":"Алексей Сашин","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/h5Xldu0QQzRc5ydQr2sxfCANhw9.jpg","credit_id":"688fd64b42c7ca9f97a465ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2734001,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrey Dontsov","original_name":"Андрей Донцов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fd6659cf7ff713bb7f114","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5604953,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Usachev","original_name":"Александр Усачев","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fd66fa3a4424a8ab7f1cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":631718,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergey Zernov","original_name":"Сергей Зернов","popularity":0.6708,"profile_path":"/aK5mYxZvQ5UdCwFI9n3HD7HooVI.jpg","credit_id":"688fd67972165d6b0ef3e59d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5604954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Artur Gezerov","original_name":"Артур Гезеров","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688fd683a3a4424a8ab7f1d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"St. Anna Open Film Festival of Student and Debut Films","release_date":"2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
