Deep in decaying forest, a Clown watches from the dark. His victims aren’t random—they're teenagers filming dangerous pranks for laughs, taglines like “this one’s for the trolls.” This Clown doesn’t speak. He waits. Bodies are found with shredded bumper-stickers, and cameras still rolling. The few survivors must decode why laughing is lethal—and outwit a silent killer bent on cleansing frivolity… one blood-spattered laugh at a time. Some things are not ment to be for shits and giggles.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There’s fooling around with this clown","title":"Shits And Giggles","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
