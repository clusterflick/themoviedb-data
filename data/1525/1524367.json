Originally from Northern Manchester, Stephen faced many challenges throughout his upbringing, including personal loss and family struggles. Despite discovering his artistic talent early on, he also became involved in a life of crime. It culminated in 1996, when he was given 30 years for importing class 'A' drugs. His stories about his involvement in the trafficking of millions of pounds and hundreds of kilos of cocaine with Turkish, Albanian, and Colombian crime groups beggars belief. Stephen served sixteen and a half years in prison. His life took a turn during his time in prison, where he pursued his passion for fine arts, leading to a transformative experience. He has now established himself as a professional artist, drawing inspiration from both his past and present experiences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bus Driver: Britain’s Cocaine King","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
