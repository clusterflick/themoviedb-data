In an electrifying blue tone and hand-processed, the film reveals intimate moments of a couple at the table, caught in repetitions of media clich√©s of tenderness. Structural repetition and changing perspectives intensify the tension of waiting. The film switches to the male perspective in front of the mirror, followed by intimate scenes that address loneliness and unfulfilled desire.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1987-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What is the true nature of a woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Schillinger","original_name":"Claudia Schillinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"688f7031a3a4424a8ab7f09b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Schillinger","original_name":"Claudia Schillinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f701a899f40efdf7cf3ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Schillinger","original_name":"Claudia Schillinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f7025312d38eebeb7f01f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Internationale Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen","release_date":"1987-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
