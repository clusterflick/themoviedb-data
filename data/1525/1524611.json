Hermes, a self-proclaimed pederast, shares his experiences and reflections in a video verite interview, expressing his desire to connect with boys before puberty and his struggle with societal judgment. His narration, voiced by an actor for anonymity, covers themes of self-justification, guilt, and childhood memories. The filmmaker’s questions about desire create a mirror effect, highlighting the adult’s longing to be the child they once were. Hermes also recounts the loss of his younger brothers, taken away due to fears of them becoming gay, hinting at a past sexual encounter with them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/g85i8UXo1fMtE2ob0xwtUIZIVuw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hermes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5604189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Zufall","original_name":"Jörg Zufall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"688f72186fd7bd326cf3e3ad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Schillinger","original_name":"Claudia Schillinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f722661a7ed9dbb26183a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1894,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g85i8UXo1fMtE2ob0xwtUIZIVuw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1263}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hamburg International Short Film Festival (NoBudget Competition)","release_date":"1995-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
