He receives a visit from Luis, his best friend, who invites him on a journey to the Peruvian highlands to cover a strange event taking place during the Internal Armed Conflict. It’s the opportunity they’ve been waiting for—to use journalism as a tool for social change and a means to uncover the truth in a time of terror and uncertainty. Despite the fear and the risk, Beto accepts the challenge, driven by his commitment to the truth. However, upon arriving in the conflict zone, the team is warned of the dangers they face. In the midst of the chaos, they are mistaken for terrorists and sentenced to death by an Andean community.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Upallay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5605230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Guzmán","original_name":"Alejandro Guzmán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Beto","credit_id":"689001b2b3903623a6b23313","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anibal Lozano Herrera","original_name":"Anibal Lozano Herrera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6890023e35e691b3db61f078","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5605212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Márquez","original_name":"Javier Márquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688ffdea3d2e6e8393de6cc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
