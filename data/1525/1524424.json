At night, she is often seen at a local Tokyo bar, which has become a safe haven from her stressful job. After a few too many drinks, Tamami begins to feel as if she is invincible, but the hangover afterward begs to differ.  One such night ends on a disparate note when an intoxicated Tamami hears some familiar chords playing on the record player, bringing tears to her eyes as she recalls bygone years. The melody reminds her of a shy pianist named Rin Kajitaniâ€”a boy who was once the closest friend she ever had.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Love Tokyo: He's Playing Our Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
