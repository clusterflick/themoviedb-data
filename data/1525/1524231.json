The keys SI 1st octave and DO 2nd octave were broken and the piano tuner Tony Mobarak was evacuated with the Canadian community in Lebanon due to the July Israeli aggressions.  Since the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1992 we were living a transit period of reconstruction and rehabilitation, a period of a fragile peace so prosperous and promising it was and yet so unstable. Since then we lived the illusion of wellbeing that masked a fear of an upcoming dramatic collapse. We lived a harmonious sonata practicum abrupt by some broken piano keys.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/O4rR50y9OXhONjKJSxyctl0JFe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a short video by Hassan Choubassi performed by the conservatory student Nathalie Choubassi","title":"I am well and surviving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5602528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Choubassi","original_name":"Natalie Choubassi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"688e513a312d38eebeb7ebd1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5602279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hassan Choubassi","original_name":"Hassan Choubassi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jVFdKeLcuzPpvtCbl4iutp7Epzc.jpg","credit_id":"688e514ff7452194f911d54b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5602279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hassan Choubassi","original_name":"Hassan Choubassi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jVFdKeLcuzPpvtCbl4iutp7Epzc.jpg","credit_id":"688e51660667fffd8f7cf0ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7RQu2itX3WhyqBMLO0kS1ociUzm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/O4rR50y9OXhONjKJSxyctl0JFe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
