Cabbar is the last representative of a tradition of dhikr (remembrance of God) that dates back to the Ottoman era. His only weapons in his battle with the demonic realm are his talismanic armor and powerful dhikr. Ignoring his lawyer's warnings, Hasan moves into the mansion he has inherited. Soon, his daughter Elif hears children's whispers in the middle of the night, and his wife Esma sees bloody silhouettes. As the curtain of mystery in Number 303 is lifted, Cabbar will pay a heavy price for his struggle to save his family.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zikir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37392919","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
