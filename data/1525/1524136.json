During this period he established a friendship of growing complicity with fisherman António Escaleira. In a somewhat solitary process and with great passion and commitment he documented the fishing arts, the mastering of the tides, the craftsmanship and the everyday life of this man from Azenhas do Mar. An urban gaze over a man of a seafaring town, tells us a story of above all else an improbable friendship.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Se o Mar Deixar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Alves de Matos","original_name":"Luís Alves de Matos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688e283f0d06d6fc3a11d4b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12678262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CineMar","release_date":"2022-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
