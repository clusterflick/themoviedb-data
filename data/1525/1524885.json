As the days go by—filled with trips to the sea, games, and quiet moments—Sofía begins to sense the absences, the decline, and the slow approach of death in her surroundings. In a home where the adults are also struggling to stay afloat, she tries to make sense of love, farewell, and the passing of time. Hopefully the Sun Will Rise Tomorrow is an intimate portrait of the end of childhood and the first encounters with life’s fragility.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AvwB8wbHnJ9MSYeQKmJiqsShBlL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ojalá mañana salga el sol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5605261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flavia Rodríguez","original_name":"Flavia Rodríguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sofía","credit_id":"689004a33d2e6e8393de6cdd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Palacios","original_name":"Rodrigo Palacios","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/A7n69bkFS27Mw3Ne7kuFOaqPqAW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aldo","credit_id":"689004b7ef31e50002b7f521","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vania Accinelli","original_name":"Vania Accinelli","popularity":0.1408,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"689004df27936ea2e911dd1b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5605266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valeria Calmet","original_name":"Valeria Calmet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689004ef0441cb35fd11dcc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5605266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valeria Calmet","original_name":"Valeria Calmet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68900525eaa4f306e07cfa44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1603915,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chino Pinto","original_name":"Chino Pinto","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689005483d2e6e8393de6ceb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1773299,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karin Zielinski","original_name":"Karin Zielinski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fLnKQKnkRstbMhrmJcx1BDLPXmL.jpg","credit_id":"6890088d65d7348aeeb22d93","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AvwB8wbHnJ9MSYeQKmJiqsShBlL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
