Her friend, Princess Bernadette, crowned Lily as Princess Julia. Despite being dressed as a princess, Lily remained in shorts, indistinguishable from a boy. To escape the vampire Belfighor, they cut their palms to mix their blood, saving themselves. As they left hand in hand, Lily felt truly happy, though her hand still hurt. Cartoon characters Bernadette and Lily, holding hands, were depicted with Bernadette in a short green dress and Lily as a tomboy.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernadette und Belfighor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504194,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lily Besilly","original_name":"Lily Besilly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f77eba3a4424a8ab7f0bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504194,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lily Besilly","original_name":"Lily Besilly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688f77f11881a0c10311db59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
