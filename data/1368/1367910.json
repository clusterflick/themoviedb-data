The film is based on the actual transcript of the nine-day Mohawk Council, highlighting the traditional ways of restorative justice and conflict resolution within the community.  Six Strings is a short film produced by Tsi Tyónnheht Onkwawén:na (TTO) and directed by Bawaadan Collective, shot over two weeks in the late summer of 2021 entirely in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory with actors from the community. The film is only available in the Mohawk language, purposefully with no English subtitles as TTO’s mission is to revitalize the language. Bringing the film to life meant lots of time spent consulting with various museums and people who hold knowledge about wampum and traditions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":241139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bawaadan Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six Strings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bawaadan Collective","original_name":"Bawaadan Collective","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67049ca4222ead1edabffc79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
