With national borders closed due to COVID-19 and physical barriers solidified between their real-world lives, these four, who are among “the first generation whose playgrounds are online,” seek new places to meet and have endless conversations about the way they each move through the world. The ground they stand on is connected by their shared experiences of discrimination and oppression as women born and raised in East Asia, but when they walk and talk with each other’s avatars, there is also a sense of the power of friendship and laughter to overcome depression and anxiety. Teleporting shows the ways that people can hold each other’s hands and cross any boundary. ","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teleporting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
