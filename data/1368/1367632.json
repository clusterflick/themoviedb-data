Filmed in 2013 and now released on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time, the production stars one of the foremost prima ballerinas in the world today, Diana Vishneva. Recently described by The Telegraph as being 'as close to physical and technical perfection as it is possible to be', Vishneva delivers a dazzling performance, and is conducted by leading Prokofiev interpreter, Valery Gergiev. Ratmansky is the world s most influential ballet-maker, credited with revitalising classical dance through a series of highly individual productions. He breathes new life into Prokofiev s ballet, weaving together an array of different styles and echoing the complexities of the composer s score.","popularity":0.1422,"poster_path":"/3RiXwRmCkOa9tca04w4tnxOhlxT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prokofiev:
