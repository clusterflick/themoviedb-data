What constitutes a perfect life and how do ideas, longings and desires meet a consumer-oriented society that is always striving for better?

Between offers such as mommy fitness classes, the perfect wedding pictures or the smartly designed family SUV, they deal with role and gender images and the expectations that come along with them.  WE WANT MORE IN THE LAND OF UNICORNS is the narrative of a journey that invites the audience together with the filmmakers to reflect on gender roles, perfection, competition, the good life and what it
