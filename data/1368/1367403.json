A man climbs a tree to collect wood, hunts animals at night and knows his way miles deep into the jungle. An archaic tree sits silent, high as the sky, absorbing the darker spirits of the forest and preserving the natural balance of the community.  For more than 25 years, the community has been faced with the proposed construction of an airport, a National pride project that would involve displacement and deforestation. Tangia Basti has no electricity, nor running water or telephone connection but has always resisted, building roads and schools with tenacity, enjoying a lively existence.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Search the Secret of the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4985317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pietro Lo Casto","original_name":"Pietro Lo Casto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67038860508dfa7ba3794827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
