The project features testimony from four victims and first responders, who witnessed the massacre and its aftermath: a farmer who helped rescue young people, a young survivor of the Nova music festival who took refuge in a shelter only to witness friends being murdered, an ultra-orthodox musician who volunteered to identify victims, and a mother whose son was kidnapped and taken to Gaza. A sentence uttered by the musician, who had seen 100 dead bodies in a single day, was the inspiration behind the title.","popularity":0.3359,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":239839,"logo_path":"/2ZzqmXCXNvdGi5lkCCORKFYH2T5.png","name":"Fremantle","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even the Walls Cry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dror Moreh","original_name":"Dror Moreh","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6703aac5cc904f12d9138c26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4985478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uri Shinar","original_name":"Uri Shinar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6703aadf18a8b49d32138bcd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4985482,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abot Hameiri","original_name":"Abot Hameiri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6703ab18537446e220794d07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":243321,"name":"hamas terrorist group"},{"id":337708,"name":"october 7th"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
