In the week-long public art project he expresses his idiosyncratic, wry humour in a variety of surprising media.  Among his creations, there's been a cartoon on a building banner for Manchester about bullying, saying: \"The bully has a brain the size of a pea\"; a horde of people with sandwich boards about Tony Blair's current political issues which gathered outside the Guildhall in London, where the Prime Minister was making a speech; a giant mobile billboard parked at the Tory hustings in Leicester with the rallying cry \"Legalise pottery\"; and a giant wearing the slogan \"Binge drinking is our heritage\" visited bars in Nottingham.","popularity":0.1983,"poster_path":"/u0r5Hy4zVKIejYEZuIaRLXX1VFZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spin by David Shrigley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Langham","original_name":"Chris Langham","popularity":0.4053,"profile_path":"/nBMD5a0XVnk8DQbj7yTjRXX5NHc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self as Narrator","credit_id":"6703b87a174a1d577379530b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Shrigley","original_name":"David Shrigley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6703b88918a8b49d32138f05","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hall","original_name":"Peter Hall","popularity":0.3336,"profile_path":"/c6g5T2lQ3eopgwz3ofrWTbPa7EI.jpg","credit_id":"6703b89ca5f29f43a573e2cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3405856,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucy Hooper","original_name":"Lucy Hooper","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6703b8c6174a1d5773795322","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33707008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u0r5Hy4zVKIejYEZuIaRLXX1VFZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
