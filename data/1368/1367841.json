With unusual creativity, the chef transforms the sink into his work area, where a unique culinary process begins: instead of cooking, he uncooks. He takes some cooked noodles and, by dipping them in boiling water, returns them to their raw state. This process culminates when the chef presents his final work to a terrifying customer, revealing his mastery of reverse culinary art that defies all expectations.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/htZbHJ11TuGYk77gzns5JEQugBj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gotham
