It began as a quota reform movement in early June 2024, led by university students, after the Bangladesh Supreme Court invalidated the government's 2018 circular regarding job quotas in the public sector. The movement escalated into a full-fledged mass uprising after the government carried out mass killings of protesters, known as July massacre, by the late of July. By early August, the movement evolved into a non-cooperation movement, ultimately leading to the ouster of the then-Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh to India.","popularity":0.0724,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":172489,"logo_path":"/a5TEqpvEhsR5aSXfuB91LWiN2iv.png","name":"Alpha-i","origin_country":"BD"},{"id":157210,"logo_path":"/5PnqIRUbdpW53V4p56NGxY9lYYB.png","name":"Chorki","origin_country":"BD"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"2025-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Untitled 2024 Anti-discrimination Students Movement Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2139323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raihan Rafi","original_name":"Raihan Rafi","popularity":0.4672,"profile_path":"/mmJAGzMuf4be130W0ZQZY3jxHBe.jpg","credit_id":"6702ed2cfa3e69e0ef7d4eba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2534477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Redoan Rony","original_name":"Redoan Rony","popularity":0.2567,"profile_path":"/wFMlTRnWbTBgjVJajXjBlTxLVRO.jpg","credit_id":"6702ee33fa3e69e0ef7d4f2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3886104,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shahriar Shakil","original_name":"Shahriar Shakil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/67S0UuPeKBV3OTPq9yHp3MilHrZ.jpg","credit_id":"6702ee46f3495d72c4f7cf39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2139323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raihan Rafi","original_name":"Raihan Rafi","popularity":0.4672,"profile_path":"/mmJAGzMuf4be130W0ZQZY3jxHBe.jpg","credit_id":"6702eed4c9a10d46ea7d6176","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
