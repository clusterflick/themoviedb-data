To clean them up, Gandy removes their fleas with a vacuum cleaner labeled \"Flea Internment Camp\". While the rest go through exercises and drilling, the puppy isn't big enough, so he's washed out. Moping around the beach, he sees a German submarine land and three fat pig Nazis emerge, one looking like Hitler. The pup alerts Sourpuss and the dogs, and a shootout ensues, the Nazis holed up in a shack. They toss out a bomb, but our hero tosses it back, blowing up the structure, and leaving the pigs as three hams with a swastika imprints. The pooch is truly patriotic, and gets a flag-waving medal ceremony.","popularity":0.1467,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patriotic Pooches","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Rasinski","original_name":"Connie Rasinski","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702ecf7925fdf925b7d5559","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/k6IX2V57VJ7kZGUdxlzvnbe0njF.jpg","credit_id":"6702ed0efa3e69e0ef7d4eae","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isadore Klein","original_name":"Isadore Klein","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6702ed20fa3e69e0ef7d4eb2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
