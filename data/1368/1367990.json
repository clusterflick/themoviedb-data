Although the advanced cancer diagnosis was a heavy blow, Alfonso didn’t give up his active life and dedicated even more energy to cycling, a passion he discovered at 44.  Since his diagnosis, he has competed in UCI events in Coimbra, a world cycling championship in Glasgow in 2023, and the Spanish and Andalusian championships. His children, Francisco and Verónica, are also cyclists, and she started riding to support her father.  Three years later, Alfonso remains full of life and motivation. He rides about 60 kilometers a day, except on chemotherapy days, which are every two weeks. The physical exhaustion from the treatment, he says, fades away as he pedals on the road.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/kGk7GWE9f57JHBaLXzD78pujBoJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somos, Estamos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4987998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfonso Salido Zambrana","original_name":"Alfonso Salido Zambrana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6704f8555c00a2d44ec00de4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4987999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verónica Salido","original_name":"Verónica Salido","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6704f863ccbb4e7f1669c886","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Ruzafa","original_name":"María Ruzafa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6704f8a45ae01d090e1d43c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Salido","original_name":"Francisco Salido","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6704f8fc5ae01d090e1d43e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paco Malagón","original_name":"Paco Malagón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cirujano","credit_id":"6704f90d5c00a2d44ec00e21","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Montes Sánchez","original_name":"Pablo Montes Sánchez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6704f9755ae01d090e1d43f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Álvaro Montes Sánchez","original_name":"Álvaro Montes Sánchez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6704f9915ae01d090e1d43fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2544806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Débora Vargas","original_name":"Débora Vargas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/sKSiiVK5PKbEcw1v9Iwrv4RhEkE.jpg","credit_id":"6704fadfccbb4e7f1669c99e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988011,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sheila Mera","original_name":"Sheila Mera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6704faecccbb4e7f1669c9a9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Poderoso","original_name":"Andrea Poderoso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670501a1222ead1edac0095c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4357550,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristian Tormo Navarro","original_name":"Cristian Tormo Navarro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670501bf322d3ea8311d48f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"José Javier Delgado Pulpillo","original_name":"José Javier Delgado Pulpillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670501d65ae01d090e1d4518","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1556,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGk7GWE9f57JHBaLXzD78pujBoJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1108}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
