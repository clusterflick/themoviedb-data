For a few thousand francs, the company offered to store their newborn’s umbilical cord blood, an insurance policy against more than 80 illnesses, a safeguard for the future. But behind the brochures lay marketing schemes, hidden commissions, and a lack of oversight. In 2019, Cryosave abruptly went bankrupt. Without notifying its clients, the company quietly transferred over 300,000 stem cell samples to a lab in Poland. Since then, many parents have been fighting to recover what they believed was safely stored.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jQeSyYwBbfWFJ551FzdQjHgebYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Point Prod","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":269236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arte GEIE - Strasbourg","origin_country":""},{"id":269595,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE (FR)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2025-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Cells","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Stammzellen - Der Deal mit der Hoffnung","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatjana Petakovic","original_name":"Tatjana Petakovic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - client","credit_id":"68d5dd5d1a1de4ff0090ab53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Daniel","original_name":"Luis Daniel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - client of Cryo-Save","credit_id":"68d5e1ba786c681b3090ab25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Amar","original_name":"Frédéric Amar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Cryo-Save C.E.O.","credit_id":"68d5db72900022702dc832d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Jacques Carrier","original_name":"Jean Jacques Carrier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - intendant for Frédéric Amar","credit_id":"68d5dbfa116b5df732c48166","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimiliano Seregni","original_name":"Massimiliano Seregni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - lawyer","credit_id":"68d5e05fcf8fe91158095c21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3870904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jakub Baran","original_name":"Jakub Baran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self - FamiCord C.E.O.
