Known only as ‘Disease X’, it is shrouded in uncertainty. Its origin is unknown, how it could spread is unclear, but its impact could be much more severe than Covid-19. To uncover what Disease X might be, where it could emerge and what traits it needs to spread, Chris follows the paths of past deadly viruses. He visits the ground zero of the Nipah virus in Malaysia, which inspired the film Contagion. He also heads to the front line of the ongoing bird flu outbreak in US dairy cattle in California.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75600,"logo_path":"/qvDku9orSiMgA1vIragz227hul8.png","name":"STV Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disease X: Hunting the Next Pandemic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr Chris van Tulleken","original_name":"Dr Chris van Tulleken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"68d658d7b41b98b58d095dbc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emeka Onono","original_name":"Emeka Onono","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d658fc34938bdd49095def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Craig Hunter","original_name":"Craig Hunter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d65919cf8fe91158095d9c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005780,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Redshaw","original_name":"John Redshaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d6592f21d6f81a1368ae6d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3721,"name":"health"},{"id":188973,"name":"pandemic"},{"id":336151,"name":"pandemic technologies"},{"id":359433,"name":"pandemic research"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
