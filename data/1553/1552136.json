Evicted, he climbed onto his roof in protest, remaining there for years. Rick on the Roof uses candid interviews and archive to reveal how his quiet neighbourhood transformed into a thriving community. Neighbours threw street parties and rallied around Rick through storms, until he was injured under mysterious circumstances. Amidst the backdrop of today’s cost of living crisis, the town reflects on Rick’s extraordinary defiance. This bittersweet documentary tells the peculiar story of one man on a roof who inspired and united a working-class Welsh community.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124380,"logo_path":"/ixl5eB1t9AJmjhmtvF3c8YJIrsU.png","name":"BFI Network","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":12177,"logo_path":"/9P2VDiqTAr9qupVBbgCpf6FhLhn.png","name":"Ffilm Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":275370,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Wave Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Rick on the Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Canty","original_name":"Rick Canty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68d5518e3c49189c12a2bdf5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Atkin-Mayne","original_name":"Isaac Atkin-Mayne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d551a87e38cd1fd8882132","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35520283","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Folkestone Documentary Festival","release_date":"2025-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
