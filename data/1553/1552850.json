Drawing influence from the deep-mapping strategies of Michael Shanks and Clifford McLucas, this project combines new and archival footage with creative responses to produce a hybrid of documentary and experimental filmmaking. Several narratives of the site are coalesced, including the aircraft's former role as a photographic reconnaissance plane for nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll, the event of the crash and the artist's journey of discovery.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gHpoLwUua0Zp8P79M6PHTmiw6NB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A deep-mapping investigation into the B29 Superfortress 'Overexposed' wreckage through the eyes of visual artist Joab Harrison.","title":"Overexposed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5713616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joab Harrison","original_name":"Joab Harrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d711bb34d53513a138b200","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5713617,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Euan Morrison","original_name":"Euan Morrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d711d1fed97aaddb2ddc65","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j9OwlRDmqhCFgccYwblImGgTjzV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHpoLwUua0Zp8P79M6PHTmiw6NB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
