In the 18th and 19th centuries, optical views were shown in optical boxes with magnifying lenses. The showmen organised a real spectacle, with a barker, music and sound effects. The views played with light (transparencies, perforations). A series of engravings shows the public's enthusiasm for these shows. The second part of the film is a reconstruction of such a show. First, there are views of Paris, Venice, Constantinople and Versailles, followed by various disasters: plague, floods, fires and shipwrecks.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4eScTozC5irDRwYzHW2rN7oMMBw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84534,"logo_path":null,"name":"SODEP","origin_country":""},{"id":59943,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofidoc","origin_country":""},{"id":17184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seuil
