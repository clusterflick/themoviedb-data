Between playful humor and profound reflection, Fabrizio leads us through his world, where art is not decoration but revelation, not possession but pilgrimage. Shot within the timeless streets of Monti, this documentary captures the soul of a creator whose work reminds us that beauty is not bound by walls, but is a journey we all share.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/qeto793eVCBRVCmDgZTXSvWHH9E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Art is the spark of life.","title":"IL VIAGGIO","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrizio di Nardo","original_name":"Fabrizio di Nardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fabrizio di Nardo","credit_id":"68d67ef63f6413650e095d27","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Krastev","original_name":"Mario Krastev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3Fre8DQAscG1mqZ6x8UZLsuqOcB.jpg","credit_id":"68d67ea0c9f940a9f068b06a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712412,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nazmi Atan","original_name":"Nazmi Atan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67eb30437defbd8d3ced6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712483,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karl Owen","original_name":"Karl Owen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67ec4751f68bd8ac483d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mert Yağcı","original_name":"Mert Yağcı","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67ed3b801348272c4830b","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712410,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Ricci","original_name":"Anthony Ricci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67ee7d1be0547db6973be","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qeto793eVCBRVCmDgZTXSvWHH9E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197582,"name":"mysterious"},{"id":212737,"name":"philosophical"},{"id":325810,"name":"euphoric"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
