Under the care of Dr. Vasar, a disheveled yet dedicated psychiatrist, fragments of her harrowing past begin to emerge. Serafima’s father, Arhip, was a Russian Orthodox sect leader. The clash between her family’s adherence to these traditions and the encroaching influence of Soviet authority set the stage for Serafima’s ill-fated marriage to Raimond—once seen as an escape from her strict village but ultimately becoming a nightmare of suffering. As her memories resurface, Raimond's brutality comes to light, drawing Vasar further into Serafima’s fight. Torn between duty and morality, he risks his career to assist her.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17692,"logo_path":"/vdMBCn1foLJArmSaY094AQVrMyv.png","name":"Nafta","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":68045,"logo_path":"/nBxkA3fLDpLhngvt8l5lun7fJxk.png","name":"Studio Orka","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":138100,"logo_path":"/6cvw2OFBsqBPL1BAFek6eNuRqVQ.png","name":"Apollo Film Productions","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Serafima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3598774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vahur Afanasjev","original_name":"Vahur Afanasjev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cDpR3lGoTLgEVEoPxRDBed85nwz.jpg","credit_id":"68d53a440d7dc6231d13a56f","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veiko Õunpuu","original_name":"Veiko Õunpuu","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/igQRrttgSCXjQ6W8DBv0sH2xXqR.jpg","credit_id":"68d53afe28e21c7e9713a54b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veiko Õunpuu","original_name":"Veiko Õunpuu","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/igQRrttgSCXjQ6W8DBv0sH2xXqR.jpg","credit_id":"68d53b04950065ae8a19dc25","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403030,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Algus","original_name":"Martin Algus","popularity":1.1109,"profile_path":"/26RLtBVfRC0PuRLsntbPirJBM75.jpg","credit_id":"68d53b0b66f5e3477bf20ce0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137548,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mart Taniel","original_name":"Mart Taniel","popularity":0.6278,"profile_path":"/3pjNCuv5v0sl0pMDvoQdqgGIz74.jpg","credit_id":"68d53b1744f603bdeb59d503","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2776559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andreas Kask","original_name":"Andreas Kask","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d53b9c20520cef1b19dc11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esko Rips","original_name":"Esko Rips","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/i0SqMKbG82xPkXQETOwYoTA4NWn.jpg","credit_id":"68d53ba53d7be6582359d4c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715926,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alicja Gancarz","original_name":"Alicja Gancarz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d53bb8a9d080e8065b14c5","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976670,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gunda Bergmane","original_name":"Gunda Bergmane","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d53bc9d14da6f4bb88211a","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2730085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanel Tatter","original_name":"Tanel Tatter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d53bd20d7dc6231d13a596","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2730083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veiko Esken","original_name":"Veiko Esken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d53bdd7d69f19a1e8820ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
