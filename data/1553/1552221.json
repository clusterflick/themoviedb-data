But in Gaza, reporting is falling solely to a small number of Palestinian journalists, who are paying a terrible cost.  The BBC, in association with Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press, and Reuters, has launched a short film calling on the Israeli authorities to allow international journalists access to Gaza.  BBC News’ CEO Deborah Turness says “It is almost two years since October 7th when the world witnessed Hamas’ atrocities. Since then, a war has been raging in Gaza but international journalists are not allowed in. We must now be let into Gaza. To work alongside local journalists, so we can all bring the facts to the world.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The BBC Calls For Access To Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"International Media Must Be Allowed Into Gaza","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Dimbleby","original_name":"David Dimbleby","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/3IIBjSuJp5gIo12GWCcN1Ckkcda.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68d5754dacc83cbb71816cee","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
