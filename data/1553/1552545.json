Fictionalised documentary about Emile Reynau who invented the praxinoscope and its system of central mirrors. He then projects his paper strips into the projection praxinoscope before creating the Théâtre Optique, presented at the Musée Grévin. The perforated strips are fragile and often break. The show is cancelled. Reynaud tries to apply photography to his praxinoscope, but without success. Desperate and ruined, he throws his strips into the Seine. Only two survived.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7kEdLPFZJdrkyTTFCjF4iBqdkBD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84534,"logo_path":null,"name":"SODEP","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emile Reynaud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lonsdale","original_name":"Michael Lonsdale","popularity":0.4525,"profile_path":"/lQZktsBj1CFbIEIpXOZp55kCiB5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68d66960fb530ce1fb68ae35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marc Turine","original_name":"Jean-Marc Turine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Emile Reynaud","credit_id":"68d6698834938bdd49095df6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Erlish","original_name":"Benjamin Erlish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Piano player","credit_id":"68d669b71bfa38684ad3ce1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandro Lopez","original_name":"Alexandro Lopez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Baritone singer","credit_id":"68d66a01ad637009a9d3cf56","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Levie","original_name":"Pierre Levie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d668d6b92271a87cc83500","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683606,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raymond Fromont","original_name":"Raymond Fromont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d66a23cc6a608dba69c851","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4493543,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Désiré Berckmans","original_name":"Désiré Berckmans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d66a380a0c4d053f61125b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712276,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Michette Noterman","original_name":"Michette Noterman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d66a9d49d13b3cddd3ceb7","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosanne Van Haesebrouck","original_name":"Rosanne Van Haesebrouck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d66b87176e6c7f44697376","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7kEdLPFZJdrkyTTFCjF4iBqdkBD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":280918,"name":"praxinoscope"},{"id":320375,"name":"pre cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
