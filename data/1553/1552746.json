The clubhouse is run by CLEMENT, a \"star\" sponsor with a strong track record for keeping his sponsees sober. But Marty notices that, with disturbing regularity, the \"weakest links\" among Clement's sponsees keep flaming out spectacularly-- overdosing, committing suicide-- and Marty suspects that Clement is deliberately giving the most vulnerable a subtle kick and a shove over the edge. Clement is essentially a serial killer, but one that could never be arrested.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chip Person","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Monoson","original_name":"Lawrence Monoson","popularity":0.51,"profile_path":"/hli6dgeyskxXmfJwghyN1AtZCrn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"68d6c85d91f5c9115cc48538","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lippert","original_name":"Richard Lippert","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/usHQAnzP9NjFxoEYQD0ndX8wjEl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clement","credit_id":"68d6c86ece80f9318068b334","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean J.
