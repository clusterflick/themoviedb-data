While the first installment documented the Japanese advance through Malaya, Birth of Syonan-to portrays Singapore under occupation after its fall in February 1942. The film shows the renaming of the city to Shōnan-tō (“Light of the South”), Japanese victory celebrations, military parades, and efforts to depict the transformation of the colony under Japanese rule. Designed as a propaganda feature, it aimed to legitimize occupation and emphasize Japan’s leadership in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":157290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nihon Eigasha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1942-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malaya War Record: Birth of Syonan-to","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Marei Senki: Shōnan-tō Tanjō","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1942-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
