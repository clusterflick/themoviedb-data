A ‘panorama’ was a large painting on a cylindrical canvas. It provided a realistic and compelling view of a city, landscape or historical event, giving viewers the feeling that they were part of it. Viewers were positioned in the centre of a circular building or tent, with the canvas stretched around them. This provided a 360-degree view that gave a sense of depth and immersion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rVEy6n42EeWmfLEnrU1ei6fKjtk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84534,"logo_path":null,"name":"SODEP","origin_country":""},{"id":229132,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.M.P.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Odyssey of Panoramas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Levie","original_name":"Pierre Levie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d6788870fcb829a568aecd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Levie","original_name":"Pierre Levie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67891b14ddfc8d7d3ceb1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077566,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Rents","original_name":"François Rents","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d678f3edfdc1940a69723a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451445,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Etienne De Bruyne","original_name":"Etienne De Bruyne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67912775d308458611266","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3668684,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norman Roundell","original_name":"Norman Roundell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d6792690ffae701c6111a6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Létang","original_name":"Frédéric Létang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d67948e98dac151dc48382","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1314024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Françoise Levie","original_name":"Françoise Levie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d6795b3f6413650e095cd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712411,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aliette Cremer","original_name":"Aliette Cremer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d6797eb801348272c482d9","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134241,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alain Pierre","original_name":"Alain Pierre","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d679a1bea909ccdcc48485","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVEy6n42EeWmfLEnrU1ei6fKjtk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
