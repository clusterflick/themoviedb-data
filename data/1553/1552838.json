But when the interview veers into a surreal interrogation of her flaws, perceived and otherwise, the lines between reality and absurdity blur. April finds herself literally trapped in a cycle of coded critiques and thinly veiled microaggressions. Guided—or manipulated—by the enigmatic HR manager Marian, April is forced to confront the double standards, biases, and unrelenting expectations that have defined her professional life. As the lines blur between reality and a psychological purgatory, April must decide whether to stay silent or break free, once and for all.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wOr76sVG1QI02gXQ9QwXJf5iPTP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thank You for Your Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominica Ivey","original_name":"Dominica Ivey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68d708b0e4955079ab52fa4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5713584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erica Ja-Ki Truesdale","original_name":"Erica Ja-Ki Truesdale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68d708c2b7f786f4f0b408f9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5077617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricki Nelson","original_name":"Ricki Nelson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d708d2702ab47490c756b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35282117","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wOr76sVG1QI02gXQ9QwXJf5iPTP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":255763,"name":"last interview"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":349356,"name":"microaggressions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival International du Film black de Montréal","release_date":"2025-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
