'Where Time Stands Still' is a love letter to this magical place, told through the eyes of a pure-hearted woman who came for her honeymoon and never left. Under skies where the stars fall within reach, amidst mountains that cradle the Valley of the Thracian Kings, life unfolds at a rhythm lost to the modern city. Here, mornings begin with a chorus of birds and roosters, days stretch in harmony with neighbors, and faiths intertwine in shared celebrations. Children grow free beneath the Balkan peaks, learning life from nature rather than screens. A portrait of peace, belonging, and timeless beauty, this documentary captures a world where every moment feels eternal, and where love — for place, for people, for life itself — becomes a destiny.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8K7FxjoGa6uSTOVwtnRdXR3gPF4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Time Stands Still","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desislava Tsankova","original_name":"Desislava Tsankova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Desislava Tsankova","credit_id":"68d6814ff817a3dfaf90acda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Tsankov","original_name":"Ivan Tsankov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ivan Tsankov","credit_id":"68d681577295d9951e90ae50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaloyan Tsankov","original_name":"Kaloyan Tsankov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kaloyan Tsankov","credit_id":"68d68160f817a3dfaf90ace4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Tsankov","original_name":"Nikolay Tsankov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nikolay Tsankov","credit_id":"68d6817cad637009a9d3cfc2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5712532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keti Tsankova","original_name":"Keti Tsankova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Keti Tsankova","credit_id":"68d68188f817a3dfaf90acf0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Krastev","original_name":"Mario Krastev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3Fre8DQAscG1mqZ6x8UZLsuqOcB.jpg","credit_id":"68d6819962d27a2de790ad65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Krastev","original_name":"Mario Krastev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3Fre8DQAscG1mqZ6x8UZLsuqOcB.jpg","credit_id":"68d681a4de64903d1cd3cf50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Krastev","original_name":"Mario Krastev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3Fre8DQAscG1mqZ6x8UZLsuqOcB.jpg","credit_id":"68d681b409a6f47ec7095dd3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8K7FxjoGa6uSTOVwtnRdXR3gPF4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
