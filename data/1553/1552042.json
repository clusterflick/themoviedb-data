The show started off at the Battersea Arts Centre  in January of that year, before i took it to Australia for a bit (i got a special flight case made for the set of drawers, which was exciting, useful and then ultimately a nightmare to dispose of) and then came home and bobbed about the uk a bit. The show was last performed in New York at St Anns Warehouse in December of 2019.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniel Kitson - Keep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Kitson","original_name":"Daniel Kitson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/gjUl5d2o2oa6DxwecJBqV2rJQ2z.jpg","credit_id":"68d51b9aaa3484084059d433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
