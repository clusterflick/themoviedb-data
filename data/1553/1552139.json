The absence of sound has been filled in with intertitles that provide clues that help us recreate who might be filmed, where and when. These are images that in spite of their muted character reveal the extraordinary network that constituted the bulk of institutional psychotherapy in the French Postwar period, including figures like Frantz Fanon, George Daumézon and Jean Oury.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watching Tosquelles Films","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesc Tosquelles","original_name":"Francesc Tosquelles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d551d277f99f9e0719dc3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1501425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frantz Fanon","original_name":"Frantz Fanon","popularity":0.1461,"profile_path":"/sfbjgyLuYzr4Ae65eG94XxkqXMs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d551dcc98a16e9e75b1541","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Daumézon","original_name":"George Daumézon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d551fcca366752dba2bf94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Oury","original_name":"Jean Oury","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d5521b9617401123a2beb7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carles Guerra","original_name":"Carles Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d551b9d81f294efe5b158d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
