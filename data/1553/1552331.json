Kantor is to Polish art what Joseph Beuys was to German art, what Andy Warhol was to American art. He created a unique strain of theatre, was an active participant in the revolutions of the neo-avant-garde, a highly original theoretician, an innovator strongly grounded in tradition, an anti-painterly painter, a happener-heretic, and an ironic conceptualist. These are only a few of his many incarnations. Apart from that, Kantor was an untiring animator of artistic life in post-war Poland, one could even say, one of its chief motivating forces. His greatness derives not so much from his oeuvre, as from Kantor himself in his entirety, as a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk that consists of his art, his theory, and his life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kantor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4093378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Sapija","original_name":"Andrzej Sapija","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d5bbfae9171a933a6970a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1836016","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
