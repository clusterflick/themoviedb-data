The streets of Warsaw are walked by properly formed and organized masses of people, and from the grandstand they are greeted by successive leaders. There is an atmosphere of more or less artificially inspired enthusiasm. As time goes by, however, more and more images appear, contrasting with this idyllic vision of a constant holiday. Alongside images of official ceremonies, materials showing competitive, independent celebrations, organized by the illegal opposition, and pacified with the help of properly trained ZOMO troops, find their permanent place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where To","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Kędzierski","original_name":"Paweł Kędzierski","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/5qTzXi4yKgsveAGmaXLhG8ST4v6.jpg","credit_id":"68d5d0fb8a97804b45c48160","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
