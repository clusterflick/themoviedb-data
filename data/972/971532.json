The only hint of information we have to navigate through this complex and difficult film is at the head and tail of the film, in the rolling text \"credits\" introduced as positive at the head of the film and negative at the end. Technical information such as film stock, film speed, film length, camera lens, shutter, projector, and a host of other data appear on the screen like hieroglyphs of some secret language to be decoded.\" -Sandra Gibson and Luis Recoder","popularity":0.1006,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Internal Systems","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1734790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Coleen Fitzgibbon","original_name":"Coleen Fitzgibbon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6272b9e2a93d25006714b55a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
