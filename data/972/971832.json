On her deathbed, his mother entrusted him to his granduncle Zhao Tiantang. Zhao Da was romantically involved with Gou Dan, a poor girl from a neighboring village whose mother was gravely ill. Out of kindness, Zhao Da sold his sheep to help them. However, militia minister Mi Laichang intervened violently, capturing Gou Dan. Humiliated at a struggle session, Zhao Da defended her and was severely beaten. Gou Dan, in despair, drowned herself in the Yellow River. Following her death, Zhao Da's friend Shuangxi attempted to find him a wife but failed. Zhao Da, in a fit of anger, took down a \"ghost marriage\" notice to fulfill his mother's wish, which led to further conflict with Mi Laichang. He buried Gou Dan's remains in his family's ancestral tomb and left home in tears.","popularity":0.2377,"poster_path":"/xLFvn9LLj3DNy6PpkpkYeLncQl7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yellow River Made A Turn Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feng Enhe","original_name":"Feng Enhe","popularity":0.3027,"profile_path":"/38Rd1ACSLNsGDidAb9OLmcIe8y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zhao Da","credit_id":"668457adfb01a6d4fe17a198","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4806959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"王向荣","original_name":"王向荣","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"668457d54b4e17da8f3afe43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Yinglin","original_name":"Wang Yinglin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"668457e60b5ed62abd60a72f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2918551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bi Fusheng","original_name":"Bi Fusheng","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/i2gYeytw5sqe5moWzCu97BLyp0t.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Zhu San","credit_id":"66845804feec89abe3023e9c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4806960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"李良涛","original_name":"李良涛","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6684582954862f6923023eef","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2561960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jin Yin","original_name":"Jin Yin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66845743c1990be1c0034838","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4806955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"罗贤保","original_name":"罗贤保","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684578673ac03a094c67457","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531030,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xiaoqiang Xue","original_name":"Xiaoqiang Xue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66845883fa1bee375f60a761","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4806954,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"田东照","original_name":"田东照","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66845765ead3fb472b81659e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65285,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zhao Jiping","original_name":"Jiping Zhao","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/zt2Klnhx4T1u7cDoVvZXNMJpfVV.jpg","credit_id":"6684583c8098f8fa031b9957","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4806961,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Zhang Zhong’an","original_name":"Zhang Zhong’an","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684586b71ac33f2e517a5c8","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xLFvn9LLj3DNy6PpkpkYeLncQl7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
