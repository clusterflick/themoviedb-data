Inspired by jealousy, Scarpia orders his soldiers to torture Saranof for information leading to the location of a friend suspected of being an Austrian spy. Forced to listen to Saranof's cries of pain, Tosca relents and reveals the whereabouts of the friend. Spurned by Saranof for her weakness, she must then negotiate with Scarpia for his life and offers herself to the baron in exchange for a phony execution. While embracing, Tosca stabs and kills Scarpia, who supposedly has arranged for blank bullets to be put in the soldiers' guns. In spite of the baron's promise, Saranof is executed, and Tosca, destroyed, climbs the prison wall. Shot while climbing, she falls to her death.","popularity":0.1533,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of Hate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Nansen","original_name":"Betty Nansen","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/beE8zCyHfhl10U3ZqImASlAhgGG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Floria Tosca","credit_id":"6271b550245dbe337f4ec0f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Hoops","original_name":"Arthur Hoops","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/AfSySjPse2XC71HahkuQmaS1AAd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Baron Scarpia","credit_id":"6271b56529c6260051ab8753","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Bernard","original_name":"Dorothy Bernard","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/Aw51i2Azw2IICVyS8zpZE0VqFf6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6271b56a72d8551a4b2fbfc8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":992910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Whitney","original_name":"Claire Whitney","popularity":0.5842,"profile_path":"/sDSErFfsLHJtQXYIOv0Suz6zHrp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6271b5745800c4009cd8cbf1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rex Ingram","original_name":"Rex Ingram","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/xfFJVUEy2KZQxmN6icl3E0qx31n.jpg","credit_id":"6271b57fc74eba0f0e8efe7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
