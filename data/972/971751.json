The film and sound material was prepared in one simple action by bleaching away the side of a length of black leader, leaving a clear strip running along its length. The film has two sets of perforations and is twisted into a loop, known as a Mobius Loop. On projection, the strip of projected light switches from side to side, followed by a change in tone of the sprocket holes. Three 16mm projectors lie on their sides, and the loops are projected onto the screen as stacked blocks of light, gradually coloured by gels. The performance also makes use of the sound tone controls of the three projectors.  First performed at Star & Shadow Cinema, Newcastle 2007 with sound mix by Lynn Loo.
