He wife and children fled and the memory of his lynching faded from the local community. A sequence of events beginning with the publication of the Equal Justice Initiative's Lynching in America Report brought his, and many other, lynchings back into public view. The Oxford-Lafayette community, along with Higginbottom descendants, placed a memorial to Elwood. This film tells some of the impacts on the family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering Elwood Higginbottom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3536638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan P.
