They aimed to run 120 miles to the south coast, finishing in Dartmouth.  They stopped along the way in fields, farm yards, chapels, barns and orchards, to perform their show ‘These Hills Are Ours’.  The Wild Tour of Devon was a celebration of everything we’d all been unable to do over the past year: perform live, sing together, and run in places too wild to be accessible from our front doors. It’s a comeback tour with a difference.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/wGBjAfyN6N18E7eO5tL9SMPNl2A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174800,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARC, Stockton Arts Centre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3537354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Bye","original_name":"Daniel Bye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6273ade378570e00a049e509","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3537355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boff Whalley","original_name":"Boff Whalley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6273aded78570e00661fdd1a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bevis Bowden","original_name":"Bevis Bowden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273ad8fc0442918dff0a121","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bevis Bowden","original_name":"Bevis Bowden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273add3a93d251697ea1259","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bevis Bowden","original_name":"Bevis Bowden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273adc97cffda7316c6e4ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bevis Bowden","original_name":"Bevis Bowden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273adbea313b82f757ddfaf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wGBjAfyN6N18E7eO5tL9SMPNl2A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Premiere at Hinterlands International Rural Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube release","release_date":"2022-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Wild Tour trailer","key":"dLYcqCUIfzs","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-07T16:01:41.000Z","id":"6273ae5078570e005012a3c7"}]}}}
