The girl has given her heart to one of the classmates, unknown to the other.  The youth confesses his love, and is plunged into despair when told that her heart is another's. Coldly the classmates part, when the next day they start on their divergent paths of life. Years later, they meet again and while the trio enjoy a pleasant chat, a message calls the husband away, leaving his wife to entertain. The chum takes advantage of his absence to renew his protestations of love, which are spurned by the wife, who attempts to avoid him. He follows, whereupon the wife sends him reeling down the stairs, just as the husband reenters. The woman's denunciation of the friend brings about a terrific combat.","popularity":0.3514,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classmates","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dillon","original_name":"Edward Dillon","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/lRWa2M2guVQUo4GCMPComWsds79.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"A Classmate","credit_id":"593194ca925141705c00064f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Extra","credit_id":"593194d9c3a3682b010006d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
