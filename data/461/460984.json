The trustees send her to a finishing school, whose headmistress, Signorina Vitale, persuades Adele and her sweetheart, Tim Sullivan, that she should travel in Europe. Adele's new riches cause her to lose her sense of proportion, and she soon is involved with a fast set indulging in the jazz life. Even Tim cannot curb Adele's extravagance, and he returns to America while Adele marries Italian fortune-hunter Prince Arnolfo Da Pescia. When a will is discovered naming Tim as the rightful heir to Clark's Field, Adele and Arnolfo hurry to New York, and Arnolfo tries to steal the will, then dies in a hotel fire.","popularity":0.2802,"poster_path":"/wfGyO6gdraSwWZMfNdI1Xx21PKL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Money","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Adele Clark","credit_id":"5938fc6ec3a368784c00be68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Moore","original_name":"Tom Moore","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/kFvjLdK2Tcw7cUbWcLo5vQeS0Bd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tom Sullivan","credit_id":"61de21cc2811a1006971bed0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Powell","original_name":"William Powell","popularity":0.5224,"profile_path":"/8DTWs389THkVCTiDFu0x8ekNmUC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Prince Arnoldo da Pescia","credit_id":"5938fc81c3a368785a00c9fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Cassinelli","original_name":"Dolores Cassinelli","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/1rQYrsjzM4O8zKFGPFc7OUwJvHE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Signorina Vitale","credit_id":"5938fc8a925141088400ca89","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1079576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Foy","original_name":"Mary Foy","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/b8aWCouZvX0b9DXhHGMAtuKRBEf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"'Auntie' Clark","credit_id":"5938fc92c3a368781900cec6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lang","original_name":"Peter Lang","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/pWd2kgNuQ6cxWeRv514brKpzIqo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Judge Daniel Orcutt","credit_id":"5938fca0c3a368785a00ca10","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward O’Connor","original_name":"Edward O’Connor","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/qqe3cswsuupgC6LvKQoJBvBY2qb.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sheamus Sullivan","credit_id":"62558f1ec56d2d006719bf8d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Slattery","original_name":"Charles Slattery","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"O'Hara","credit_id":"62558f2daaec710e677d664a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Tuttle","original_name":"Frank Tuttle","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/nHq1loTuTtQs416Koylh91hspNk.jpg","credit_id":"5938fcb2925141088000ce63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1571612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julie Herne","original_name":"Julie Herne","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5938fcc1925141089900ca4a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Herrick","original_name":"Robert Herrick","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5938fcd3925141087c00c940","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Russell","original_name":"John Russell","popularity":0.6418,"profile_path":"/dtpDGQCHdouu55aoRrMniBBOFlY.jpg","credit_id":"5938fce1925141087c00c94e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0014825","wikidata_id":"Q16989085","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":782,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PRPfK5z3nKGElzdR14KXXARz1L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1389}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wfGyO6gdraSwWZMfNdI1Xx21PKL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
