He was involved in the German Revolution of 1918/1919 and had to leave the country as a result. Impoverished and lonely, he struggles on alone until the market saleswoman Hanne offers him shelter, although she does not have much money either. They fall in love and Martin even finds work on the construction site for the subway through Tempelhofer Feld. One day, however, he collapses there, whereupon the pregnant Hanne tries to nurse him back to health.","popularity":0.2313,"poster_path":"/minpkrbB8mqiLjq562XZeYvTDUV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carl Froelich-Film
