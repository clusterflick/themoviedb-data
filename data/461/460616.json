The ruler, Empress Nobu, the 8th generation of her family, wants to execute a bold plan to rescue a cyborg, Leah C6, trapped on the battle ravaged planet Endor. The Empress believes Leah C6 holds the secret to destroying the Alliance of Rebels before their insurgency can kill millions of citizens of the Empire. She recruits her heroic fleet commander, Lord General Luka Raan and asks him to gather a team from the Empire's elite soldiers, the Galactic Rangers. Raan assembles the team in the ruins of Endor which was attacked by depraved Rebels and outlaws led by, Kindo-Ker, a fanatical mystic in Dark Energy. The Galactic Rangers begin a desperate search to find and rescue Leah C6 before the Alliance Rebels can.","popularity":0.7551,"poster_path":"/1lDY7ZpEKOl3OaIQURjRbmFPfT8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curnan Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interstellar Civil War: Shadows of the Empire","video":false,"vote_average":4.75,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Thornton","original_name":"Brad Thornton","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Captain Starslayer Burk","credit_id":"5935ca0b92514104f3003002","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clare Hoak","original_name":"Clare Hoak","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/5d5V0Ve5NqELPGvfrCb9AZON1Zb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ren-Bergman","credit_id":"59f52bacc3a3682fd5002403","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie Carroll","original_name":"Jennie Carroll","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Abrami-Kenedi","credit_id":"5935ca4c92514104ea00304b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1153694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellie Church","original_name":"Ellie Church","popularity":0.2327,"profile_path":"/t7CH52rW7E8Cwy232uDapDp9BF4.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Empress No-Bu","credit_id":"5a1a8d4cc3a3680b8a0399ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1829154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gunn","original_name":"Paul Gunn","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sergeant Lobo Katz","credit_id":"5935ca8a9251410513002ce3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1430967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsey Carlisle","original_name":"Kelsey Carlisle","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/voy5n49Umhr4yssgVHBzZYmQZKp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lord General Oward Kazan","credit_id":"5935caaec3a3685bf90030db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1671664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Campbell","original_name":"Ashley Campbell","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/5TI4xgJtZ0EwA1NaH46ZBImRGDn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Corporal Jule Watts","credit_id":"5935cafac3a3685b8b002c44","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Ferrier","original_name":"Nathan Ferrier","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"McQuarrie","credit_id":"5935cb0dc3a3685bf900312e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat Cakmis","original_name":"Cat Cakmis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Leah C6","credit_id":"5935cb29c3a3685bf9003142","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Curnan","original_name":"Christopher Curnan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"I.
