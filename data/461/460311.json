Ever since his spectacular tomb was discovered, the boy king has been the most famous pharaoh of all ancient Egypt. But his mysterious death, at just 19 years old, has never been explained. In this BBC One special, presenter Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research and carries out unique experiments to get to the truth. For the first time, a virtual autopsy of Tut's mummified body reveals astonishing secrets about the pharaoh. Using CT scan data, the programme creates the first ever full size, scientifically accurate image of the real Tutankhamun. Brand new DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about Tut's family background, and the genetic trail of clues leads to a radical and revolutionary new theory to explain Tut's sudden and unexpected death. This is an epic detective story that uncovers the extraordinary truth of the boy behind the golden mask.","popularity":0.7845,"poster_path":"/aGhvvFkAT1nPhvzaLNsnOWaBKfH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75600,"logo_path":"/qvDku9orSiMgA1vIragz227hul8.png","name":"STV Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tutankhamun: The Truth Uncovered","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dallas Campbell","original_name":"Dallas Campbell","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/lBr4n544irZKPgm4Fg6x0Tg9kGB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"5932ec979251417dea00f1f2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Stubberfield","original_name":"Tom Stubberfield","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5932ecaa9251417dd400f5b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gary Scott","original_name":"Gary Scott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b56611511aa0039a11612","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Stubberfield","original_name":"Tom Stubberfield","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b5676d4cc8e0034eafa01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374673,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Laking","original_name":"Anne Laking","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b568abefd91003ad62450","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835906,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandra McLeod","original_name":"Alexandra McLeod","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b566bcb3084003685f789","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519875,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Latham","original_name":"Ryan Latham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b565929c626003a55821a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835907,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucy Mallatratt","original_name":"Lucy Mallatratt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b567f53866e0036e58048","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62657,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Harrison Karman","original_name":"Kate Harrison Karman","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/oQKNoQZ7bEq4ebC5jWxNXPA8mKS.jpg","credit_id":"5f9b569353866e0039e57fb3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5991596","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXqUr8fbb2iiztfxU2Goo9xzDAR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aGhvvFkAT1nPhvzaLNsnOWaBKfH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":157894,"name":"ancient egypt"},{"id":184134,"name":"archeology"},{"id":186939,"name":"pharaoh"},{"id":215218,"name":"king tut"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
