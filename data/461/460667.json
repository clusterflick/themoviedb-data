Her daughter, recently returned from an Eastern boarding school, could not assist her and, although the cowboys in her employ were faithful, the ranch needed an executive head. John Morgan, a neighboring ranchman, had long cast envious eyes upon the widow's increasing herd of cattle, and desired to marry the daughter in order to obtain possession of her ranch. He offers to manage her affairs for her, but the widow distrusts him and refuses his offer.","popularity":0.1562,"poster_path":"/pByJeIGYPuT7zSfhFgj6Tleb6Zr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poisoned Flume","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
