After a young woman is accosted by a dying warrior in the middle of the street, a bizarre incantation propels her into the realm of Darken - a violent prison-like world of labyrinthine rooms, interconnected with no apparent rhyme or reason and no way of escape. As she fights for survival within this brutal place, she finds allies who are rebelling against the rule of a self-appointed religious despot who demands allegiance to an all-powerful god called \"Mother Darken.\" Eve and her allies must fight with everything they have if they are to have any hope of surviving the horrors Darken has in store for them.","popularity":1.0353,"poster_path":"/cRI8vg9WfYguw6cI8urjCc6Myjk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6252,"logo_path":"/9b3MKk54TG6p059z0t9j4bqgnom.png","name":"Shaftesbury
