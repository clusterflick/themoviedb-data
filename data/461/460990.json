It broke 3 world records â€“ 1. Longest unsupported span of 3.024 kilometres, 2. Highest lift of its kind at 436 metres above the valley floor, and 3. Completes the longest continuous lift system on the globe. Discovery Channel spent two years documenting the massive construction project and has created a riveting story that details many of the challenges that are encountered when building this engineering masterpiece at 6,000 feet.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2k1dUWDVTG7VJgadDjEWczaTUxA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whistler's Twin Peaks","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Mathison","original_name":"Mark Mathison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59390878c3a36878ae00baaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2k1dUWDVTG7VJgadDjEWczaTUxA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
