This food movement can be traced back to one man: James Beard. His name graces the highest culinary honor in the American food world today—the James Beard Foundation Awards. And while chefs all around the country aspire to win a James Beard Award, often referred to as the “culinary Oscars,” many of those same chefs know very little about the man behind the medal. Respected restaurateur Drew Nieporent summed it up when he said, “Everybody knows the name James Beard. They may not know who he is, but they know the name.”","popularity":1.1795,"poster_path":"/6OIGGrJwiqzdaZccvJqkXCqXSmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the beginning there was Beard.","title":"James Beard: America's First Foodie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Beard","original_name":"James Beard","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"59375e24c3a3687344003a2c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Allen","original_name":"Ted Allen","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/mZ04c1SXP1DPlY4fF6waFzCDi4c.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59375ea4c3a3687344003ad5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Jones","original_name":"Judith Jones","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59375f00c3a3687317003729","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Higgins","original_name":"Greg Higgins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59375f2492514173320036ae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Wolf","original_name":"Clark Wolf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59375f5392514172f3003a2b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1255854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Pépin","original_name":"Jacques Pépin","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":"/ymheYhEzcAiuAq5iWNzg9Cpz5Dy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ea32d693faba00020452db3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Waters","original_name":"Alice Waters","popularity":0.1942,"profile_path":"/pgrIK3z0H3uHesMm5GflnwgCedg.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ea32d7e5a4690001d0fc377","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":195399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madhur Jaffrey","original_name":"Madhur Jaffrey","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/spOAkIujYaamd39H92amzj5OE8s.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ea32dbec6006d001dfdaf92","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beth Federici","original_name":"Beth Federici","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59375d8192514172e000378a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beth Federici","original_name":"Beth Federici","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59375d99c3a368736300374f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829694,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathleen Squires","original_name":"Kathleen Squires","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59375dacc3a368736e0031dd","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Snider","original_name":"Greg Snider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59375dcac3a36872cb003781","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6949222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bSt7KH2DIRYvOO9B3sPLENIHujX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6OIGGrJwiqzdaZccvJqkXCqXSmi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aAVMF3OgqU2ZfA0oMepClNDYCA1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10637,"name":"food"},{"id":15178,"name":"food industry"},{"id":18293,"name":"chef"},{"id":215720,"name":"gastronomy"},{"id":220064,"name":"culinary arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New York","release_date":"2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PBS American Masters","release_date":"2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
