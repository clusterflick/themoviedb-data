Pictures from the past pop up in her memory, and the viewer learns at what cost a single mother from the province managed to cherish Moscow's well-being. Lyudmila's story is typical, it reflects, like in a mirror, the pain points of modern life, forcing us to make our hourly choices. Is it worth a deal with the conscience of material comfort? Is it possible to achieve success in a megalopolis today and remain an honest person? Won't a \"bright future\" built on betrayal of one's own ideals lead to the decline of genuine human values?","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passenger Pictures
