Reverberating between multi-media versions of the same events, playing with disjunctions between figure and ground, HEAD is a 'trickfilm' meditation on portraiture; the animator, as actor, lives through his drawings, which in turn become actors who influence his own self-image. An insider's diary on the process of creation, HEAD is a brilliant encyclopedic exploration of the circular relationship between the animator and his creation, of the nature of animated illusion itself.\"  -Thelma Schenkel, Millimeter","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/i1GATrIDazCi02Jg7B7NzC920qH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Artists Public Service Program","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3508491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fred Israel","original_name":"Fred Israel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259f378dff66e0067375325","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Griffin","original_name":"George Griffin","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cbRYneA5oVlDqJkhsMmvbUPIuvM.jpg","credit_id":"5935b2cfc3a3685b650018ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3518706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i1GATrIDazCi02Jg7B7NzC920qH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":882,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cCjYSgzeiw9uvDOCNeKqM3xP0A7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":588},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2oIqWo9hYlsNljKuYfJpR85CQZz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
