His success is, in reality, a product of his marriage to his beautiful, socialite wife, Amanda, (Terri Polo) a wealthy timber heiress. Unlike most, who would remain content to enjoy a life of luxury and privilege, Brooks continues to risk everything by having extramarital affairs. Brooks' philandering, in addition to humiliating Amanda, has driven her to the point of a mental breakdown. Having been pushed over the edge, Amanda orchestrates a just and elaborate plan to bring her husband down. When Brooks leaves for a weekend romp with his latest squeeze, (Agnes Bruckner) his life quickly descends into a bizarre, nightmarish, downward spiral.","popularity":0.9211,"poster_path":"/AiIX3UTmBzSFQPvtNlMxfHNe1Zr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bit of Bad Luck","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cary Elwes","original_name":"Cary Elwes","popularity":1.5429,"profile_path":"/9UszBdQJ9PmyBydIeIBxlStozhW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Brooks","credit_id":"5320b3a9c3a3685754001a77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Bruckner","original_name":"Agnes Bruckner","popularity":0.4451,"profile_path":"/n9bglCZa1Qv9cYbP8f7hg32YciH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Heather","credit_id":"5320b3ccc3a368573c001ad8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teri Polo","original_name":"Teri Polo","popularity":1.2052,"profile_path":"/5xVk9bfMOeJxKmAGJddOhcNp2rX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amanda","credit_id":"5320b3d7c3a3685725001b85","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Bell","original_name":"Marshall Bell","popularity":0.7846,"profile_path":"/3AdZRUFlmV9KvArzqSVEVZVl0Sa.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mr. Creech","credit_id":"657d49c20816c7078b092010","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300524,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Fuhrman","original_name":"John Fuhrman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5320b3efc3a3685745001c6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300524,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Fuhrman","original_name":"John Fuhrman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536a1418c3a3681218007956","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225635,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Buckley","original_name":"David Buckley","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":"/q1yKKLlYetpFUhR9mrn8gw1SoxE.jpg","credit_id":"657d494d0816c707ab09186a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53811,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Stephen J.
