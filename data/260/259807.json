The people who planned the takedowns, or pulled the trigger, share their techniques and bring to light the many factors that had to be considered in each mission: terrain, wind speed, temperature, elevation changes... all are critical to taking out targets considered bulletproof. A sniper has one chance, one breath, to rise to the occasion and save the day... if they miss, there may never be another opportunity. As these never told before stories unfold, the viewer also learns about the high tech gear each sniper carries on their classified missions.","popularity":0.5348,"poster_path":"/3eezP2kx6LfYj3xh2voB6sgufE3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sniper - Bulletproof","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The History Channel - Sniper - Bulletproof","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Peyton","original_name":"James Peyton","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/8wn6QFSRyuvjwyIpOwIKo1t8tUj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Craig Harrison","credit_id":"60a27bbde18e3f002a43cdc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Ardisone","original_name":"Anthony Ardisone","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ron Szpond","credit_id":"60a27bcae18e3f002a43cdd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110109,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Damien Bray","original_name":"Damien Bray","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lead Humvee Driver","credit_id":"60a27bd8b0ba7e007941a1c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2016367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leni Ford","original_name":"Leni Ford","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/A1IcyB1yTESjucojcXPghptRJiU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Escaping Hostage","credit_id":"60a27be7b0ba7e00293f73f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1963146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Leary","original_name":"Joshua Leary","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/qIrrgX0k45p9czjM3pnzKhrMC2v.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Weilers shooter (sniper) (as Josh Winot)","credit_id":"60a27bf6da9ef2003f7218f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Lutz","original_name":"Mike Lutz","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/bgFYBFips9NX3gyZqAUksv3b4jM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jon Weiler","credit_id":"60a27c0262fcd3007846d591","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Pérez","original_name":"Mario Pérez","popularity":0.3197,"profile_path":"/wl2WqZ9uMHpHwhLP9nS0RmiiV3C.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robber","credit_id":"60a27c138072980029aa83ce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2409997,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kyle Shaw","original_name":"Kyle Shaw","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Spotter","credit_id":"60a27c23da9ef200291a8fa5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2201653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey R.
