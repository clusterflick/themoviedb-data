She plays the spoiled-brat daughter of a pudding manufacturer who has been entered into the town's mayoral race by some of the local businessmen. They have chosen him because they think he is easy to manipulate. As a sales gimmick, the pudding magnate advertises that his product contains the highly nutritious \"Vitamin Z.\" He suddenly begins selling pudding like crazy and soon his political campaign is well-funded. Unfortunately, there is no \"Vitamin Z\" and when this is discovered, the town fathers try to dump him and show that he is a fake.","popularity":1.1867,"poster_path":"/v7Tv0ZKhKGHVRnQ1OAqGjUzwW1H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"GYPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK!","title":"There's One Born Every Minute","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Herbert","original_name":"Hugh Herbert","popularity":0.3193,"profile_path":"/zEEjBlC4cPhn1xWN84eJ13dDJyR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lemuel P.
