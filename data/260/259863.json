The TauTona mine in South Africa, known as 'Western Deep' is the world's deepest gold mine. Employing more than 5,000 people, it operates twenty-four hours day. The film begins in complete darkness as the miners descend three-and-a-half kilometres underground. McQueen documents an intense work regime where the temperature can reach over ninety degrees celsius. Accompanied by jarring sounds created by the mechanical equipment, Western Deep is a hellish representation of labour that makes the silent resolve of the miners all the more powerful.","popularity":0.2471,"poster_path":"/rKyZ5pGeHKbCrwHHzSVB3aORQsC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Western Deep","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McQueen","original_name":"Steve McQueen","popularity":0.4663,"profile_path":"/if4tLIZJ0EJtyhlJaSzSwMQU5Yz.jpg","credit_id":"532930d9c3a3683d43000f19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54926,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sean Bobbitt","original_name":"Sean Bobbitt","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/fZh0FMaHlQCul9LozKJvI3QRJsg.jpg","credit_id":"5f42cfb541a5610034cd14f7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3323988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rKyZ5pGeHKbCrwHHzSVB3aORQsC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mcqueen-caribs-leap-western-deep-t12019","release_date":"2002-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
