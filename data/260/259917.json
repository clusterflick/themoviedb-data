His extraordinary portraits - of children, lovers, gangsters, supermodels, even the Queen of England - pushed the boundaries of art and broke world records at auction. They also enraged sitters and ended friendships. The royal photographer for The Times of London was so incensed by Freud's picture of the Queen that he said Freud should be thrown from the Tower of London. Freud, who died last summer, was notoriously elusive. Shortly before his death, however, he gave his full backing to this documentary. The film includes the only known footage of him painting on what turned out to be the last day he ever worked.","popularity":0.0667,"poster_path":"/9o09IYfQgSgMgPqVzveBKZGOnEq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freud's Naked Truths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucian Freud","original_name":"Lucian Freud","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"53805a76c3a368059e004c5c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall Wright","original_name":"Randall Wright","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53805a5ac3a368059b004c0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2212448","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9o09IYfQgSgMgPqVzveBKZGOnEq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Freud's Naked Truths - The Freudian Fascination with Animals","key":"jHUfW4yO77I","published_at":"2012-07-23T20:31:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec72ec3a368544800bfdd"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A New Kind of Nude","key":"i3hEZ-rJ6Jc","published_at":"2012-07-23T20:31:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec72ec3a368544800bfde"}]}}}
