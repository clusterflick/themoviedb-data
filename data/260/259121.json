Interweaving historical footage, interviews, and extensive conversations with Father Thomas, the film traces his spiritual journey from an affluent, well-connected New York City childhood, to an austere Trappist monastic life, to his rise through the Order, and his election as Abbot of St. Joseph’s Abby in 1961. In the early 1970’s Father Thomas introduced Eastern religious practices to the monks and became one of the originators of Centering Prayer. A renowned theologian and author of more than 30 books, Father Thomas Keating is widely recognized for his ecumenical approach to spirituality. For those who encounter him, his example is a moving modern journey of faith.","popularity":0.1628,"poster_path":"/oPuL9uRdn2vLOzthiaJs51DEBW8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If one completes the journey to one's own heart one will find oneself in the heart of everyone else.","title":"Thomas Keating: A Rising Tide of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Drew Martinez","original_name":"Drew Martinez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53227813c3a3685725004414","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300742,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter C.
