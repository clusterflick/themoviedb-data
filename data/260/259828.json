They have responded to an advert looking for people to take part in a 30-day medical trial. The company running the experiment, led by the co-ordinator, explains there will be no contact with the outside world. The group are free to leave at any time, but if they do, they will forfeit their fee: £20,000 per couple.  Mysterious, unexplained events occur around the castle and strange noises are heard in the middle of the night. At first the group are skeptical – they think the company is creating the illusion of a “haunting” to test their reactions, until it is revealed there is something more sinister involved.","popularity":0.0837,"poster_path":"/474HmunD3keIwtapMuRdTKB2pPF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloodless","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Vampires","type":"DVD Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1828840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jody Baldwin","original_name":"Jody Baldwin","popularity":0.2066,"profile_path":"/t7N13780xglhu1G65ggqIys2u3q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"64392aa2ab6849010336a2cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Hopkins","original_name":"Victoria Hopkins","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/vVEe18tm65xy1oWiQRh4NMOiUeH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tracy","credit_id":"643bc1798ec4ab04eeaed370","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1985975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Advani","original_name":"Melissa Advani","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Amanda","credit_id":"643bc1978ec4ab0470aed668","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":139952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Murrall","original_name":"Louis Murrall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"643bc1b7da10f01b8764acaf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Johnstone","original_name":"Richard Johnstone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5328d2769251413d83000531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1645184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/474HmunD3keIwtapMuRdTKB2pPF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
