The film is based on the true story of Sheriff's Deputy Kyle Dinkheller who - at the end of a shift - pulled over a speeding pickup truck driven by disturbed Vietnam veteran, Andrew Brannan. The results of this routine traffic stop were both tragic and deadly. Footage of the stop is now used in police training throughout the world.","popularity":0.2296,"poster_path":"/gKJv15APNdjfGGS7wowvAugxnT6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Random Stop","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Kennedy","original_name":"Geoffrey Kennedy","popularity":0.0994,"profile_path":"/qLjMd6PBGSXlkj2GYwUYgm8ImQJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kyle Dinkheller","credit_id":"536b2c09c3a3681238008e8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Krause","original_name":"Brian Krause","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/jW2vwTvcJAGxbiWMXD3p065Lhs1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Andrew Brannan","credit_id":"536b2c25c3a3681220009164","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Arfmann","original_name":"Benjamin Arfmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536b2bf2c3a368124a009270","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Arfmann","original_name":"Benjamin Arfmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536b2cf4c3a3683bf90006df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3226340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKJv15APNdjfGGS7wowvAugxnT6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Random Stop","key":"90068717","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-03-25T22:21:36.000Z","id":"5dcf1e35255dba000fd9bbac"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Random Stop - Teaser Trailer","key":"7DgX0WZthk4","published_at":"2014-02-28T20:00:04.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"id":"53dd0c3e0e0a26482b00279b"}]}}}
