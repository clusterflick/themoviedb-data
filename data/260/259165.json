Angel heads out to the streets of Berlin in his drag-racer to revitalize his flagging creativity. He is desperately trying for a new song that refuses to surface. He meets scrappy Johnny on the streets and saves him from everyone he tends to alienate: cops, motorcycle gangs, and passers-by. Johnny has his guitar with him and is the first to break Angel's deadlock. A tune he plucks out is just the beginning that Angel was looking for. The rest of the song lies out there somewhere and the two head into Berlin's night spots to find it.","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":"/oJXQNxpw9APXPlsOZlc9YjdDx1z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asphalt Night","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerd Udo Heinemann","original_name":"Gerd Udo Heinemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"5e4d60969a3c49001635574c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2543765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Davis","original_name":"Thomas Davis","popularity":0.2696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"5e4d60a69b8616001168df71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Rack","original_name":"Monika Rack","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"5e4d60b19b861600136891c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Helene Ruthmann","original_name":"Gabriele Helene Ruthmann","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nelly","credit_id":"5e4d60b935811d00194f1774","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Fratzscher","original_name":"Peter Fratzscher","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536f5f84c3a368122600deba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Fratzscher","original_name":"Peter Fratzscher","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536f5fa3c3a3683bf90056c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan van der Eerden","original_name":"Jan van der Eerden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658da9fba3361259e4593457","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66699,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Wiedemann","original_name":"Michael Wiedemann","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658daa0f84448e672fb52aef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160191,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Holger Scholz","original_name":"Holger Scholz","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658daa24f2cf2517754cbcad","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54538,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gunther Hahn","original_name":"Gunther Hahn","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658da9f455c1f4612139ef7f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":423441,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hartmut Eichgrün","original_name":"Hartmut Eichgrün","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658da9ed1b1f3c596dfce722","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32637,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernd Heinl","original_name":"Bernd Heinl","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658da9d420e6a566c78b4837","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534198,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sibylle Hubatschek-Rahn","original_name":"Sibylle Hubatschek-Rahn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658daa07c0442977e2846d57","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24159,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lothar Meid","original_name":"Lothar Meid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658daa18c044297815846156","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Fratzscher","original_name":"Peter Fratzscher","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4d60d1283ed900135c75b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0080387","wikidata_id":"Q96694075","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/oJXQNxpw9APXPlsOZlc9YjdDx1z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
