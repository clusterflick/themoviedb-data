Homage to post-war progress, this classic film celebrates the abundance of the Murray River Valley; from agriculture to timber, fishing to mining, fruit picking to shipbuilding. Proud and optimistic, it also celebrates the spirit of the people as they overcome problems of erosion, bushfire and drought and makes a plea for further development, arguing that at least another million people could find happy homes in this fertile territory.","popularity":0.1282,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Valley Is Ours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Lovell","original_name":"Nigel Lovell","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5327a5299251411a1b0014a8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Heyer","original_name":"John Heyer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5327a55b9251411a1e0013e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stanley Hawes","original_name":"Stanley Hawes","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/1Eo0X3Pp7szHewOPWgCUPAjdKjN.jpg","credit_id":"5327a5c69251411a110014bf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Heyer","original_name":"John Heyer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5327a5739251411a1700135c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301791,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reg Pearse","original_name":"Reg Pearse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537b3476c3a3685e1a0014d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301792,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edward Cranstone","original_name":"Edward Cranstone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537b346ac3a3685e39001578","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1813707","wikidata_id":"Q123289221","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
