This film analyses Aalto’s uniquely successful resolution of the demands and possibilities created by new technology and construction materials with the need to make his buildings sympathetic both to their users and to their natural surroundings. His inventive use of timber in particular represents both a reference to the forest landscape of Finland and a building material that is ‘warm’ and extremely adaptable. Filmed in Finland, Italy, Germany and the USA, this documentary shows how the Finnish natural environment and art traditions were essential elements in Aalto’s pioneering harmonization of technology and nature.","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":"/2qkhz8KTcITV2w0PmbGZ3ls5QGt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17494,"logo_path":"/cPpJx7pXATWwPYR4X8tBQ1zPZzg.png","name":"Finlands Svenska Television","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1987-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alvar Aalto: Technology and Nature","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvar Aalto","original_name":"Alvar Aalto","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lXBEMLrv65talku7SUVvyxntTkT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (Archive footage)","credit_id":"5e70c350357c000011464c26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2568965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maire Gullichsen","original_name":"Maire Gullichsen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/s1y1BOp58li8ZC4vTljvjgq6BNl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e70c36a4f9a990011531ffe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2568966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elissa Aalto","original_name":"Elissa Aalto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5fEClKyETknLGjX8ubebc9IMTog.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e70c3752f3b170014476f1a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ywe Jalander","original_name":"Ywe Jalander","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53273d229251411a1100019e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301691,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raimo Hartzell","original_name":"Raimo Hartzell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53273d679251411a050001b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2049387","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opsFECIrsP9T1Mz6A5dcdzfVYIJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2qkhz8KTcITV2w0PmbGZ3ls5QGt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
