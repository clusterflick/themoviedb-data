His figure is harshly lit by two tangles of light bulbs. He drops the brick, crushing one strand of lights. He again lifts the brick, allowing tension to accrue. The climax inevitableâ€”the brick falls and crushes the second set of lights. Here the film abruptly ends, all illumination extinguished.","popularity":0.424,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1971-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightfall","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Nightfall.","type":"On-screen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bas Jan Ader","original_name":"Bas Jan Ader","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/3q4rrelaequGRXUxfAwQXgO5mQm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"532749dcc3a368316a0005cf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bas Jan Ader","original_name":"Bas Jan Ader","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/3q4rrelaequGRXUxfAwQXgO5mQm.jpg","credit_id":"532749e6c3a36831520005bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8821698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2101,"name":"garage"},{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":164046,"name":"broken glass"},{"id":201171,"name":"lights"},{"id":207712,"name":"brick"},{"id":208015,"name":"conceptual art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
