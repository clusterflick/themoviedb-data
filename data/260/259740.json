(Jacques-Louis Mahé, a friend of Raymond Schwartz and under the pseudonym of 'Lorjak', had however already produced a silent Esperanto publicity film before World War II, titled Antaŭen! (Onwards!).  At the start of the 1960s Mahé, a professional photographic and cinematic expert, invested in the production of the first fictional film in Esperanto. Using a scenario by Mahé himself, the actors of the Internacia Arta Teatro (International Arts Theatre) presented a crime story, set in the Parisian periphery of petty thieves and cheats. Other notable people who played parts in the film included Schwartz (the commissioner), Gaston Waringhien (the voice-over) and many from the environs of the contemporary Paris, including a very young Michel Duc-Goninaz.","popularity":0.4885,"poster_path":"/oerqBH6m2RQGOPp49Xej1KH3SHl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Esperanto","iso_639_1":"eo","name":"Esperanto"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agonies","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Angoisses","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel
