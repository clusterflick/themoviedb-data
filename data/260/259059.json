He had a belief in self and sport that transcended all but the outer reaches of human speed and endurance. As a freshman, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which hailed him as \"America's Distance Prodigy\". By the time he died in a tragic auto accident at the age of 24, Pre held all 7 American records between 2,000 and 10,000 meters. Off the track, he fought relentlessly for the rights of amateur athletes to prosper for their sacrifices. Narrated by Ken Kesey, Fire On the Track is the story of this young lion's life, as told through rare footage and the memories of those who knew him best - his teammates, coaches, family and friends. Interviews include David Bedford, Frank Shorter, Ian Stewart, Bill Bowerman, Jeff Galloway, Dick Buerkle, Lasse Viren, Dana Carvey, Mac Wilkins, Kenny Moore, Dave Wottle, Alberto Salazar, and many more.","popularity":0.3336,"poster_path":"/rG6YpNecQejToOG4MbzzIDngXxt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire on the Track: The Steve Prefontaine Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2942472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Prefontaine","original_name":"Steve Prefontaine","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c6682841aac40fb3e5731a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3713059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Knight","original_name":"Phil Knight","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c66833eec5b500ff523d64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Carvey","original_name":"Dana Carvey","popularity":0.871,"profile_path":"/qlb0apjFhoQ9UwCcvzrLm1mTIx0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c6683c63e6fb00e12b2f0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Kesey","original_name":"Ken Kesey","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/lZztcmjfhJvS01mkbsmegel82hj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64c6684e95ce2400af1bb9ef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Moore","original_name":"Kenny Moore","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e4df7044a424018610eb55","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Lyttle","original_name":"Erich Lyttle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"536b24b6c3a3681238008dcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Kesey","original_name":"Ken Kesey","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/lZztcmjfhJvS01mkbsmegel82hj.jpg","credit_id":"64c667a995ce24011e5960b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1260355","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rG6YpNecQejToOG4MbzzIDngXxt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":606}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
