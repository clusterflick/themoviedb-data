Music by Big Brother and the Holding Company, and the Charlatans is also featured. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls and plenty of illegal drugs. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, and even a performance of some of the musicians who appeared there.","popularity":0.8761,"poster_path":"/pBQolWpPYBwPOtwnTZbHCbtlYra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monterey Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rockin' at the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Life and Times of the Red Dog Saloon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Hesseman","original_name":"Howard Hesseman","popularity":0.894,"profile_path":"/rChr7Bl55WwDd7iuviqgWVDC6LJ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"532876b09251413d8000008b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1048621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Fosselius","original_name":"Ernie Fosselius","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/lL4S5A6r6pZ8mqKQKYIe6SJfFA4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"532876ee9251413d7000008b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19747,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Nutt","original_name":"John Nutt","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"532877049251413d79000097","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":993165,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mary Works","original_name":"Mary Works","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"532876ca9251413d76000090","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1098215","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1654,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pBQolWpPYBwPOtwnTZbHCbtlYra.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1108}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10572,"name":"music business"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rockin' at the Red Dog - Take 1","key":"p_zqBXlW7H8","published_at":"2011-08-07T19:09:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec72ec3a368544800bfc6"}]}}}
