Those who have worked with her claim that “Merkiavelli” exercises power without moral barriers, just as Machiavelli taught. A journalist, who knows her well, claims that she uses the methods of a Mafia godmother. In 2008, the German Chancellor was asked to handle the international financial crisis. The countries of the South were placed in the test tube. “If I had to write a book on the Shock Doctrine at this moment,” says Naomi Klein, “it would be on Greece.” How did Merkel manage to impose German hegemony in Europe?","popularity":0.155,"poster_path":"/9oUHhJ9s98cLYkkYaUlYMJR2HoN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2014-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Godmother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"I nona","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Beck","original_name":"Ulrich Beck","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/vCj9DUHGTw2hcnrWPolUqpmQINz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6201b82a4df291008efc5b1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beppe Grillo","original_name":"Beppe Grillo","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/Aje4Yuf00ccLm7wzt4pwo0gNHSM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6201b8392f3b1700cc761851","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3417434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud Höhler","original_name":"Gertrud Höhler","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6201b8605c5cc80043b451cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Klein","original_name":"Naomi Klein","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6201b86e2f1be00110646b35","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reiner Kröhnert","original_name":"Reiner Kröhnert","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6201b8a064f716006cf91d79","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Merkel","original_name":"Angela Merkel","popularity":0.2936,"profile_path":"/fjlqfSwhiRpwgsEtzJ8X004NpBw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6201b8abd7dcd20043c29d7b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1981890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harald Schumann","original_name":"Harald Schumann","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6201b8ccbcf8c9004278473c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stelios Kouloglou","original_name":"Στέλιος Κούλογλου","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/jFUTmKKzUVAgQlKjo0chhQ9Yb0z.jpg","credit_id":"5328b624c3a3683d53000481","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stelios Kouloglou","original_name":"Στέλιος Κούλογλου","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/jFUTmKKzUVAgQlKjo0chhQ9Yb0z.jpg","credit_id":"6201b936e24e3a00204107ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3654260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1993,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGarPMacA3RXa1IY4PFzmuZFfMw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3543}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9oUHhJ9s98cLYkkYaUlYMJR2HoN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1234,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/ovxmfTRtq3p70CyNQWjKbZyi3EC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":823}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2014-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
