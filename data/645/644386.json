There is no turning back. What would I have done or not done, if I could turn back time? Which of my actions or oversights have I regretted? I wonder, did I live well or did I waste the amount of time given to me? Important people, sculpted over time and standing at the threshold of life, talk, freely at last, about the journey of their life and bestow, as a gift, the precious essence of their life. The almost distilled opinions of these people are dramaturgically included in the fictional part of the documentary. Where the journey of life on Earth unfolds through the narrator's voice, while we follow the course of a child alongside a small wooden boat: from the springs of a river to the mouth of the sea, corresponding to Man's voyage from birth to death.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/cSiOU5hTifTmY1cLtjcGvWl1SYN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kakavias Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giannis Fertis","original_name":"Γιάννης Φέρτης","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":"/mU9O5ktZU9DczGTNAcF3rSJbxpj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbc98d6d388ae0012d85cbf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dinos Giotis","original_name":"Dinos Giotis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4a7ea37e0002ad04e04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dinos Giotis","original_name":"Dinos Giotis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4b96cf3d5002bcca8b3","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panagiotis Kakavias","original_name":"Panagiotis Kakavias","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4c3c8a5ac00304d2aca","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harry Huta","original_name":"Harry Huta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4d315c636004623fd1c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004424,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kostas Drimtzias","original_name":"Kostas Drimtzias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4e25f622b0059891969","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647382,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dimitris Kordelas","original_name":"Δημήτρης Κορδέλας","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4ecea37e00045408666","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2903056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Giotis","original_name":"Δημήτρης Γιώτης","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f4f554508d0043970fed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723321,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Costas Chrysogelos","original_name":"Costas Chrysogelos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f502c4ad590058fd2fa9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2903056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitris Giotis","original_name":"Δημήτρης Γιώτης","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f50dd8e225006f3bd2c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harry Huta","original_name":"Harry Huta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f52a4284ea005ae2b96b","department":"Sound","job":"Supervising Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1620684,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yiannis Skandamis","original_name":"Γιάννης Σκανδάμης","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f539ea37e0002ad04ecf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004426,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedram Vossoughi","original_name":"Pedram Vossoughi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047f54415c6360070ff6f23","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dinos Giotis","original_name":"Dinos Giotis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbc98b6d2c0c10016204499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9804080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1737,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/cSiOU5hTifTmY1cLtjcGvWl1SYN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1233}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
