The film is also the director's bow to the victims of the darkest chapter of Austria's recent history. A chapter that seems to have been extended to a certain extent when it comes to restitution of looted property to the descendants of Holocaust victims.","popularity":0.3134,"poster_path":"/m7prlt9ULagUZe544HY8o3yMxMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burgl Czeitschner Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Keep It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz von Friedl","original_name":"Fritz von Friedl","popularity":0.2434,"profile_path":"/4Znplm3Dadz0vOBRd9J8J8GzQ59.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sprecher","credit_id":"5dbac64ad2c0c100161d1334","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burgl Czeitschner","original_name":"Burgl Czeitschner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbac5ac12970c0018386813","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burgl Czeitschner","original_name":"Burgl Czeitschner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbabc6f0792e1001549a649","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Andel","original_name":"Jonathan Andel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbac53edbf144001651be6d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8896972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAbyFv0m7LjUkSK3DEzkAYvd9RX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pGkcPyZgZmjmSiygL9JNBdWzzOq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kiaTHXopM7sbnJkFWNriobAZNNh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":807,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7prlt9ULagUZe544HY8o3yMxMw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":258874,"name":"restitution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
