With great energy, sometimes funny slips, too, but mostly with the appropriate royalist seriousness, Princess Margareta of Romania plays her role as the subject and object of her own campaign. The performance is of the tale of new wine in old wineskins. Surrounded by her courtly entourage, Margareta travels through “her” country in the same old royal train, on the same royal route, in which her father, King Michael the First already sought contact with his subjects. It goes without saying that the red carpet as the most obvious symbol of monarchist grandeur must be immaculate even at the tiniest stop – though this isn’t always achieved perfectly.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/r0NTFXjWO0yZvMHOjaIC5i2rW0Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2019-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Train","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Holzhausen","original_name":"Johannes Holzhausen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea5cf0b7304b5001e65207a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/315oCGJqQhTdJomJ1FgKLNqQuUE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nrhs2wTvFXbdRHspmVvWQjnurIm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1813},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pqI6GoGeDXhjJFjAL11ZGt1pQPd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1007,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1TREMFoq8pKNA34yACLZqe1FCtA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1790},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1041,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwg6cQIE4fWC5vJq6QvvNrdTRvV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1851},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qeOx2r9FnLfW29nXxtVSjGXoZgz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1799},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2028,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oF8loIlRDqv1dXxB9p9VFmwM0qj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3605}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r0NTFXjWO0yZvMHOjaIC5i2rW0Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (DOK Leipzig)","release_date":"2019-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
