Playwright José Zorrilla's work, was first written and published in 1844, and it soon became one of the most popular plays of the 19th Century. Spanish Director Alejando Perla's own 1952 cinematic version is probably the best-known of several films made concerning Zorrilla's take on the exploits of the immortal Don Juan-in just a 15 year period, (starting in 1936). His version stands out because it focuses on why Don Juan Tenorio should repent, after reflecting on a hedonistic life of drinking, followed by his enchantment, seduction and ultimate corruption of the innocent and married women he seduced then callously abandoned all throughout Seville.","popularity":0.2254,"poster_path":"/4eD6AvZSdoEwSS3haRjqrx9xlQ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Juan Tenorio","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrique Diosdado","original_name":"Enrique Diosdado","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/e8ZNiGATAXOA8m88POLOQU3hf79.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Don Juan","credit_id":"5dc8b8157d2bc1001347bb9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4985956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Carmen Díaz de Mendoza","original_name":"María Carmen Díaz de Mendoza","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Doña Inés de Ulloa","credit_id":"6703e7957cfea6f20273f0e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José María Rodero","original_name":"José María Rodero","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/u7b5ys1J7UWRIOCsRErNhOpXYau.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Don Luis Mejía","credit_id":"6703e7cd4cf47c730f73f3e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2901958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Seco","original_name":"Carmen Seco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Brígida","credit_id":"6703e8047cfea6f20273f0f2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaspar Campos","original_name":"Gaspar Campos","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Don Diego Tenorio","credit_id":"6703e8203d7b3c6c077961d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":580219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Álvarez Rubio","original_name":"Pablo Álvarez Rubio","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":"/ld0mAmcIB4C0lYmbceNxXS3aRYt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Don Gonzalo de Ulloa","credit_id":"6703e8587cfea6f20273f144","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Marsillach","original_name":"Adolfo Marsillach","popularity":0.3439,"profile_path":"/na24PgI07dlXh86yY6xehmC1MnF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Capitán Centellas","credit_id":"5dc8b82299259c665e7a91af","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pepita C.
