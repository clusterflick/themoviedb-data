Gould's clear, analytical manner of speech delivers a stream of pointed observations, dry jokes, and childhood memories, revealing his nuanced lifelong relationship with the city: not the simple one of a booster, nor the even simpler one of a detractor. But then, Gould never had anything simple about him â€” nor, as I've come to find out this past week, does Toronto.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9Qu5hs8cvXkFkIi3bTO4Tcou3Wn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glenn Gould's Toronto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Gould","original_name":"Glenn Gould","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/6cHQYRTbAzPJJnZQhCMapHGFyNe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dbc7f3ad388ae0010d8409e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Gould","original_name":"Glenn Gould","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/6cHQYRTbAzPJJnZQhCMapHGFyNe.jpg","credit_id":"5dbc7ef10792e100134d508c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John McGreevy","original_name":"John McGreevy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbc7f18d2c0c1001b1f8af2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Qu5hs8cvXkFkIi3bTO4Tcou3Wn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tUg3Q3dT5EkhovJ6O9T8lbTvbtI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
