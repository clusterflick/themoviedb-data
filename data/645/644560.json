From the dancer under the spotlight to her reality behind the scenes, the documentary approaches Sol Pico’s daily life at a crucial moment in her career after winning the National Dance Award. Also  it goes across Sol Picó’s artistic career, from the beginning of her performance, to the street theatre and, finally, her artistic consolidation and the creation of her own company. Her work is characterized by showing a strong and brave woman but who is not afraid of showing her weaknesses without taboos. The project also brings the artist’s more personal side closer: the difficulties of growing up as a dancer, the difficulties of creation and how to face her career after turning 50.","popularity":0.1623,"poster_path":"/d3CKH5ULQHuPTPYDIrLF2HPbSID.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From knee to heart","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sol Picó","original_name":"Sol Picó","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself / Ella misma","credit_id":"5dbd80b57d2bc10013341257","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1369119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanna Barranco","original_name":"Susanna Barranco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbd80a2c8a2d40018a276a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9408994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/d3CKH5ULQHuPTPYDIrLF2HPbSID.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":733,"name":"dancer"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Choreoscope Festival","release_date":"2019-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
