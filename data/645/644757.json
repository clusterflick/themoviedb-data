The photographs are animated through a re-filming process to create a flow of moving images that are intercut with passages from the movie. Iconic actress Jeanne Moreau, using a text by American poet Kimiko Hahn, narrates the diary-like fragments of memories and recollections in the first person. The haunting music by Lois V Vierk accentuates the fleeting quality of these fragments of dreams and memories.” — Jon Gartenberg","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vX8LxJ4NgIMPCFZBYtgC6MDBlnn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everywhere at Once","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1135813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Holly Fisher","original_name":"Holly Fisher","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/AjmBUj9GQm8qUW3NVw1ccmQe6Ir.jpg","credit_id":"5dbe45f29638640012e2ee82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lois V Vierk","original_name":"Lois V Vierk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbe46249638640012e2eec4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vX8LxJ4NgIMPCFZBYtgC6MDBlnn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
