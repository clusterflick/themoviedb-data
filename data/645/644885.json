Itâ€™s a time not far from the dawn of the moving image, the obsessed and wealthy Dr. Epstein engineers a number of scientific experiments. He subjects his adopted children, Pete and Re-Pete, along with his darling flapper, Baby Dee, to his various scientific tasks. Things take a decidedly strange turn when Epstein makes a deal with some shifty-looking vagabonds. On doing so he opens a door to the unknown, ruptures the fabric of time and unleashes a shadow-like character bent on reducing all those he encounters to dust.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/3JDmZDJrJuTU99MKV8vWH9752JI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Film Society","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumnal Sleeps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Everitt","original_name":"Natasha Everitt","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc082307d2bc1001738df94","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Servant","original_name":"Alain Servant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc08238f1b5710013e958b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ambra Gatto Bergamasco","original_name":"Ambra Gatto Bergamasco","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc0824b9d893900183105ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik Gard","original_name":"Henrik Gard","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc082537d2bc1001338de9a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbedc439d893900132e2efb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc08102470ead00138923ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc08111f1b5710013e95770","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc080aaef4889001116d235","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc080ed7d2bc1001338dd05","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449112,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Higgins","original_name":"Michael Higgins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc080bcf1b5710015e96223","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11788294","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8wWNXT033kai9u7m3BGGzirteCs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3JDmZDJrJuTU99MKV8vWH9752JI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/udOSpBq5YNivV9DbU5SynyI7bwE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qoJUN8IMnGkDoNamkhE124B4xpP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Luminous Void Experimental Film Festival (LVEFF)","release_date":"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Autumnal Sleeps (2019) - TRAILER","key":"368852460","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-25T17:54:34.000Z","id":"5dc0812495c0af00186e9f77"}]}}}
