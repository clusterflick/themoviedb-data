To steady his nerves, he attends a party that evening, and here he meets Leonid Ivanoff, a tormented Russian artist who tells him about a demonic woman who haunts and hypnotises him. Before leaving the party, Ivanoff gives his keys to Berg, fearing he might ‘strike her down’ if he returns home and finds her there. Later that night, Berg ends up in Ivanoff’s small attic studio and indeed finds the eerily staring woman there. Wrapped up in a haze of alcohol and fear, Berg loses control and hurls an axe at her face.
