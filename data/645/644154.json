Its doctrinal influence and its enormous capacity for enthusiasm would mark in the early sixties Évora's group of painters (Lapa, Palolo) and, in the 80's, artists such as Xana and Cabrita Reis. At his death, a moving tribute was paid to him by a huge and varied group of artists ranging from João Vieira to Miranda Justo. His work is scattered in a large number of private and institutional collections.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/29U2Eq04D5MhSvrbqLNlPKDZhGt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artistas Unidos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joaquim Bravo, Évora 1935, Etc.
