The flight took less than two minutes, but it left spectators awestruck. While the combined talents of Wilbur and Orville Wright had produced the first plane capable of controlled flight , their distrust of others had almost cost them the credit for their invention. Now, having proved to the public that they had mastered the sky, the reserved brothers from the small town of Dayton, Ohio, became world celebrities.","popularity":0.7879,"poster_path":"/ygXMafqFhsvLXFHVgIvu0GuQXIO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wright Stuff","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David McCullough","original_name":"David McCullough","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/wgWz9xD6ZXl547LR4VrSQifsKUr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"5dbcd3410792e100184be765","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garrison Keillor","original_name":"Garrison Keillor","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/3Uif4EDVdfewXNREn5vT1OGITgX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5dbcd35e97a4e600157c91f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355924,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Hudec","original_name":"Kate Hudec","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd2db54f6eb00154fdb75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melanie Perkins-McLaughlin","original_name":"Melanie Perkins-McLaughlin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd30fa5890200196b1c85","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nancy Porter","original_name":"Nancy Porter","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd27e97a4e600157c90c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":941424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne Jordan","original_name":"Jeanne Jordan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd2eda5890200196b1c07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116085,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Bacon","original_name":"Michael Bacon","popularity":0.1711,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd2fea5890200196b1c48","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319524,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Hoving","original_name":"Peter Hoving","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd320a5890200196b1cde","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nancy Porter","original_name":"Nancy Porter","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd2940792e100134dc7c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judy Crichton","original_name":"Judy Crichton","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd2ab54f6eb00134f8e2e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nancy Porter","original_name":"Nancy Porter","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbcd28ad2c0c100181e9576","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0394114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/miRr30hq9Omx9xYygUEDgCfilwn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ygXMafqFhsvLXFHVgIvu0GuQXIO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8044,"name":"flight"},{"id":208367,"name":"wright brothers"},{"id":225223,"name":"american experience"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
