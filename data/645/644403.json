Traveling between contemporary Tunisia (shot in exquisite 16mm black-and-white) and 100 years prior to independence (narrated with ink-etched cutouts), Mohammadia re-envisages official colonial history. The film recounts, in the style of a folk tale, how Bey Ahmed I became smitten with Versailles after a trip to Paris and decided to build an equally sumptuous palace for himself in Tunis, driving his country to ruin in the bargain.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mohammadia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721121,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ahmed Bennys","original_name":"Ahmed Bennys","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbc9f00d2c0c1001b1fb8f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
