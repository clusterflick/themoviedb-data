The opera is set in a rural environment and the action takes place in a country farm. It is a brilliant comedy with many points of contact with semi-serious operas. The choice of this subject must have been strongly influenced by the successes of Vincenzo Bellini's La Sonnambula.  The music is folksy and the melodic writing frank and straightforward with a broad variety of passages of high technical content and more elegiac in character; such is the case of the most famous piece in the whole opera, the aria \"Una furtiva lagrima\", which is also the leitmotiv of the soundtrack of the 2005 film Match Point, directed by Woody Allen.","popularity":0.0684,"poster_path":"/vIHlkYAYsbfjqTQSbKFlt35BX0m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dynamic Srl","origin_country":""},{"id":124757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bergamo Musica Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2007-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Melodramma giocoso in two acts.","title":"L'elisir d'amore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Dalla Benetta","original_name":"Silvia Dalla Benetta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Adina","credit_id":"5dbc52c60f2fbd001479f9a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Hernández","original_name":"Raúl Hernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nemorino","credit_id":"5dbc53000f2fbd001479fa3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damiano Salerno","original_name":"Damiano Salerno","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Belcore","credit_id":"5dbc5319d388ae0016d7e51d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Esposito","original_name":"Alex Esposito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AbAWMb7rgmwwfaBSpztz5tNYsu4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dottor Dulcamara","credit_id":"5dbc53450792e100154c3c7e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Borin","original_name":"Elena Borin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Giannetta","credit_id":"5dbc5357d388ae0016d7e5b8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5dbc56e1d388ae0016d7ecbb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessio Pizzech","original_name":"Alessio Pizzech","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbc53c10792e100154c3e06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro De Marchi","original_name":"Alessandro De Marchi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbc53ae0792e100154c3dce","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Romani","original_name":"Felice Romani","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/3ADAhIAv7prrxVPzVhPjZdiR65B.jpg","credit_id":"5dbc571e54f6eb00134ec94a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4isKTHeetCIN6AIfiSyIaIa6HR8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1384,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/upSmdTs1waPC1XHBaRc9SEcma7Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1038},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vIHlkYAYsbfjqTQSbKFlt35BX0m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1013}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
