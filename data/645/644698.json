The audio of this performance was recorded on CD with music by David J and Tim Perkins.  In 1993, a graphic novel adaptation of \"The Birth Caul\" was published.  This video combines the audio and visuals of \"The Birth Caul\" to create a unique metaphysical experience.  Hopefully this captures the spirit and the magick of this performance in a manner evoked by Alan Moore on that night.  Please experience this video as a tribute to the creators of this art.","popularity":0.089,"poster_path":"/5vdAiafMxFyLIpZ9LrJ4U0nASfX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birth Caul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487205,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eddie Campbell","original_name":"Eddie Campbell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/auQu4wLntQSgZkxBBT4pH7cGiv7.jpg","credit_id":"624578706dc50700931c7dd3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487205,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eddie Campbell","original_name":"Eddie Campbell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/auQu4wLntQSgZkxBBT4pH7cGiv7.jpg","credit_id":"624578adc740d90047b40d9c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487205,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eddie Campbell","original_name":"Eddie Campbell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/auQu4wLntQSgZkxBBT4pH7cGiv7.jpg","credit_id":"624578919451e700498e055d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Perkins","original_name":"Tim Perkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbe2cb89d893900182d1097","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David J","original_name":"David J","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbe2b577d2bc10013353fb8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Moore","original_name":"Alan Moore","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/dS0Vlap8GBkwTvDU4BRm1Qu50YV.jpg","credit_id":"5dbe2a32efe37c0018822fd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Moore","original_name":"Alan Moore","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/dS0Vlap8GBkwTvDU4BRm1Qu50YV.jpg","credit_id":"5dbe2a3e9638640016e2c9ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5vdAiafMxFyLIpZ9LrJ4U0nASfX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
