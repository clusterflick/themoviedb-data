But when one of his conquests ends in murder, he finds himself on the run, pursued by disgruntled ex-lovers, fiancées and a force from beyond the grave.  Following his recent spectacular production of Paria, the renowned British director Graham Vick makes a welcome return to OperaVision with this new Don Giovanni from Rome. Italian baritone Alessio Arduini plays the dishonourable Don alongside Georgian soprano and Moniuszko International Vocal Competition winner Salome Jicia as Donna Elvira. This performance is part of OperaVision’s events celebrating the inaugural World Opera Day on 25 October 2019.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/rUYDQSUg9Kp6RkpJyfchADDngUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni - Opera di Roma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessio Arduini","original_name":"Alessio Arduini","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac5130792e100134a7e56","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vito Priante","original_name":"Vito Priante","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/4DdT3wlpfKUYuThNskywp41AjhZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac5180792e1001848f4b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuele Cordaro","original_name":"Emanuele Cordaro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac51e0f2fbd001477abec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Di Matteo","original_name":"Antonio Di Matteo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac524dbf144001351d9e8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Francisco Gatell","original_name":"Juan Francisco Gatell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5LupvP3TSaYzXKL4ybpKKu2Kzrh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac52b0f2fbd001477abf4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1520275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grazia Schiavo","original_name":"Grazia Schiavo","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/tEkBM1ZyPzZfImo3ArDteSjqh7o.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"620133b410923000660eaa09","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salome Jicia","original_name":"Salome Jicia","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac5390f2fbd001778a18c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Croux","original_name":"Marianne Croux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbac54054f6eb00184c5a35","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"61cf0bedd75bd655ae9b60dd","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Vick","original_name":"Graham Vick","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbac5570f2fbd001477ac3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérémie Rhorer","original_name":"Jérémie Rhorer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bEhCGtV1VNSli5X8ivQATxhszht.jpg","credit_id":"5dbac54cd2c0c1001b1cafec","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUYDQSUg9Kp6RkpJyfchADDngUI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
