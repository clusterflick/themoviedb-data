Especially in the opening theater sequence, and in the climactic “transformation” sequence, several different shots are edited together to create a fluid, dynamic scene. Cinematography shows the first spark of flexibility with a couple of tilting movements. There is a new energy in direction with strong fore-to-back staging. There are also some insert close-ups and some relatively unusual medium close-ups of action.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Great Uncle's Spirit","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ober","original_name":"George Ober","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Miser","credit_id":"59d9c14d92514124eb038106","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0339154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
