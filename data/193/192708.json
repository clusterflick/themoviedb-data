Since the 1960s the world population has nearly doubled, adding more than 3 billion people. At the same time, talking about population has become politically incorrect because of the sensitivity of the issues surrounding the topic- religion, economics, family planning and gender inequality. The film illustrates both the over consumption and the inequity side of the population issue by following Beth, a mother, a child-rights activist and the last sibling of a large American family of twelve, as she discovers the thorny complexities of the population dilemma and highlights a different path to solve it.","popularity":0.2957,"poster_path":"/drWpKoOe3xX2Ov6HjpMf35Wz8la.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother: Caring for 7 Billion","video":false,"vote_average":6.571,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esraa Bani","original_name":"Esraa Bani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself (Population Action International)","credit_id":"55f40f649251414a67002935","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Bartlett","original_name":"Albert Bartlett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Host","credit_id":"55f40f64c3a3686d0b002eae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lester Brown","original_name":"Lester Brown","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself (Earth Policy Institute)","credit_id":"55f40f649251417cfc00220a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Campbell","original_name":"Martha Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself (Venture Strategies)","credit_id":"55f40f65925141666a0003b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Davis","original_name":"Susan Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Herself (BRAC)","credit_id":"55f40f65c3a3686cfd002bed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Dixon","original_name":"Brian Dixon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself (Population Connection)","credit_id":"55f40f659251414e080029b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul R.
