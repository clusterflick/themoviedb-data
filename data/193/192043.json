The technical values are exemplary. The backgrounds are fine, making use of the natural world and excellent sets. The costuming is on a par with that, and the camera-work, although stodgy to the modern eye -- it never moves and the cuts are all leisurely -- are handsomely chosen and get the job done.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/v31CnzDM0Qr7uZ5MkMi0CnxWea5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Figaro's Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Figaro's Wedding","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Maggi","original_name":"Luigi Maggi","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/aNx6cxYjPwq2T5eWNQkRfryjtos.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c9a9251416c910fa1ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1175228","wikidata_id":"Q3794597","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v31CnzDM0Qr7uZ5MkMi0CnxWea5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
