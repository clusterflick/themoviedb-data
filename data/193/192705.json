With them he develops an intimate and poetic film, consisting of portraits of friends, walks through Barcelona and a trip to his native country, Venezuela, where chaos imposes its aesthetic appeal. A complex and fragmented film that shows the world of the filmmaker that sometimes happens to be as absurd and miraculous as a painting by Hieronymus Bosch.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/zdpsuFIHgk9NhL0mOh230BKJOZ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Runaway Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Duque","original_name":"Andrés Duque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hXqbr9aKaINFLAej23jPk694or4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cb19251416c910fd14b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2093086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szAFfh3bMaqjI2TiiPI79yWbI6c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zdpsuFIHgk9NhL0mOh230BKJOZ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"COLOR RUNAWAY DOG // COLOR PERRO QUE HUYE - Andrés Duque - Spain, 2011.","key":"E16q2fnoxdE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-09-04T10:11:32.000Z","id":"66ee0d99b348bea4eb3aeabd"}]}}}
