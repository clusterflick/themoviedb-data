Walking through the city he meets a friend with two young girls, one of whom obviously has to go to Donatello, who enchants her with the most boring and rhetorical saccharine love song. However, the girl is worried about \"all those people who fight for freedom\", so Donatello offers to be a driver in a series of clandestine races that we do not have the pleasure of seeing. Overseeing the entire operation is Don Franco, a sinister man with a Camorra streak who takes the young lover under his wing. Returning from the triumphant series of concerts Gigione discovers that Donatello is involved in a bad circle, and after an inconclusive confrontation with Don Franco, he thinks it would be a good idea to go on a pilgrimage to San Giovanni Rotondo to ask for mercy from Padre Pio.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/1ZFCAxqmyOj7CMjyFwyP6QTb8Py.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quality Sound","origin_country":""},{"id":14398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nobile & Rossini Associati","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Porcheria","title":"Thank You, Padre Pio!","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigione","original_name":"Gigione","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7x4ohYxb6Wm26om4L5eUxV7e1FA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fba87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Donatello","original_name":"Jo Donatello","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/hejGiLNvLSXIvp0Db4QB3AgTVCp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fba8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Allocca","original_name":"Antonio Allocca","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/1ERsGnzl4VEy5jc6lH10t8MDxaE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fba8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172732,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariano Di Martino","original_name":"Mariano Di Martino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fba93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Carbone","original_name":"Fabio Carbone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fba97","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cinzia Profita","original_name":"Cinzia Profita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fba9b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172736,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonella Costagliola","original_name":"Antonella Costagliola","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fbaa7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amedeo Gianfrotta","original_name":"Amedeo Gianfrotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fbaa1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172737,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pasquale Imparato","original_name":"Pasquale Imparato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fbab3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172732,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariano Di Martino","original_name":"Mariano Di Martino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ca69251416c910fbaad","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2177573","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rrvIg3DMRTTU0waS0LM8unDKyYz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGSvrz0Q9pmMQPh0FXT7DlmWqGZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNKsUYgolhOidF7fHe8sS5bVw65.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1248,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/iD4cMH77OCaeyBRkGUVZ0kTmZqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":834},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1ZFCAxqmyOj7CMjyFwyP6QTb8Py.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
