It was originally made as a private thank-you gift from Ghibli to John Lasseter, the Lasseter-San of the title. The show appears similar to a home movie, or private documentary.  This footage includes snippets from some of Miyazaki's films, as well as some Pixar shorts. The most striking part were clips from Porco Rosso, interchanging with images of Miyazaki flying a red double-decker.","popularity":0.7121,"poster_path":"/aseEArn89iC7ie8PiDOWEmGwnjT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10342,"logo_path":"/uFuxPEZRUcBTEiYIxjHJq62Vr77.png","name":"Studio Ghibli","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12424,"logo_path":"/nBer3gCkrK5yCG3Q0sJhFSuwZIk.png","name":"TV Man Union","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The More Than 20 Year Friendship Between Hayao Miyazaki and John Lasseter Behind Spirited Away's Academy Award Win","title":"Lasseter-san, Thank You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Merci, Lasseter-san","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Thank You, Lasseter-san","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Lasseter-san, arigatou","type":"Roumaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Lasseter-san, arigatō","type":"Rōmaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hayao Miyazaki","original_name":"宮崎駿","popularity":2.0537,"profile_path":"/ouhjt9KugzhWtdEyBPipihB3ic8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ecfce6796386400246d6235","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Lasseter","original_name":"John Lasseter","popularity":0.7991,"profile_path":"/7EdqiNbr4FRjIhKHyPPdFfEEEFG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ecfce9a5c071b001d284aa6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshio Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木敏夫","popularity":0.5891,"profile_path":"/h8KzdSl5kIHgXputSBhxDZ1CA1g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself / Narrator","credit_id":"5ecfd04921c4ca001fdc5e28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rex Jones","original_name":"Rex Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ecfd0725c071b001e2a861c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657856,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kou Seki","original_name":"Kou Seki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecfd3e6aaec71001f684441","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657859,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoshiko Saitou","original_name":"Yoshiko Saitou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecfd43396386400226c5f0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshio Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木敏夫","popularity":0.5891,"profile_path":"/h8KzdSl5kIHgXputSBhxDZ1CA1g.jpg","credit_id":"5ecfd47b3dc3130021c84c4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshio Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木敏夫","popularity":0.5891,"profile_path":"/h8KzdSl5kIHgXputSBhxDZ1CA1g.jpg","credit_id":"5ecfd988e61e6d001ecdf71e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Junichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤順一","popularity":0.5547,"profile_path":"/ckKxvO5rmHG9nh4ZarKffR3iYUv.jpg","credit_id":"6703b2a63afc91a5f1138e3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Junichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤順一","popularity":0.5547,"profile_path":"/ckKxvO5rmHG9nh4ZarKffR3iYUv.jpg","credit_id":"6703b2ff18a8b49d32138e0e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Compositing Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6201778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/eSN7bf7w19xYrh50a61npRtZH67.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMo4pHqQbgW3v88OCmzduaqz1e5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aseEArn89iC7ie8PiDOWEmGwnjT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11321,"name":"animated scene"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
