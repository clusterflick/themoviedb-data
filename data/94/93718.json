The trial (conducted in rhyme) starts with a car that was in a hit-and-run accident, followed by a sports car whose sins are peeling rubber and general hot-rodding, followed by a heap, on trial for lack of safety. Next, a number of safety equipment designers testify that, despite their best efforts, the accident rate keeps rising. Through all this, the defense lawyer declines to ask questions. A highway designer bemoans the problems on his beautiful roads. At last, defense. He shows a number of scenarios, pointing out that the real problem isn't the car but the driver. Everyone left the courtroom, declaring the car not guilty, and drove politely again, for a little while.","popularity":0.7763,"poster_path":"/of3jyT902J2wO1dopLL8y63vBsk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Anyburg U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Conried","original_name":"Hans Conried","popularity":0.6636,"profile_path":"/rftuT9tTEqVoEDqqJZEQicnXHVH.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Prosecutor","credit_id":"52fe493c9251416c750c17f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurl Ravenscroft","original_name":"Thurl Ravenscroft","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":"/bG8r0mdyU0lvhllYAAjRAJupWqq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Cyrus P.
