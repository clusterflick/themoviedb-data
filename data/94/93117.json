The set includes quintessential hits about loving and letting go from the seven-time Grammy winner’s days as a confessional rock phenomenon: “All I Really Want,” “Hands Clean,” “Thank U” and “Uninvited.” The singer/songwriter also introduces fans to her latest and most adventurous album, So-Called Chaos, with songs including “Eight Easy Steps,” and “Excuses,” among others. The honest, unadulterated performance reflects Morissette’s move away from her days as a rancorous 90’s rocker, and into the mode of mature musician ready to experiment with her strengths. Morissette’s enduring introspection, continual evolution and evocative stage presence shine in this performance.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alanis Morissette: Head Over Feet","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0273071","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
