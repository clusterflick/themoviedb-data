The story is taken from a youth-oriented novel in which Dipu, a boy belonging to the educated class, is teased by the school bully but eventually forms a deep relationship with him. The rest is totally escapist in nature, including a scene in which the two youths manage to capture single-handedly an entire group of robbers.","popularity":0.2263,"poster_path":"/4Gz1HkpZhwWpyuual7eytb5CBj9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"1996-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An adventure story for young boys.","title":"Dipu Number 2","video":false,"vote_average":9.4,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arun","original_name":"Arun","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Dipu","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c02ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shubashish","original_name":"Shubashish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"Tariq","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c030f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bulbul Ahmed","original_name":"Bulbul Ahmed","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/9BghTCzQWhoM1sHpNyOWzNKn67s.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Dipu's father","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c02eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1758968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobita","original_name":"Bobita","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/5YOf0WizAyHUEIArJaIyLBbmRNB.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Dipu's Mother","credit_id":"67109da21f9d0ee4b8c9d0b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forhad","original_name":"Forhad","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Babu","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c02f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolly Johur","original_name":"Dolly Johur","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/qve5ezmCTOHVgvPwJQJ3Oe16Zwi.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Tariq's mother","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c02fb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mashfiq","original_name":"Mashfiq","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Tipu","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c0303","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Golam Mostafa","original_name":"Golam Mostafa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Jamshed Chacha","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c0307","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shafquat","original_name":"Shafquat","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Shajjad","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c030b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abul Khair","original_name":"Abul Khair","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/wRGL6WMgUzhttF3fOqEuThPQJYL.jpg","cast_id":1012,"character":"School teacher","credit_id":"5eaef1f271f095001fad8b3b","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morshedul Islam","original_name":"Morshedul Islam","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/xkpa1wfo6Vw0e51TQZVg3Go7xiy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c02e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Muhammed Zafar Iqbal","original_name":"Muhammed Zafar Iqbal","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/9DNmwxkdwZqZ0kJv8HoxS8d6oqw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49309251416c750c02e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1935109","wikidata_id":"Q16345587","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"bn","file_path":"/4Gz1HkpZhwWpyuual7eytb5CBj9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"bn","file_path":"/6NmxF1pnfYlPiUZz8GKqUU7aZQP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
