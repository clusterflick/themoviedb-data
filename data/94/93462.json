However, they quickly find the film too depressing. Ducking into a nightclub, they discover a young Manhattan comedienne and decide instead to follow her as she makes the circuit of auditions in L.A. as she tries to get a TV pilot. Unfortunately, she has failed to tell her boyfriend of this move. He decides he will trail her out west. There, the boyfriend runs into an old friend who has already made a break on a TV pilot. Seizing the opportunity, the actress turns her attentions to the established actor. However, the actress goes nowhere in auditions, but her ex-boyfriend is suddenly noticed and becomes the next hot prospect.","popularity":3.7633,"poster_path":"/k9Gy2pK3ypDyM9FWR9fAON4TVD2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilot Season Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who's the Caboose?","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Silverman","original_name":"Sarah Silverman","popularity":0.973,"profile_path":"/g5G711XyVokJm2RoItpkaHa8mkQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"52fe492d9251416c750bfdfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Dick","original_name":"Andy Dick","popularity":0.8105,"profile_path":"/n4WT4oYoYrzSGAanlWPsneCzBPk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jason Reemer","credit_id":"52fe492d9251416c750bfe09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.
