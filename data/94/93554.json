Miller, Lucky Ghost is amusing low-brow fare that exploits the more base, stereotypical elements of old-time black life (chicken thievin', gamblin', runnin' from ghosteses) for laughs -- sort of like the BET of its day. Mantan and Miller win a house-cum-casino in a craps game, only to discover that the deceased former owners aren't too pleased that their old home is being used for \"jitterbugging, jiving, and hullaballooing\". I hate hullaballooing. The ghosts decide to scare everyone off by opening doors and windows, pulling out chairs, even playing the drums.","popularity":0.4556,"poster_path":"/o0zjIYzZU1qMt4VN0r7g6sxejv1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dixie National Pictures Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You Can Bet Your Bottom Dollar It's THRILLING - EXCITING - FUNNY!","title":"Lucky Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mantan Moreland","original_name":"Mantan Moreland","popularity":0.2446,"profile_path":"/35Alz2weFGRVf5PruGF3oxDrPzi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Washington","credit_id":"52fe49319251416c750c04d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.E.
