The city of Victoria was rumored in the 1980's to be the second worldwide 'capital of Satanism' after Geneva, Switzerland. Dark Paradox explores the idea that this myth was not only partially true but also partially inaccurate in suggesting the cult activity was 'Satanic' when in fact it was based on the worship of ancient extraterrestrial 'elder gods' in the vein of HP Lovecraft's fiction.","popularity":0.1809,"poster_path":"/cZNsdxyqgCIUfEOSNiUeFt9REB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontline
