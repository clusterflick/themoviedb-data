We meet some at Gibsonton, Florida, where carnival folk winter. They talk about their lives and accomplishments. The camera also goes on the road to visit a grandfather with a distinctive face, a legless mechanic from Kentucky on a second honeymoon in LA, a marathon runner and motivational speaker who has no feet, a karate student with partial limbs, and an armless, down-to-earth mom in Texas.","popularity":0.6283,"poster_path":"/bz6zt7HyKulkJqZBVESvX1byGa1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trans-Atlantic Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":10313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral Bellevue Pathé","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":24315,"logo_path":null,"name":"TMS Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of a modern-day Elephant Man… and other human oddities.","title":"Being Different","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Seres diferentes: Monstruos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Plummer","original_name":"Christopher Plummer","popularity":1.7962,"profile_path":"/iZh3s9Vy9vYD4DYnAda6C1kdeco.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self (Narrator) (voice)","credit_id":"5a00e5fa925141573a0069ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Barty","original_name":"Billy Barty","popularity":0.6853,"profile_path":"/b8Q8bD1AaXFDBpAg4pDBkb7Z1Nh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e57dc3a36807110069b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Melvin","original_name":"Bob Melvin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self (The Man with Two Faces)","credit_id":"5a00e5b092514156e6006aab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Elaine Allen","original_name":"Sandra Elaine Allen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Tallest woman in the world)","credit_id":"5a00e5839251415745006831","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo-Ann Cantilla","original_name":"Jo-Ann Cantilla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e58bc3a36807200063ca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Capps","original_name":"Louise Capps","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e592c3a36807200063d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Fishe","original_name":"Paul Fishe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (729 lb man)","credit_id":"5a00e59ac3a36807200063e2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Galyon","original_name":"Ronnie Galyon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e5a2c3a36806f60063d2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnie Galyon","original_name":"Donnie Galyon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e5a9925141572e006730","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolly Reagan","original_name":"Dolly Reagan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self (The Human Doll)","credit_id":"5a00e5be925141572e006746","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Strudwick","original_name":"Peter Strudwick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e5ca92514157080066e6","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1822882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett Bejano","original_name":"Emmett Bejano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e6019251415718006989","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1822884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percilla Bejano","original_name":"Percilla Bejano","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a00e61b925141572e0067c4","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johann K.
