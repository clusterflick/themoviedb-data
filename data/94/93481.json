A quiet take: A living room, a woman in an armchair. Her husband opens the door, kisses her, then moves out of the picture accompanied by a camera pan, his wife follows after him. In Arnold's film the sequence takes 16 minutes. Cadre by cadre, it becomes an exciting tango of movements. But Pièce Touchée is more than just a matter of forms; The reflections, distortions and delays it displays challenge cinema's stable system of space and time.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/7OfwrAo9oLqxUDh3puzsEIoEUJV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pièce touchée","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Arnold","original_name":"Martin Arnold","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/DerL8FUGOvBUi8h6b4KyM7tPJr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe492e9251416c750bff57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098098","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74jvzfHpS8toa2fIOuc1EY7rpN1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7OfwrAo9oLqxUDh3puzsEIoEUJV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Cannes)","release_date":"1990-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (New York)","release_date":"1990-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
