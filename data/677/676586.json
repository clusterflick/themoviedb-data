A magician botches his trick of sawing a woman in half, and loses his assistant’s legs. An overequipped hiker gets stuck in the elevator for several days. An old man falls in love with a runaway pair of legs. A mother asks her neighbour to look after her children on the eve of Saint-Festin… In one building, the lives of ten next-door neighbours, or the neighbours of neighbours, intertwine as they grapple with the dramas, joys, surprises and dangers of everyday life.","popularity":0.7305,"poster_path":"/8CPXYQIvcML5mtvgGVDY9BIyRmf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72654,"logo_path":"/qAGfpZE53RKgPWyiWYnIUdzpPrb.png","name":"Lardux
