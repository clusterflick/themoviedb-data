But unlike Haring and Basquiat, who both died tragically young, Kenny lived through cataclysmic shifts in the East Village as well as the ravages of AIDS and economic depression.  'When Worlds Collide' is about the art of fun, about living life out loud, despite setbacks, and about Kenny Scharf’s particular do-it- yourself, high-tone, technicolor artistic vision.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/wugYcpWtQJGDrlKtHJEP7MQ3PwK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curatorial","origin_country":""},{"id":85350,"logo_path":"/cgEjGH3gxf1wbN6hqns2gyka3z5.png","name":"Green Hummingbird Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":151259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maliable Films","origin_country":""},{"id":3728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mangusta Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":151260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Octopus Originals","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kenny Scharf: When Worlds Collide","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Basch","original_name":"Max Basch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e53006aa76ac50015a50bcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malia Scharf","original_name":"Malia Scharf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e53005ed2c0c10013a35b01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11720064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bXNazqMKv7lCAt3MItH4przsUnl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wugYcpWtQJGDrlKtHJEP7MQ3PwK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
