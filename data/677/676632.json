A girl's doll carriage rolls toward a busy street while her father ignores her to talk to a friend; an impatient husband waits for his wife to cook his egg; lovers enjoy a last embrace as a man – her husband? – climbs the stairs. The friends part and the father looks for his daughter; the egg timer rings; the husband returns. Five minutes are almost up, but little is as we expect it.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2000-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Be Continued...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linus Tunström","original_name":"Linus Tunström","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/vRdsrr64B6wz9VrDjDMUDvvMkdm.jpg","credit_id":"5e542c4118864b0014004446","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0276567","wikidata_id":"Q21074798","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2000-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
