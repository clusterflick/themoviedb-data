Now it is 1972. The film centers on a young boy, who is failing in school, and grounded from going on Passover trips with his classmates. Instead he must visit private academies (including military school) with his parents, who want him to do better in school. Foreshadowing to the coming war in 1973 and the defeat of euphoria.","popularity":0.3254,"poster_path":"/p9dHupzHRRNEflGwYhz7vbBTfBR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Was No War in '72","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Abulafia","original_name":"Adam Abulafia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e549cbaf48b340013748562","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":560270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nataly Attiya","original_name":"Nataly Attiya","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e549cc215959f0017a7ac64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmuel Edelman","original_name":"Shmuel Edelman","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/stwlmxotpBVoVUWlkdTerlojvnl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e549cc9f48b340017744a58","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ava Haddad","original_name":"Ava Haddad","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e549cd015959f0019a79d68","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elon Eysh","original_name":"Elon Eysh","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e549cd615959f0019a79d74","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53096,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tova Ascher","original_name":"Tova Ascher","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60a163fe51e6ab004075629a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4812357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iftach Kerzner","original_name":"Iftach Kerzner","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"668807941dbbc5b02cb0a2da","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53096,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tova Ascher","original_name":"Tova Ascher","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a16432d8f44e0059f7e7ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dror Moreh","original_name":"Dror Moreh","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a16427596a910057a054cd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":414585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aviv Geffen","original_name":"Aviv Geffen","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/i9Q4Twq5ZwxcgiMklTkM9oWhAHS.jpg","credit_id":"60a164146c1e0400295b04c7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kreiner","original_name":"David Kreiner","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e549c5535811d00135a0b03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kreiner","original_name":"David Kreiner","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e549c5035811d00135a0aef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0112428","wikidata_id":"Q6879694","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8GaQxxZ81LsC71QiHvfUo0jrgor.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/p9dHupzHRRNEflGwYhz7vbBTfBR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
