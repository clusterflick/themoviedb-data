She encounters an old black man with an unforgettable story. Eugene Bullard, the first black fighter pilot… who now works as an elevator operator at the Rockefeller Center. No sooner does Louise begin her investigation, than Eugene disappears into the Great South to atone for his sins. He flees in the face of racial hatred but also his own story of heroism. Eugene’s life reads as an epic tale. But a mystery remains at the heart of this story, a moment of treason and loss. With his death imminent, Eugene knows that only the truth can redeem him. And only Louise, catching up with him at last, has unearthed the truth.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/aEmfVA8Tg58UVXrfXFilFPt9Wpd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79189,"logo_path":"/yPWHBZdThBtCyWbe07gKj37g6LL.png","name":"La Luna Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Black Swallow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"All Blood Runs Red","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Jean Gorry","original_name":"Louis Jean Gorry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e546ac3a93d2500134deb95","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Jean Gorry","original_name":"Louis Jean Gorry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e546a5f15959f0015a74b4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Caroline Vermalle","original_name":"Caroline Vermalle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e546aa1a93d2500134deb0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Jean Gorry","original_name":"Louis Jean Gorry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e546abb18864b00180099eb","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Jean Gorry","original_name":"Louis Jean Gorry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e546aa918864b0014008ff4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aEmfVA8Tg58UVXrfXFilFPt9Wpd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xT9abUNKZLI4zW91UTQUj6KlDG6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
