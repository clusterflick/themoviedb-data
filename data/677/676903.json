One of these strange solar activities caused the formation of a small asteroid the size of the palm of a hand, which ended up on planet Earth, landing in San Juan Del Mezquital Zacatecas. By then, Maximiliano and his friends had finally killed their eternal rival, a cattle rustler named Salomon Montengro. However, days after killing him, they accidentally came across the Sun Stone and gained great powers. Feeling pressured by their enemies, Salomon Montengro's colleagues, Maximiliano and his friends, hid the Sun Stone in the most unlikely place: in Salomon Montengro's tomb. Now that Salomon Montengro was revived thanks to the Sun Stone, he plans to take revenge on Maximiliano and his friends. To do so, he killed his own colleagues and revived them, turning them into the living dead.","popularity":0.1083,"poster_path":"/ilxgKWs5EyXhCuTONRomeBNLXIb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La piedra solar","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Solar Stone","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4690239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Luis Arellano Guerra","original_name":"Jorge Luis Arellano Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67fe09813110bd82dfad5fb9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4690239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Luis Arellano Guerra","original_name":"Jorge Luis Arellano Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6633fd40358da7012754c52e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6723564","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ilxgKWs5EyXhCuTONRomeBNLXIb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgjKVzKqS6Z9GRocp3ZAlUuwiam.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12377,"name":"zombie"},{"id":186565,"name":"zombie apocalypse"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"},{"id":324551,"name":"zombie movie"},{"id":342832,"name":"sci-fi"},{"id":344183,"name":"zombie horror"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
