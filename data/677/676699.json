JoÃ«l Perrotte undertook that surgery in 2007. After becoming mute, his first reaction was to retreat from the outside world, in the basement of his home. Thanks to his wife's support, he surfaced back, and found the strength to learn a new voice and become part of the society. The film tells the story of this extraordinary metamorphosis.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8XKYRbfwyjnLjJ9oAGdFJ8jToTT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into The World (Au Monde)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":548823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Bisson","original_name":"Christophe Bisson","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e545b36f48b34001573d5b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1270678,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claire Atherton","original_name":"Claire Atherton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e545b4218864b001200918a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8XKYRbfwyjnLjJ9oAGdFJ8jToTT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":739}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
