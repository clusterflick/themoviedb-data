Cinema taught viewers how they had to see it, worse, it showed directors how they had to film it. Based on quotations from early cinema films, Contar el amor discusses the role of sex and violence as central themes in our increasingly broad but, at the same time, less pluralistic audiovisual universe.","popularity":0.269,"poster_path":"/cB55nJbqMVdWbeaAzm7nPN7gdep.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2020-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contar
