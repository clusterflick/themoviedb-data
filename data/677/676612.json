Nato is Ryan's cousin and best friend, and his father has a legal work permit. Together, the children live their seemingly normal everyday lives in the shadow of the constant fear of deportation.  The film focuses on the children of foreign workers. In addition to a typical childhood existence, these children are forced to deal with a complex reality that includes tough questions as to their identity. The film follows the children's dreams, their games and their yearnings in a reality where the future is forever frightening and unknown.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":99641,"logo_path":null,"name":"T.T.V Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":22232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reshet Broadcasting","origin_country":""},{"id":78832,"logo_path":null,"name":"the new Israeli Foundation for Cinema & TV,","origin_country":""},{"id":86910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruth Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2003-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do They Catch Children Too?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hedva Galili-Smolinsky","original_name":"Hedva Galili-Smolinsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e541e2aa76ac50011a6e54d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hedva Galili-Smolinsky","original_name":"Hedva Galili-Smolinsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e541e3ca93d2500174daf73","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549154,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zafrir Kochanovsky","original_name":"Zafrir Kochanovsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e541e5ea93d2500134d7588","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miri Ezra","original_name":"Miri Ezra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e541e6fa76ac50015a70c79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549157,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yoav Kush","original_name":"Yoav Kush","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e541e7f35811d00195aabd3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549161,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Haim Yafim Kuchok","original_name":"Haim Yafim Kuchok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e541ee1a93d2500154d1688","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"Hamilton Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2004-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"New York Sephardic Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2003-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"DocAviv International Film Festival","release_date":"2003-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Promo 2- DO THEY CATCH CHILDREN TOO? 2003","key":"E2yDNbRCou4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-30T07:47:30.000Z","id":"5e54225615959f0017a6ec60"}]}}}
