This has always been one of my most memorable railanning trips, and as time passes, the video that I shot has become more and more priceless. Every train had a caboose. CP & CN stuck to their own sides of The Fraser & Thompson River Canyons (the direction of the train now dictates the side they use).The British Columbia Railway was healthy, and still running lots of big ALCO/MLW Locomotives! The Royal Hudson Steam excursion was in full service. No doubt one thing remains constant, whether it be 1987 or present… the scenery is SPECTACULAR.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":243183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broken Knuckle Video Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Railfanning in Southwest British Columbia, 1987","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
