But Grandpa has become forgetful lately. In fact, he has left doors unlocked and was found wandering streets, disorientated and lost, worrying signs that raise a red flag about a particular condition that Yau-yau’s mother has dealt with up close and personal – Alzheimer’s. Grandpa responds in defensive denial until one day he breaks a daily pattern and begins a spiralling deterioration that Yau-yau is still too young to comprehend.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of the Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
