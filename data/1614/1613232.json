When he went back to Egypt, he dealt with being different, and Rap was the only way to express his feelings and prove himself.  Rap gave Nubi the opportunity to be heard by people of his age who believe in him and his type of art.  He sings a new genre, a mix between Southern Egyptian culture and trap music, trying to keep pace with the rap scene in Egypt.  NUBI has a dream of holding a concert in the city of -Aswan-, specifically in Nubia, by following the steps of his idol, Mounir, the famous Nubian singer in Egypt, who experienced the same journey of being a stranger by just having dark skin. NUBI believes that singing is a gift God gave him, and the mic is from heaven.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9c5Scl8DaiUWtL4HKFkoQbFbgKK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2023-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NUBI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"NUBI","original_name":"NUBI","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6961b910f6078ed888364573","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MOMEN RIHAN","original_name":"MOMEN RIHAN","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6961b9e5b6b74e9a891713f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"NASAIR","original_name":"NASAIR","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6961b9f7026665dff53d66b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"ISSA & ASSOUAD","original_name":"ISSA & ASSOUAD","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6961ba069d38df87cf364573","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4274067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marwan Tarek","original_name":"مروان طارق","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/7gKj3Qr3u5GY9CVSb4onKHjt6ty.jpg","credit_id":"6961b92c9d38df87cf364560","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4274067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marwan Tarek","original_name":"مروان طارق","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/7gKj3Qr3u5GY9CVSb4onKHjt6ty.jpg","credit_id":"6961b93db1832e498bf403c2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alaa Qatosh","original_name":"Alaa Qatosh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6961b94ed8c544d910bd35f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5181129,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"khaled othman","original_name":"khaled othman","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6961b96472e76980b8bd3657","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amr Ali","original_name":"Amr Ali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6961b97d50a20b1e74d14aa5","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929294,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Magic","original_name":"Magic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6961b99d50a20b1e74d14aaa","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929361,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"MOHAMED OSAMA LOTFY","original_name":"MOHAMED OSAMA LOTFY","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6961b9b4f0fc232535b54c5f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9c5Scl8DaiUWtL4HKFkoQbFbgKK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
