For this 40th anniversary concert from 2019 at the stunning Philharmonie de Paris, core artists from “Les Arts Flo” reunite to perform some of the ensemble’s trademark pieces, from Lully’s Atys—a long-forgotten masterpiece they revived in 1987 over 230 years after its last performance—to the great operas of Rameau and gems by the likes of Charpentier, Purcell, and Handel.  This celebratory concert features another first for the storied ensemble, as Christie shares conducting duties with Paul Agnew! Riveting from beginning to end, this Baroque Odyssey encapsulates all the qualities—world-class instrumentalists, impeccable Baroque vocalists, cannily chosen repertoire—that have made Les Arts Florissants such a beloved and enduring fixture in the classical world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63243,"logo_path":null,"name":"CLC Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":18916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tangaro","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":79626,"logo_path":"/evt7rNSFXOHCMyDb3Pj1CqjASvE.png","name":"Les Arts Florissants","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":25564,"logo_path":"/hOMyGLs7mSWoDzVkGDYgK0BdVo6.png","name":"Mezzo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":117263,"logo_path":"/fel0PKWigARrdOGvxQbZ2T1hCV5.png","name":"Radio France","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":139828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kien Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Baroque Odyssey: Les Arts Florissants celebrates 40 years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Arts Florissants","original_name":"Les Arts Florissants","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"6962e7a490866e59ec3d6f13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Christie","original_name":"William Christie","popularity":0.4579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6962e6aa7db7a5eb70171b92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Agnew","original_name":"Paul Agnew","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6962e801b323915340171bac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandrine Piau","original_name":"Sandrine Piau","popularity":0.1322,"profile_path":"/oTvtZoc68tqNPoEvQLz8OUxw8TS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"6962e83427d260bab8bd3acf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2157586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea Desandre","original_name":"Lea Desandre","popularity":0.3035,"profile_path":"/clx6mN9SwSINodSJGwv313fbPKx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mezzo-soprano","credit_id":"6962e85014f7ca1343bd3b86","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Dumaux","original_name":"Christophe Dumaux","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/stKEgTLXSaAOm5nqjXMyOWrfYtj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Contre-ténor","credit_id":"6962e872c94ecd6a763d6d96","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Beekman","original_name":"Marcel Beekman","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ténor","credit_id":"6962e88bc37bd4fe193d6d06","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Mauillon","original_name":"Marc Mauillon","popularity":0.2013,"profile_path":"/b9QkzprNAy1iMTgaCS0flDHzoYH.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Baryton","credit_id":"6962e8ae77d99ef903b5529c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisandro Abadie","original_name":"Lisandro Abadie","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Basse","credit_id":"6962e8cf2f456c204a171d38","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Corentin Leconte","original_name":"Corentin Leconte","popularity":0.2961,"profile_path":"/cn0ds6eV2AffuZNfTpdjlY1ceOD.jpg","credit_id":"6962e902b6b74e9a89171a7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13629360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253634,"name":"baroque music"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
