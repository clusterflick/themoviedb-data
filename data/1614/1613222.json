But there was always an unanswered question lurking: was It, in fact, On? But finally, a movie slithered out of “This film was not screened for critics” slop heap and delivered an unambiguous, if confusingly punctuated proclamation: Dancin’: It’s On!  Let’s not bury the lede here: This is a Teen Dance Movie from the guy who directed Space Mutiny. Turns out choreography was his true passion, in the same way that “freezer-space optimization” was Jeffrey Dahmer’s. But now that whole hula hoop dance sequence in Space Mutiny makes a lot more sense, right? It does not make it better, sexier, or less mortifying, but it at least makes more sense!  Pack your bags for Panama City, queue up one of the absolute weirdest songs in the history of RiffTrax soundtracks, and join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for Dancin’: It’s On!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lI0qe7fpRcCl3AYen7m2qFZ9Wh3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax: Dancin': It's On!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21294138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lI0qe7fpRcCl3AYen7m2qFZ9Wh3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
