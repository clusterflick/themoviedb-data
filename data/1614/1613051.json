A constant stream of boys and men are coming into the sausage factory and depositing with the butchers, dogs, cats and various other animals, which are thrown into the sausage machine by one of the Dutchmen, while the other turns the handle, and grinds out yard after yard of finished sausage. A Chinaman finally appears with a dog and cat for sale. The Chinaman becomes curious about the inside workings of the machine, and stands leaning over the mechanism. The Dutchmen slip around behind John and tip him head foremost into the machine. They then proceed to grind him up, and out comes a long string of rats instead of sausages. This forms a very ludicrous finish to the picture, which is one of our most laughable comic subjects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1901-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Making Sausages","title":"Fun in a Butcher Shop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0352358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1901-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
