Every mindset shift, every lesson, every failure, and every realization has shaped the person I’m becoming.\r This video is where I finally begin to share that journey — my life philosophy, my experiences, and what I’ve learned along the way. It’s about self-awareness, discipline, and becoming your truest self from the inside out.\r I’m not here to teach; I’m here to share — to grow with you, not above you.\r If you believe that real strength comes from within, you’ll find something here for you.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Inner Philosophy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5931349,"name":"Aditi Singh Rathore","original_name":"Aditi Singh Rathore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6963311be6255555765968d0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
