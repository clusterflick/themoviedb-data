Withdrawn and unstable, he struggles to separate reality from imagination as his past begins to resurface. His children, shaped by years of emotional distance, seek answers about the event that fractured their family decades earlier. As they investigate, they are drawn into a reality shaped by repression and unresolved consequences. Dante soon realizes he is being followed by a mysterious presence known as Virgil, who acts as both guide and adversary. Through a series of mental trials and mind games, Virgil forces Dante to confront distorted recollections, moral failures, and the true nature of the energy-gathering. As past and present collide, Dante and his children face conflicting truths about what really happened.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inferno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
