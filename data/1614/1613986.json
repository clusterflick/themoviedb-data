Through the process he learns that he needs to dance for no one else but himself...  If you look up “joy” in the dictionary, you’ll see a picture of Parker Seaman doing a jeté. In the effortless comedy Dancer Boy, Parker seeks the approval of his adult friends by entering a dance competition popularized by tween-aged girls, in order to prove that he is, in fact, a good dancer. I cannot get enough of this film. It reminds me of the genius of early Christopher Guest but has a freshness perfectly ripe for 2021. Dancer boy blurs the line between fiction and reality by including hilarious and precious footage of young Parker dancing in the Showstoppers American Dance Competition. I know the film was designed to make me laugh, but I was super caught off guard when I cried real tears at the ending. Maybe I’m just a sucker, but I love this one.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hMNL9K7WNTPfi7Xp8HvRJvn6uhZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":285854,"logo_path":null,"name":"documentry+","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancer Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"dan parker","original_name":"dan parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6963a16e9d38df87cf365008","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Parker Seaman","original_name":"Parker Seaman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963a073ff2cbc72321d8e60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Parker Seaman","original_name":"Parker Seaman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963a08caa8328ff74b55615","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5932064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Scott","original_name":"Evan Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6963a09c9347ebdc6cf40eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hMNL9K7WNTPfi7Xp8HvRJvn6uhZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
