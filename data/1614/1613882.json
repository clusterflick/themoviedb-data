Housing men from the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, it becomes a modern-day Tower of Babel. Residents find solace in communal activities like cooking and praying, connecting to their roots. It's only in sleep that they break free from the migration center, dreaming of their homelands - the plains of Africa, bustling streets of India, and war-torn cities of the Middle East. Over time, as walls are repainted and relationships form between migrants and staff, the center changes. A year later, it empties suddenly, leaving behind a silence and a reminder of the impermanence of life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Po dangum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
