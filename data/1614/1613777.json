Rather than a retrospective, it functions as a navigable digital space where music, visual art, and fragmented narratives merge. Visitors wander through shifting environments populated by distorted figures, abstract architecture, and audiovisual installations that respond to movement and proximity. The exhibition translates the albums’ themes of alienation, anxiety, and technological unease into an immersive experience, inviting users to lose themselves in a dreamlike, unstable world where sound and image dissolve traditional boundaries.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sgU3vcLaS25mUIMuBhfDxATwLCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KID A MNESIA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Yorke","original_name":"Thom Yorke","popularity":1.471,"profile_path":"/kVBSJNIMqQCMIkA84ENSz2YMhKj.jpg","credit_id":"6963138feb03527b571d8b5c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Yorke","original_name":"Thom Yorke","popularity":1.471,"profile_path":"/kVBSJNIMqQCMIkA84ENSz2YMhKj.jpg","credit_id":"696313d4c401c234701d8db9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Godrich","original_name":"Nigel Godrich","popularity":0.184,"profile_path":"/1vmCVU9C7rqTegIgNeI7ZwyAwGN.jpg","credit_id":"696313ed5c3753ab6bbd3b3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5931185,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sean Evans","original_name":"Sean Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69631412c592b96dcc59697d","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":773,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sgU3vcLaS25mUIMuBhfDxATwLCy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
