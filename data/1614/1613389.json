Perched on a tiny outcrop of rock at the edge of the Atlantic, ' the Bishop ' has something special about it for the Trinity House officers who man Britain's light-houses. It's the last lighthouse for westward-bound ships, and the last still operating almost as it did under Queen Victoria's patronage. Soon, it may be replaced by an unmanned light, but in this ruggedly beautiful documentary, Tony Parker talks with the men who still maintain their lonely vigil in the ' Ships' Graveyard,' off the Isles of Scilly.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1973: Life on the LAST LIGHTHOUSE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Parker","original_name":"Tony Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"69622efaa8b14792f9d14a91","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5929815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Garrard","original_name":"David Garrard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69622ed2e625555576596362","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38936113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
