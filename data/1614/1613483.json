The project supports the business activities of women’s rural associations in the region of Mopti, in Mali, by providing microcredits. These are small sums of money lent to people from the disadvantaged classes in developing countries in order to create micro-businesses. After a year’s experience, the film, which was shot in the summer of 2003, reports on the use of these microcredits by showing the women’s activities (breeding, market gardening, fishing...) and follows Lalia, a member of the Not For Profit organisation \"Prométhée\" and president of \"Debo Association\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le jardin de Lalia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1399654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole Roussopoulos","original_name":"Carole Roussopoulos","popularity":0.2732,"profile_path":"/kys5CA7cZbjEnm45OduTEhTsbo9.jpg","credit_id":"69625acc36cd9d4f653d694a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5930012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Zen-Ruffinen","original_name":"Anne Zen-Ruffinen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69625aeb5c3753ab6bbd36a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
