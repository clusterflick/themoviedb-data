This DVD celebrates his fiftieth anniversary as a professional musician. Recorded at Germany's Hot Jazz Festival 2002, he presents his new, eleven piece Big Chris Barber Band. And what a pleasure it is - the trombonist and his virtuoso bandmates confidently switch between New Orleans jazz and a tribute to the great Duke Ellington, playing swinging blues, and managing to inject new life into old favorites like Sweet Georgia Brown.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6Swd4Yxu2YhdsCrvDaH3xh2cJ3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Chris Barber Band: Hot Jazz Festival Europa Park","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Swd4Yxu2YhdsCrvDaH3xh2cJ3d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
