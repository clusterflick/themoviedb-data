It's a \"great day for the beach\" when our handsome, likable California surfer-blond hero runs into some pals. Unused to alcohol, he gets very high on buddy Joe's vodka (stashed in a 7-Up bottle), leaving him ill-equipped to drive the car he's just brought home. Things get ever more ghoulish as he witnesses the bleak and tearful events that follow his tragic demise. One assumes many a classroom was left either giggling or traumatized (or both) as he screams his final pleas to God as he's being buried. That's edutainment!","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/8yAkPvOjZp4pmRmNlnFbxvgLVvw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gordon-Kerckhoff Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"I can't be dead!
