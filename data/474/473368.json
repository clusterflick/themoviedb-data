Asylum seekers, businessmen, doctors, lawyers, and students sit side-by-side and immerse themselves in polite, if stilted, conversation. However, tensions and misunderstandings occur as the nuances which each participant attempts to express become lost as they struggle to access the language. But despite their differences - and linguistic limitations - the disparate group of strangers in a foreign land find, in the small gestures and subtle looks between the words, a way towards understanding.","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":"/9LpL9eoyUOjqR1kqvmKeAfJSE3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schaller 08 Film- und Fernsehgärtnerei","origin_country":""},{"id":102383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supersonicglide","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atelier de conversation","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Lecouturier","original_name":"Adrien Lecouturier","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653fd911cc9683012cf51a50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernhard Braunstein","original_name":"Bernhard Braunstein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653fd91fe894a6011ca4d9e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500269,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roland Stöttinger","original_name":"Roland Stöttinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dd06ffddd52d007c81409f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernhard Braunstein","original_name":"Bernhard Braunstein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0848c89251414c23017672","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernhard Braunstein","original_name":"Bernhard Braunstein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0848d1c3a368341c01755e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7410124","wikidata_id":"Q54076791","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yUQLU1Q5fMc9Naw8QlT3f2kIj4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9LpL9eoyUOjqR1kqvmKeAfJSE3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522},{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6PZnWz8ICrkbmXLAFLiWb0nMleZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1198}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
