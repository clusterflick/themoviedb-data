Voices of women describe their heightened exposure to the risks of lung cancer, miscarriage, Down syndrome or neurological damage. Echoing the way that the nuclear workers’ bodies are harmed by exposure to radiations, the filmstrip is constantly overexposed, burned to the point of the image’s near disappearance. Sandra Lahire (1950-2001) was a central figure in the experimental feminist filmmaking that emerged in the UK in the 1980s. She made a number of films addressing the dangers of nuclear power.","popularity":0.0783,"poster_path":"/m9p4QG98BMyUiMPxyBTUl0n9yiC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terminals","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Earnshaw","original_name":"Frankie Earnshaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d6ab10e0a264fc2001547","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge Lahire","original_name":"Inge Lahire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d6ab7925141677f0011c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria McMahgn","original_name":"Maria McMahgn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d6abd92514166180014b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathy Morley","original_name":"Cathy Morley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d6ac20e0a264fc2001551","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Novaczeck","original_name":"Kate Novaczeck","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1d6ac70e0a264f950013dc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Lahire","original_name":"Sandra Lahire","popularity":0.0653,"profile_path":"/nHbLQ3Gy3jILGTsld6L4k4dKXa4.jpg","credit_id":"59a9d0e2c3a3685c5100137a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inge Lahire","original_name":"Inge Lahire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1d6ad70e0a264fa10014d6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giora Feidman","original_name":"Giora Feidman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1d6ae2925141669d001771","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8783970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m9p4QG98BMyUiMPxyBTUl0n9yiC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
