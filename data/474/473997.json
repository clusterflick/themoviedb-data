Men are heard in voice-over speaking a love-talk which is personal, though anonymous, or singular. Another voice-over reads parables, which present a context for the possibility of love or spirit in the world at large. The film ends optimistically: a smile slowly spreads on a man's face. Women addressing men in their own voices.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wvqBLJSBDz36tbzJ0Rx8aJip9OZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Present","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1815202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Sternberg","original_name":"Barbara Sternberg","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/9GzMVZrcMUHdr7PookJHUHpX03w.jpg","credit_id":"59ad708fc3a3682c22043d40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0247937","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvqBLJSBDz36tbzJ0Rx8aJip9OZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
