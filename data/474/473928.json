Over the past 15 years as a recording artist, Dianne Reeves has earned two Grammy nominations and endless critical praise - but it's in live performance that Reeves truly shines, when her gorgeous voice, her spontaneity and her intuition combine for very special musical evenings. Dianne Reeves is renowned for her wide-ranging choice of material, and the numbers on this evening's program include standards, compositions by artists as diverse as Mongo Santamaria and Joni Mitchell, and Reeves originals. In the artist's own words, music should have \"no boundaries\", and in Reeves' singing the strengths of jazz, R&B and gospel - and of Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean - come together in a glorious fusion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3lYiX8CvpDTAKx5HFKXSyPCEUIu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dianne Reeves: Live in Montreal","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3lYiX8CvpDTAKx5HFKXSyPCEUIu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
