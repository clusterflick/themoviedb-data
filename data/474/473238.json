Call Me is about a man who thinks a night of passion is in store, but when he gets home, what awaits him is far from passion. In Patterson Road, a group of teens ventures to a wooded area rumored to have a hidden cemetery. They should have been careful what they asked for because in this case, that's exactly what they got. Speaking Ill of the Dead has a basic theme that karma is a bitch. And Trip has Terra, a struggling alcoholic looking for anything to decrease her stress. In all of these tales, characters had a bad feeling, a gut instinct, about what they were doing, but they didn't listen and paid the ultimate price.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/obu28SfQHDGIxFWSle5vP6VCdJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Oak Film Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gut Instincts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1879526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Henderson","original_name":"Michelle Henderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a71e71c3a3683cf80040da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1879527,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shannon Casto","original_name":"Shannon Casto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a71e78c3a3683cf80040e5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1879528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ari Blum","original_name":"Ari Blum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a71e8192514157f60042dd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2570056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obu28SfQHDGIxFWSle5vP6VCdJh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
