That all of these wishes have become a reality is probably down to the immense stubbornness of this charismatic and equally hilarious matriarch who has a weakness for collecting crazy objects. When financial circumstances force the family to sell their castle, her adult children are left sifting through a lifetime of peculiarities in search of a few lost bones… Spanish actor and neo director Gustavo Salmerón paints a deliciously absurd family portrait that just happens to reveal a lot about Spain, Catholicism and the economic crisis.","popularity":0.1704,"poster_path":"/1IXufNFOPhRvOnng1f3ElkwxGCp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sueños Despiertos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lots of Kids, a Monkey and a Castle","video":false,"vote_average":7.189,"vote_count":45,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Muchos Hijos, Un Mono y Un Castillo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1879285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julita Salmerón","original_name":"Julita Salmerón","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59a69a9fc3a36827e900b9ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Salmerón","original_name":"Gustavo Salmerón","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/tsfXGt9uyUD3JNSMIRJN8YqsEmi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a84aedcc3a36862a7012416","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2575329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Montañez","original_name":"Beatriz Montañez","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/9sUeLZUOBU7SXGszEH2jaFEjSFb.jpg","credit_id":"62fad38dcb802800812901eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489877,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raúl de Torres","original_name":"Raúl de Torres","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fad383a313b8007cf48965","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Salmerón","original_name":"Gustavo Salmerón","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/tsfXGt9uyUD3JNSMIRJN8YqsEmi.jpg","credit_id":"62fad3798566d2007b72b26a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Salmerón","original_name":"Gustavo Salmerón","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/tsfXGt9uyUD3JNSMIRJN8YqsEmi.jpg","credit_id":"59a69aad92514112ef00bc24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7115920","wikidata_id":"Q51880327","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aFK4vzhhtz6P4N4yojKHM5DyzUB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1qRpmkygid0WwhO1a15gF3pO75G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.608,"height":538,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/7l0eSwCFSDM77RhGoDYR9enb7Lx.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":865}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/rBBsRmbht1S8hqHftzPIiidxXxA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1IXufNFOPhRvOnng1f3ElkwxGCp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/b1IXJyNDs91ueY2ZQDDlNSHHOni.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":842},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oZLEp1WesaoJ02pWKhDsKwdeHPE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"N-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2018 IFF Kino pavasaris","release_date":"2018-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"NPO 2","release_date":"2019-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lots of Kids, a Monkey and a Castle - Official Trailer","key":"e9UOfSCjHBo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-08-18T13:05:45.000Z","id":"5caeb8e50e0a2626c8c1c543"}]}}}
