He took what others might deem trash or obsolete and turned it into something contemplative. He opened Paradise Garden for the world to enjoy, a true testament that Art comes to life, when people are able to interact with it. Howard Finster showed the world that objects surrounding us can take on a new life, in a sometimes magical way, and communicate messages that can lead to transformation.","popularity":0.3462,"poster_path":"/wtfJYcbEWft7D7eOR3hHoxagdOU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Garden: Howard Finster's Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mills","original_name":"Mike Mills","popularity":0.2484,"profile_path":"/69f9zCc4Boh7DmOMTBAKdcfmC98.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59ab1b4cc3a3682c9c018151","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1099284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Ray","original_name":"Amy Ray","popularity":0.149,"profile_path":"/qcBJp2A4eYTmmZRl8RebjxXqdHt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59ab1b58925141072f019865","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Frantz","original_name":"Chris Frantz","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/qo9j6AeMCgwpGTOhSeV03Vhr5Gk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59ab1b62c3a3682c220182a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Finster","original_name":"Howard Finster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"59b2d477925141078a0a6d58","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ava Leigh Stewart","original_name":"Ava Leigh Stewart","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ab1b1f925141078a019c39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2380121","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1821,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wtfJYcbEWft7D7eOR3hHoxagdOU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":237681,"name":"outsider art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Savannah Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
