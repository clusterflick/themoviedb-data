Directors Rob Curry and Tim Plester have created a poetic response to the life-and-times of this totemic musical figure. Four years in the making, and co produced by Fifth Column Films and Burning Bridges, The Ballad of Shirley Collins is the fascinating first release from Fire Films - available to you exclusively through the Lush Player. A captivating study of heritage, posterity and the true ancestral melodies of the people, this heartwarming film revolves around Shirley’s tragic loss of her voice and struggle back to the limelight. And ultimately, it suggests that in these turbulent and increasingly untethered times, we may just need Shirley Collins and all she represents more than ever.","popularity":0.6218,"poster_path":"/jAM98Qsg52jwkRaYUnetldkjsjI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Shirley Collins","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Collins","original_name":"Shirley Collins","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a74bb430e0a266430028103","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1334639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Arterton","original_name":"Hannah Arterton","popularity":0.3131,"profile_path":"/505cYGyXmOX4RHZxXPsrQaVoOJL.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a74bc169251410594023f6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Lee","original_name":"Stewart Lee","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/6MKi736NjqDNMmJ2E9m9NZukEiN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bb4b92514105a6023dd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Amidon","original_name":"Sam Amidon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bb55c3a36859fc027ade","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. John Tully","original_name":"Dr. John Tully","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bb61c3a3685a0c0258cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Tibet","original_name":"David Tibet","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bb6d0e0a266433026dae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elle Osborne","original_name":"Elle Osborne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a74bb86c3a36859d3022e84","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Kearey","original_name":"Ian Kearey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bbad92514105a9023239","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ossian Brown","original_name":"Ossian Brown","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bbb5c3a36859d902372d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen Thrower","original_name":"Stephen Thrower","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":"/wwyC8F7SjPbVBhDbGnRzKxLyIlN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a74bbc40e0a266427026a64","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Plester","original_name":"Tim Plester","popularity":0.261,"profile_path":"/a66p9DDwRSQFRZcDn3sDLsGb8zu.jpg","credit_id":"59adc96c92514107af04a2ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Curry","original_name":"Rob Curry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59adc952925141079d048439","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4148022","wikidata_id":"Q44491866","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jAM98Qsg52jwkRaYUnetldkjsjI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":974,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x35t1FlIppNb0NoHB9EGVVSoZcV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Ballad of Shirley Collins US Theatrical Trailer","key":"G05D_gcIK2E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-22T07:44:22.000Z","id":"5d01abf20e0a2632c3c9afed"}]}}}
