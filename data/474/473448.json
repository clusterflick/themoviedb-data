Soueid shows us scenes of El Kurdi’s domestic world: eating, applying make-up, dancing in her bedroom, all while reflecting on her life and experiences. She expresses her desire to undergo gender reassignment surgery, and mourns the death of her lover, a Palestinian freedom fighter. She often alludes to the aggressions she faces outside of her home, and through her adept defiance in the face of some of Soueid’s more goading questions, we recognize the echoing of these aggressions in his role as interviewer.","popularity":0.4664,"poster_path":"/vuVcJ9p6ZGNPG7iTO4dGUXT58O7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Télé Liban","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Fouad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Cinema El-Fouad","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khaled El Kurdi","original_name":"Khaled El Kurdi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59a89c1e925141580801e9e5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Soueid","original_name":"Mohamed Soueid","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/7CcWnPr7Wf9nHOlvOwdfStbavbs.jpg","credit_id":"59a89cdf92514157a501e0ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l7vKhiFFAlGDrgCM7ZM8UjBFL7w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vuVcJ9p6ZGNPG7iTO4dGUXT58O7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aMqPLW2WxjpI7HF3xOjSNdZhPbO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":571,"name":"transsexuality"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
