The film is visual, perceptual; it was made in awe of the world that goes on with and without us and of our personal, human struggles. It is a film about life and death; a film of discrete units of the eternal and a film of living here and now. It was built up frame by frame-a film about power, played in insignificant terms, in the daily, barely noticed gestures, scenes, frames.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4HjhaUgbBiq8ANxw05Syg0X3XQI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through and Through","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1815202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Sternberg","original_name":"Barbara Sternberg","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/9GzMVZrcMUHdr7PookJHUHpX03w.jpg","credit_id":"59ad6d2092514107af0463b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0203985","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4HjhaUgbBiq8ANxw05Syg0X3XQI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
