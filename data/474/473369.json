Lee is a retired coal miner and revered banjo legend, a living link to the deep past of American music. Though now well into his eighties and hampered by age, Lee continues to perform and teach his distinctive 2-finger banjo style to a new generation eager to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition. Linefork offers an immersive view of Lee and Opal's daily rituals and inherent resilience while documenting the raw yet delicate music of a singular musician, linked to the past yet immediately present.","popularity":0.3014,"poster_path":"/1elC3HWamYEu4YDUSbQvCS94a4m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Linefork","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Sexton","original_name":"Lee Sexton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5aca3dfdc3a36834d70651e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Opal Sexton","original_name":"Opal Sexton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5aca3e0ec3a36834d0059f3e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Silva","original_name":"Jeff Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca3dc70e0a264967061f52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vic Rawlings","original_name":"Vic Rawlings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aca3db492514162ab05d16d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5553782","wikidata_id":"Q27043389","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1elC3HWamYEu4YDUSbQvCS94a4m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":3291,"name":"kentucky"},{"id":243486,"name":"bango"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema","release_date":"2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Visions du RÃ©el Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
