But it is haunted by memories of a massacre: terrorists opened fire and killed six innocents while they watched the match in a small village pub in Northern Ireland. Remarkably, no one was ever charged for the crime. For more than twenty years the victims' families have searched for answers. Now, at last, they may have found them. But what they learn turns a murder mystery into bigger inquiry relevant for us all: what happens when governments cover up the truth?","popularity":0.991,"poster_path":"/k8HLgfeyGzGZeIOGNMUUs5rm3LY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80995,"logo_path":"/awknjEFU2v2qRKAOe1MZkaMDYN2.png","name":"Fine Point Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2740,"logo_path":"/gSiDWkmEOyOn9MsaCgnjd8Mohmx.png","name":"Jigsaw Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Brutal Atrocity.
