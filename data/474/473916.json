Artist and Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma, Arrival) finds inspiration in Pittsburgh’s Hill District neighborhood, a site of the early 20th-century Great Migration. During this time, millions of African Americans moved from the rural southern United States to cities in the north and west. The Hill District saw a flourishing of culture during these years and was a site of artistic development for luminaries such as August Wilson, Charles “Teenie” Harris, Errol Garner, and many others. REkOGNIZE takes its visual cues from the Pittsburgh landscape, especially the city’s tunnels, which serve not only as literal entry points into the city, but also as metaphors for this movement of people and culture.","popularity":0.4279,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"REkOGNIZE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046612,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bradford Young","original_name":"Bradford Young","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/shGkUnVemFAOVJuXQDk58CqCgsz.jpg","credit_id":"59adff74925141072304af29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":158697,"name":"installation"},{"id":193594,"name":"pittsburgh, pennsylvania"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
