After The Dark Side of the Moon became a global smash, the band concentrated on the creative freedom of live performance, leaving the world of TV behind, but now, after painstaking research, tapes of those early historic appearances have been tracked down and compiled into a fascinating hour of early Pink Floyd. With front man Syd Barrett, they perform Astronomy Domine and Jugband Blues, and after Syd's departure, Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason can be seen playing a full range of their eclectic material, from out and out pop in It Would Be So Nice, through instrumental improvisations, collaboration with choir and orchestra on Atom Heart Mother and enduring rock material like Wot's...Uh The Deal.","popularity":0.348,"poster_path":"/gMD3MV1MMujIvogBhF5UuahUh42.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Floyd Beginnings 1967-1972","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gMD3MV1MMujIvogBhF5UuahUh42.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233744,"name":"classic rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC 4","release_date":"2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
