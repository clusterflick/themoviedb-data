The traditional tone of the cinematic impressions takes us back into the past (evocations of Boyleâ€™s era, projection using damaged film stock) and the images have something of a cathartic quality about them. The title of this dream-like, mood- -inducing film, a tribute of sorts to the Irish thinker, was inspired by a Jorie Graham poem and underlines the nature of the 14-year process during which the film came together.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/q2uzC4E9W1QxRoBdrMv7dg7oc8j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Pain and Rhyme and Arabesques of Foraging","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1076451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gatten","original_name":"David Gatten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sALyIeLWitHtT21x3ql47oYar7r.jpg","credit_id":"59ac0b3ec3a3682c48029c86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q2uzC4E9W1QxRoBdrMv7dg7oc8j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ndKGjtinwrlqOfoXnvikv9hUiOO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (IFFR)","release_date":"2013-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: David Gatten's information.","release_date":"2012-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
