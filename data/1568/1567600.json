The crumbling building became a recreated “country”, with a farm, gardens, terraces and rooms where old VHS tapes revive memories of a lost paradise. Through Tamuna, Irma, and others, the film explores exile, trauma, and shared resilience, showing that nothing stays the same inside Kartli.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gPkxkpZ1RBm43Wx4Yp2DvH3HbXJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154804,"logo_path":"/AbIG9skS70ySK5LmBbLjl8djyUM.png","name":"Sakdoc
