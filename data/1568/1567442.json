His career is stalling, he’s on the brink of a divorce, and he’s feeling guilty about being an absent father to his young son. During a freak rainstorm, he has a fleeting and powerful connection with the captivating Inma, and these two strangers in a strange land are consumed by mutual attraction. But this isn’t a love story. These are adults with baggage, unable to walk away from their pasts. Sam also develops a bond with charismatic local guide Abdullah, whose unlikely friendship offers him the chance to further explore his emotions. Sam’s journey is both poignant and comedic; it may not provide him with easy answers, but it does offer him a chance to start anew.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":191442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Morning Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Alone Together","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Callum Turner","original_name":"Callum Turner","popularity":3.7558,"profile_path":"/vkZ35K9ge6rWNrGyRdRtS4ONITv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"68fa2e3b27a2c714d4e2d298","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adria Arjona","original_name":"Adria Arjona","popularity":4.0314,"profile_path":"/1pRUjjrhnn1EzFz5dxbFAxcSCBC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Inma","credit_id":"68fa2e4ad76b8195e5128078","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1739403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amir El-Masry","original_name":"Amir El-Masry","popularity":0.5805,"profile_path":"/naHrnri1hs5mMcvydNIORuM2nQn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Abdullah","credit_id":"68fa2e56836df033d612800d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Sharrock","original_name":"Ben Sharrock","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/iJwzxMYURXOhtS8zKxIIljDWOjQ.jpg","credit_id":"68fa2e68d3e4cb966012805c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Sharrock","original_name":"Ben Sharrock","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/iJwzxMYURXOhtS8zKxIIljDWOjQ.jpg","credit_id":"68fa2e6d4db2679a996b1e3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florian Zeller","original_name":"Florian Zeller","popularity":0.4846,"profile_path":"/e2koSVDhNPlENZ7zRZq2eyC3A7y.jpg","credit_id":"68fa2e7c789bee79cfe2d2e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4654254,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Federica Sainte-Rose","original_name":"Federica Sainte-Rose","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/93X59gL7dJhvFBmcI7kGu9ZHUGq.jpg","credit_id":"68fa2e87c4f2b4c471417aeb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
