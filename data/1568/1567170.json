Born in 1895, Workman provided for a family of thirteen by working in the coal mines of West Virginia, and he reminisces about his experience with union organizing in the 1920s and 30s with anecdotes that match many of the experiences of miners of later years, too. To Fit My Own Category is an extended visit at his home as Workman and his family prepare meals, build an addition to the house, dig for yellow root, swap jokes with the neighbors, and enjoy each otherâ€™s company.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Appalshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nimrod Workman: To Fit My Own Category","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nimrod Workman","original_name":"Nimrod Workman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68f9619a9a659037f06b1b3e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Faulkner","original_name":"Scott Faulkner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f961b4fc02b14593580bcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Slone","original_name":"Anthony Slone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f961fb4435184fc5e2cf73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":191738,"name":"coal mines"},{"id":234970,"name":"appalachian mountains"},{"id":360739,"name":"appalachian ballads"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"16mm Film","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nimrod Workman:  To Fit My Own Category","key":"Yc4iTqWr5Lc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-04-02T13:19:55.000Z","id":"68f962cb4db2679a996b1acd"}]}}}
