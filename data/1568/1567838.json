Thralldom, a tyrannical regime has conquered a magical and music-loving land called Songville. Danny, Mish, and Hanan, now exiles, rise from captives to high-ranking overseers under the Iron Masterâ€™s rule. They faithfully serve their master while secretly pledging allegiance to the true High King and the ways of Songville. However, as tensions rise and the cost of resistance grows, they must decide whether to risk their lives for the sake of faith and what they truly loveâ€” or remain silent in the face of tyranny. Are they willing to put their lives on the line for it?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ysKO9UyTWNmiLG4PiY4svPx5P0o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narrow Way
