Meanwhile, wealthy Ethel Lewis is separated from her husband, Robert, because she refuses to have children. On Ethel's behalf, a lawyer offers Alice $50,000 in exchange for the adoption of her youngest child, Louise. After Alice reluctantly accepts, Ethel presents the child to Robert as their own. Alice visits the Lewis home frequently, rekindling Robert's long-dormant romantic feelings for her. John is consumed with jealousy and attempts to shoot Robert, but accidentally hits Louise. Alice then awakens to find that it was a horrible dream. She refuses the lawyer's offer just as her Aunt Martha enters with apologies and Christmas presents.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Empty Cradle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
