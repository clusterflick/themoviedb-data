A clash of civilizations where two worldviews collide. Quebec, buoyed by the momentum of the Quiet Revolution, takes control of its destiny. Meanwhile, in the North, young Inuit and Cree rise up for the first time to protect what is most precious to them: their land and their culture. At the heart of the conflict is the James Bay construction site, the largest of its kind in North America.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"James Bay 1975","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melanie Lameboy","original_name":"Melanie Lameboy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa3a3dae3b2cec4a6b1dc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1886535,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Myriam Berthelet","original_name":"Myriam Berthelet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa3a52c2a6c402cc85329e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415417,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mathieu Fournier","original_name":"Mathieu Fournier","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa3ab84f7c1b156b128129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
