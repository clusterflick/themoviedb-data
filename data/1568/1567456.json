The director films these encounters over ten years. He evokes memories, dialogues with life, peeks into the unfathomable in himself and in each character. Trying to hold time, MISSISSIPIS is a manifesto on the vital importance of the encounter – with others, but also of each person with themselves.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/1xp0FpfSOg6cadz7wJUbDZTnvzi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mississipis","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"António-Pedro","original_name":"António-Pedro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa32ada1507c0464f29d59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30005876","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":"PT","iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/1xp0FpfSOg6cadz7wJUbDZTnvzi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1357}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
