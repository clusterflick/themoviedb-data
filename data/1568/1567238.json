During the revolutionary war, this town was headquarters for General Washington, and the prison from that time has now become a restaurant and is a famous spot for tourists. The town has many old homes and old families. To this town come three young men: Bernard Stein, Christopher Wren, and Peter Ferguson. By chance, at the same time they each meet a woman and become engaged. To celebrate the end of their bachelorhood, they arrange to take a short boat trip south. Just as the boat is leaving, they each receive a letter from the same mysterious sender.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lYWLIlvyUNbQOXxmvw0R36z0Pbb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hopscotch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4076768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuki You","original_name":"Tatsuki You","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/siwYAvstMloEUTDfBYxoEnrBfi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bernard Stein","credit_id":"68f98c8a7e41e4906cf29b1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2382973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"So Kazuho","original_name":"壮一帆","popularity":1.391,"profile_path":"/7YrglI2DBpzDKDi4L0foDs6alxN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Christopher Wren","credit_id":"68f98c91836df033d6127e41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1517393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kei Otozuki","original_name":"音月桂","popularity":0.7655,"profile_path":"/vHPKzoxVmYIQlfQGhNvwPUyg7RT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Peter Ferguson","credit_id":"68f98c9a74047496536b1bdd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1489700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Shirahane","original_name":"白羽ゆり","popularity":0.2958,"profile_path":"/5zQct16j7qZPnD8E2DPUAwc70aG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Barbara Maccuigan","credit_id":"68f98ca3186a49fba26b1c8b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3073408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaname Ouki","original_name":"凰稀かなめ","popularity":0.9293,"profile_path":"/rpIYAotzTYEwVaMWnxAxPcx71jA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ben Stoppard","credit_id":"68f98cb76fb49fac22536504","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3135119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozuki Tooma","original_name":"Ozuki Tooma","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/jrvXQt2djLGMiVlG9O5jZS6Rwqi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ralph Scott","credit_id":"68f98cbfe0e2387e58f29b21","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4994963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oota Tetsunori","original_name":"Oota Tetsunori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f98cd5c3b30111de6b1b5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4994963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oota Tetsunori","original_name":"Oota Tetsunori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f98cdad3d62235dc6b1b34","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lYWLIlvyUNbQOXxmvw0R36z0Pbb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
