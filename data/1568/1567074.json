Between pain and self-discovery, he dies and is reborn to realize that the true bail for freedom is confidence — in himself, his voice, and his purpose.  Blending six songs and seven poems into a cinematic narrative, Livre com Fiança is a visual album about self-esteem, faith, and liberation.  Written, directed, and produced by Spartakus, with music videos by Ricardo Souza, Marco Antonio Ferreira, and Breno Shinn, the film reflects on how the pursuit of success and popularity can imprison the soul — and how self-love and respect for diversity can become the path to true freedom.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6J5Wdi7qTKk2rhgUkOzhb2KLu3i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haus of Spartta","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a visual journey of self-love and liberation","title":"Free on Bail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spartakus Santiago","original_name":"Spartakus Santiago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Cartomante / Omolu / Exu / Oxossi / Ogum / Oxalá","credit_id":"68f93e511691f3eedf9d27c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5416206,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colibri","original_name":"Colibri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Colibri","credit_id":"68f93e5d00ce297fd0ea1e1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Brito","original_name":"Camilla Brito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Oxum","credit_id":"68f93e6b28bd644df1cac7ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5766274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria de Lourdes Borges F","original_name":"Maria de Lourdes Borges F","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Iemanjá","credit_id":"68f93e80aefa452318cac75f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spartakus Santiago","original_name":"Spartakus Santiago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f93e9ad543e4ac89b90af8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38754022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"spartakus","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2962,"iso_3166_1":"BR","iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/6J5Wdi7qTKk2rhgUkOzhb2KLu3i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":173431,"name":"tarot"},{"id":248714,"name":"music film"},{"id":253854,"name":"yoruba"},{"id":256343,"name":"visual album"},{"id":297969,"name":"diversity"},{"id":360724,"name":"orisha"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Spartakus - LIVRE COM FIANÇA (Trailer Oficial)","key":"9OE2zL8Oozs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-10-13T17:26:51.000Z","id":"68f93d6f68f7afa635b909f9"}]}}}
