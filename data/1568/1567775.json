The two men had gone out to post signs protesting the return of Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, who had been exiled following the October 14, 1973 uprising. Thanom’s return in 1976 sparked widespread public outrage, and Wichai and Chumphon were among those who opposed it. Shortly afterward, both were found hanged in public, their bodies displayed for passersby to see. However, no proper investigation was carried out to identify or prosecute those responsible. Their bodies were quickly buried without autopsy, leaving the case shrouded in mystery and injustice.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pvguISwmE0GdU0lg8RbHUUSAktl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278178,"logo_path":null,"name":"บันทึก 6 ตุลา","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2017-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Two Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5021799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teerawat Rujenatham","original_name":"Teerawat Rujenatham","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fab551876e2e3033e2d553","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4152781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patporn Phootong","original_name":"Patporn Phootong","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fab57c780e19abbb8535d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"TH","iso_639_1":"th","file_path":"/pvguISwmE0GdU0lg8RbHUUSAktl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
