The price she has paid for speaking the truth about China's persecution of the Uyghurs in East Turkestan (Xinjiang) is immense. But she cannot remain silent. As a woman of Uzbek heritage who grew up in the Uyghur community, she has seen with her own eyes the methods used by the Chinese state to extirpate the Uyghur population. Her recollections of dehumanizing internment camps are interwoven with monotonous state propaganda describing \"training centers\" where extremist ideas are \"eradicated.\" State control extends into the private realm too, through a program obligating families to host party members at home.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Uighur","iso_639_1":"ug","name":""}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Eyes of the Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"ماشىنىنىڭ كۆزى","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daya Cahen","original_name":"Daya Cahen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa98ff92722a38d8467262","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daya Cahen","original_name":"Daya Cahen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa991438b7014358417dcb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daya Cahen","original_name":"Daya Cahen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa991b6416fc72bc536a53","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daya Cahen","original_name":"Daya Cahen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa9921b615394b1a4672db","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daya Cahen","original_name":"Daya Cahen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa992bb615394b1a4672de","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587608,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Dijkstal","original_name":"Hugo Dijkstal","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fa99365795159e7be2d609","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1073,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/QMYAXQe1LJBEdyI9k0Q70IG8Nn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1908}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
