What we eat, what we read, who we elect; every day we make choices that determine how we want to live.\r But what if these choices are just an illusion?\r In an era where regulations and red tape rule every industry, where lobby groups and big businesses wield more influence than ever before, our daily choices have become increasingly limited. And with all our options so deliberately handpicked, are we really making a choice at all?\r Freedom From Choice examines the current state of life and personal choice today. Experts from many different fields offer a frank and startling look at the hidden limitations in our daily lives. Focusing on key areas such as food, medicine, finance, and media, Freedom From Choice provides viewers with a glimpse at the myriad of ways their lives are being dictated and tells us who stands to gain.","popularity":0.5481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom of Choice: How the Government Controls What You Consume","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Delmastro","original_name":"Tim Delmastro","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c220ed8eda87006d7518a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120529,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoshi Kan","original_name":"Yoshi Kan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c222772c6b7b00418620b5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Delmastro","original_name":"Tim Delmastro","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c220c5960cde00298702b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael R Limotta","original_name":"Michael R Limotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c221ca39a45d0057dc21f8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Delmastro","original_name":"Tim Delmastro","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c221071c6aa70059528dec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luis Goyzueta","original_name":"Luis Goyzueta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c222a205a53300408416ef","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Moto Kan","original_name":"Moto Kan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2228739a45d0077658aba","department":"Production","job":"Executive Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":417,"name":"corruption"},{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":6135,"name":"pharmaceutical industry"},{"id":11738,"name":"evil corporation"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":184110,"name":"government regulation"},{"id":210449,"name":"libertarian"},{"id":219605,"name":"lobbyist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
