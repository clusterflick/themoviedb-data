The plot is set in a single space... a police interrogation room for suspects. It has only three characters; the suspect, who is an architect, and an idealist influenced by radical ideas. The other two characters are policemen, who try to coax from him the motive behind the death (murder?) of his three year old child. Even in a remastered DVD, the beta production values of a television production will be evident. But at barely a few minutes over an hour, it packs a brisk, at times rushed, but an interesting narrative. Makes one wonder, what other gems must the TV vaults in France (and UK, and Germany, and Italy) conceal?","popularity":0.2528,"poster_path":"/dJ44lUDor2xvAJuB6GQXkO24Tbh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24119,"logo_path":"/iNcPopycyTGDgWy6dDl5cnlfS3n.png","name":"Radio-Télévision Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le dossier Chelsea Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Vaneck","original_name":"Pierre Vaneck","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/sX7AO0tJAnscSD7wEzq98uLM539.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"George Steward","credit_id":"60c079ddd7fbda006f96b721","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Géret","original_name":"Georges Géret","popularity":0.2215,"profile_path":"/b8cIQk0sxwnF4snfMuG1S8lnH7V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The inspector","credit_id":"60c07a16dcb6a30058210c4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Tréjan","original_name":"Guy Tréjan","popularity":0.1791,"profile_path":"/4RdQqzdKhqQ04gvMVFi7UxoiQqi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The chief inspector","credit_id":"60c07a47f5c82400405cfa88","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Bluwal","original_name":"Marcel Bluwal","popularity":0.284,"profile_path":"/ydn0RtiLD7WSmWvQN9b9o6W7PXC.jpg","credit_id":"60c07add960cde006d93019f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119231,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Weideli","original_name":"Walter Weideli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c07b0eeb79c200579fd86e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0356551","wikidata_id":"Q19631672","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kg5H8RPF0N1GfJzgZyzOd7ih4mC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b737690eRmKfUFzbgj1kPYzY1is.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2178,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dJ44lUDor2xvAJuB6GQXkO24Tbh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1452}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RTF Télévision","release_date":"1962-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
