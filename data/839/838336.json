Tikinagan is the Ojiubway word for cradleboard... the indigenous device in which babies are carried on a parent's back. Tikinagan is also the name of a revolutionary Native child-care agency operating out of Sioux Lookout, Ontario. Tikinagan workers know that the welfare of the children in their remote northwestern Ontario communities is in peril and needs special help. They still encounter the residue of bitterness and distrust left after years of conflict with provincial child welfare agencies. They have let their story be told in a film that is honest and uncompromising.
