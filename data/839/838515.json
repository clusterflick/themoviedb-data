They share one point in common: they are all facing a pivotal moment in their lives. Their real journey is internal, and it is you who will embark on it, taking their place to help them make a crucial decision. Discover the inner world of each of them: a Lady tries to make sense of her fading memories, the Kid struggles with his guilt about his parents’ separation, a woman (Her) questions her motherhood and a man (Him) must overcome his shyness. Enter the thoughts of one character at a time, to hear their inner voice, see their memories and live their emotions. The user can change the course of the story with their gaze, voice, or gestures.
