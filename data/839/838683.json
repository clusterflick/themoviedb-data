In 1992, Mark and director Martin Bell returned to India to film many of the same performers. The resulting short, THE AMAZING PLASTIC LADY (1995), focuses on Pinky, a ten-year-old acrobat who, like the children in STREETWISE, lives on society’s margins. The film also continued Bell’s work with editor Nancy Baker.","popularity":0.1244,"poster_path":"/oOjPxNbDEHHsaz6Wg8VZVQhdBkv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amazing Plastic Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mary Ellen Mark","original_name":"Mary Ellen Mark","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/8xLyvZX5RpUwfCWI4OsvQAexVOr.jpg","credit_id":"60c127caaf6e940042dc3b36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Bell","original_name":"Martin Bell","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/iDcZNf1opK4l8FReBPEFCAGvIEH.jpg","credit_id":"60c1270bd34eb30058720ec4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Bell","original_name":"Martin Bell","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/iDcZNf1opK4l8FReBPEFCAGvIEH.jpg","credit_id":"60c127d38390180057d5db3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51842,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nancy Baker","original_name":"Nancy Baker","popularity":0.1611,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c127eef18ce7006dc4fdf4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15035800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oOjPxNbDEHHsaz6Wg8VZVQhdBkv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oCznEIlIhyCQkQZFPY5dOcbpmja.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1143}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
