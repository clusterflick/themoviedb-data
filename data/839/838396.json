Her children are learning about their past and, in particular, the Treaty land Entitlement settlement that their First Nation has just completed. This is a story that shows the path that previous generations have foretold and how they laid the foundations for the present generation. We also examine the conflict that land claims have created and how they can be solved. Jack's friend Jeff, a non-Native, is caught between the two groups and must learn what the land claim is and how it can be solved everyone's best interests.  This is a story that is being repeated as First Nations Continue to develop and take their place within Canada.
