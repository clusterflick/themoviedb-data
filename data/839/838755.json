All they wanted was to be free. From Beirut to Montreal, Quebec City or Vancouver, this ensemble documentary follows the journeys of four people who are determined to change their future. From the terrifying realities they had to flee to the heartbreaking sacrifices they were forced to make, Renaître is a vibrant and luminous tribute to their quiet strength.","popularity":0.1215,"poster_path":"/gm2dAfJNHsr0V3kncULRXMCTy5t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71958,"logo_path":null,"name":"AIDIA","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Renaître","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Renaître - Immigration LGBTQ+au Canada","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Péloquin","original_name":"François Péloquin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c1660ceb79c200781bc124","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Péloquin","original_name":"François Péloquin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c16585f18ce7006dc560cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Péloquin","original_name":"François Péloquin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c16611f18ce7006dc56226","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119966,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jose Enrique Hernandez Careaga","original_name":"Jose Enrique Hernandez Careaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c166a6960cde0040f35d85","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emanuele Setticasi","original_name":"Emanuele Setticasi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c166025ab81a003f8b3d68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2879574,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Sébastien Ouellet","original_name":"Jean-Sébastien Ouellet","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/48oCWrAx1TiT8ZHVylLPOMv5fpE.jpg","credit_id":"60c166b8d34eb30058726fb7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7BHM3pdmf1HFvMIe9N8YNIQsYI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gm2dAfJNHsr0V3kncULRXMCTy5t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RVQC","release_date":"2021-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
