Simple witness of the century, she lived through Turkish domination and successive occupations linked to different wars. Most of her family stays elsewhere, in Greece or abroad (USA, Canada, Germany, Bulgaria); her shattered family world is representative of the Greek diaspora. The film is exclusively devoted to her life story, told to a young Epirot friend, Eleni Pangratiou-Alexakis, and to her daughter, Evguenia, both of whom have settled in the States. The result is a rich, yet austere film where nothing distracts the viewer from the dialogue and the face of the storyteller. It also constitutes an ordinary yet important testimony on this long and painful page of Greek history (1900-1983).","popularity":0.0918,"poster_path":"/kwsEec3mzkBbNUcawnDRPzM3W36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""},{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hard Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalliopi Kalogero","original_name":"Kalliopi Kalogero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60bf7a4f0bc5290029e95962","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleni Pangratiou-Alexakis","original_name":"Eleni Pangratiou-Alexakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60bf7b968a88b20077c4168e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenia Kosmas","original_name":"Eugenia Kosmas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60bf84480bc5290029e97acf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118404,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Graham Johnston","original_name":"Graham Johnston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf7b6c072166006f7a3d59","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118404,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Graham Johnston","original_name":"Graham Johnston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf7b5196e30b007909f66b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2573260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colette Piault","original_name":"Colette Piault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf7a358a88b2003feef270","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118490,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Electra Venaki","original_name":"Electra Venaki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf892d960cde002983dc42","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georges Nivoix","original_name":"Georges Nivoix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf88bd96e30b0040a6dc39","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3118492,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ariane Lewis-Gastambide","original_name":"Ariane Lewis-Gastambide","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bf895713a3880041ac55a5","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":841,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwsEec3mzkBbNUcawnDRPzM3W36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
