Some experienced the illness itself, while others faced the stress of work on the front line. Each Saturday, the residents came together to sing with each other from their communal balconies and walkways, and these songs permeate throughout the film. Increasingly frustrated by the government, residents experienced an emotional rollercoaster that is reflected in a film wherein the personal and political interweave, to create an intimate and moving portrait of a unique community during an extraordinary time.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs for the River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Ginsborg","original_name":"Charlotte Ginsborg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c0f0ce1c6aa7005950f905","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2017404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Astrid Edwards","original_name":"Astrid Edwards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c244bb39a45d0029c10f7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Ginsborg","original_name":"Charlotte Ginsborg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c244c35f4b73005a176a5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14871238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Songs for the River Trailer","key":"iGdJNkJz9w8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-04T16:53:42.000Z","id":"60cbd092c8a5ac00403f681b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Songs For The River - Trailer","key":"558944361","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-04T09:52:40.000Z","id":"60cbd09b42d8a50056dba7f1"}]}}}
