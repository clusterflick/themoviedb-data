But rather than a simple documentation of these journeys, this long-form structural film utilises Wong’s conceptual explorations to create a stunning, sensual work of pure cinema that continually upends our perceptual expectations.  On the soundtrack, we hear the continual lapping of ocean waves. A student of the legendary Sōtō Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, Al Wong here creates a film which perfectly symbolises the endless cycles discussed in Zen Buddhist philosophy. A monumental, largely-unseen masterwork 1970s avant-garde film, restored in 16mm by the Pacific Film Archive.","popularity":0.0532,"poster_path":"/AbaMTqHJBba6EHc3ldRAAO79FYg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twin Peaks","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3121826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Wong","original_name":"Al Wong","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60c3d9565b370d0028f09d01","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Wong","original_name":"Al Wong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/13VLeZoPgmRWoMLQHISubwA8LNS.jpg","credit_id":"60c6e41ed132d60059b72745","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15258268","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1076,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AbaMTqHJBba6EHc3ldRAAO79FYg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
