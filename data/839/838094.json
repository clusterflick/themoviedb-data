His relationship with Katharina is over. Or is it? The couple meet one last time. One evening, one night, one morning. He reproaches her, she blocks him. Ever new attempts, loops of desperation and anger, speechlessness. Ben wants to reinvent the relationship, Katharina wants to reinvent herself, as in her self-made videos which she shares on TikTok. «I loved you,» she says, «I thought you couldn’t feel it — I felt it anyway».","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Loved You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1966858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa Hannah Ziegler","original_name":"Rosa Hannah Ziegler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60befc50a44d090059320d84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
