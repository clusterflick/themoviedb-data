In Israel, we go from the venerable ramparts of Jerusalem to the vibrant modern skyline of Tel Aviv. In Palestine, we harvest olives near Hebron, visit a home in Bethlehem, and pop into a university in Ramallah. We also learn about security walls, disputed settlements, and the persistent challenges facing the region.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rick Steves' The Holy Land: Israelis and Palestinians Today","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Steves","original_name":"Rick Steves","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/aXwkjdAhP97LhWv10l1Sc32ZhXV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60c1ae43eb79c20029fafba5","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rick Steves' The Holy Land: Israelis and Palestinians Today","key":"wg1unr6eNpQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-11-07T23:08:32.000Z","id":"60e221eedb154f005e48eed9"}]}}}
