As the sun sets on the banks of the River Severn, on the outskirts of an impoverished city in the UK, a group of men race to catch a vanishing creature, the elusive elver (baby eel), supposedly worth more than its weight in gold. Over the course of a single night, the film surveys the mysterious world of the Elvermen: fathers, sons, brothers and friends addicted to the gamble of the stake-out, and the promise that it offers. Phone calls of frustration and joy echo down a river lit by head torches. The Elvermen shows how a rite of passage has changed into a fight for values: for tradition, for community, and for a connection to nature in an environment of impending change.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2dabTDgsY2zXL9JJvzfSBX9DfXh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elvermen","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isla Badenoch","original_name":"Isla Badenoch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8dbdfa1c59d005df5198b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2520454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Binks","original_name":"Joe Binks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612f068cfbe36f009222144e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2dabTDgsY2zXL9JJvzfSBX9DfXh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
