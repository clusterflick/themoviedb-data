Unusual events loom over the streets of Milan, capable of arousing wonder and undermining feelings in the inhabitants, no longer accostumed to real things. What appears to be the organization of another great festival, awaited and desired, or the preparation to make sure art reaches the public, is in reality a caravan committed to keeping alive a resistance to homologation. Among the narrow urban spaces, the PICs act in silence to change the perception of everyday life. Unforeseen feelings, unseen possibilities, and accidents along the way prove the real intentions and purposes of the protagonists in this story.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/bDBsMFrf2xa10wWtrzTnLTWMY51.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnia
