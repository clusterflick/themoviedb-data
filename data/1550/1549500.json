Matching instruments to their animal counterparts in Prokofiev's timeless classic, Peter and the Wolf exploring witty vignettes and a dazzling fugue in Benjamin Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra and magical tales of love and fantasy in Borodin's Polovstian Dances from Prince Igor. Margolyes is joined by the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra with Principal Conductor Nicholas Carter in a captivating program filmed live in concert at the 2017 Adelaide Festival - a sellout performance season that was a crowd-pleaser for young and old.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":79082,"logo_path":"/4lgerFJSRYtnKk2Kzl359z02cGs.png","name":"Foxtel","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter and the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Margolyes","original_name":"Miriam Margolyes","popularity":0.7244,"profile_path":"/vsnCGCp0nhJTag56HP8XFhXnZo9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68cef2c11890269e05ac7c1a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547204,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lillian Yau","original_name":"Lillian Yau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef2d5e99679837c7a4289","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Edwards","original_name":"Naomi Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef2f01fe1eea1cecebf2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701022,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ira Heyder","original_name":"Ira Heyder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef30ce2401a23cafe8f83","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4078061,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Toby Parkinson","original_name":"Thomas Toby Parkinson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef325b722df240dfe8f50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fraser Stark","original_name":"Fraser Stark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef33cabed0313be97d343","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Walsh","original_name":"Brian Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef34e5bd01524f4fe9065","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701027,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ben Doudney","original_name":"Ben Doudney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef3805bd01524f4fe9070","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362439,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Brookes","original_name":"James Brookes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef3af02048cfe22ac7ce3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701031,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julian Dyson","original_name":"Julian Dyson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef40c7024f6882b74942f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701033,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicholas Carter","original_name":"Nicholas Carter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cef45aafb194b888ac7e02","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15458060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"An excerpt from Peter and the Wolf - Miriam Margolyes, with Adelaide Symphony Orchestra","key":"5PLZuXGcoko","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-10-10T00:50:26.000Z","id":"68cef5345bd01524f4fe907d"}]}}}
