This mockumentary follows Aug's increasingly obsessive quest to understand the city's complicated relationship with its feathered residents. Through interviews with frustrated locals, dubious wildlife experts, and even a corvid cult leader, The Crows explores the absurd lengths people will go to solve an unsolvable problem.  Part nature documentary, part social satire, The Crows asks the important questions: Can humans and crows coexist? And more importantly, who's really the problem here?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wD5XoSFAVmtQZmCdccMg13fz56P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sc√≥pohile Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How much poop can one town handle?","title":"The Crows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Aug","original_name":"Tyler Aug","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68cf080d82ce345bb37a41e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Allen","original_name":"Chad Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Art Critic","credit_id":"68cf083a14789c92b3d41420","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Dunn-Walker","original_name":"Sophia Dunn-Walker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cult Leader","credit_id":"68cf084adb4c421484d4131f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5701153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.L.
