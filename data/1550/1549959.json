One of the many films immortalising the Marshal's funeral celebrations in Vilnius is the following report by Stanisław Urbanowicz. The film shows picturesque views of the city, places particularly associated with the figure of Piłsudski, and the funeral procession carrying the urn containing the Marshal's heart to the Ross Cemetery. Unfortunately, the only surviving copy is incomplete: it lacks an ending. The ending was partially reconstructed thanks to excerpts from the working material, without a soundtrack.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vilnius, City of Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635885,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanisław Urbanowicz","original_name":"Stanisław Urbanowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d035385e2bcb5439749969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
