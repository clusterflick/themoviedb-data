The film's textured imagery merges the vibrant defiance of the parade with the imposing presence of police lines, their shadows cast across the glitter-strewn streets.  Scenes of dancers and banners dissolve into one another, overlapping with sharp flashes of riot gear, creating a haunting interplay between celebration and surveillance. The camera lingers on fleeting moments while the weight of unseen power hovers, ever present.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"in the streets of June","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hogan Seidel","original_name":"Hogan Seidel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cff316ae30a3e9f6cd76bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
