The most interesting conception of the Revolutionary Etude had elements of abstract interplay of shapes and lights interspersed with takes of explosions, shouting faces distorted with a grimace, planes, and flames burning down symbolic icons of Polishness. Color Studies of Chopin was a propaganda film to lift the spirits and hearts of Poles in exile and at the same time to win over other nations’ sympathy for the Polish cause. To this end Cękalski roped in Olin Downes, a popular radio presenter and music critic, who overdubbed the beginning with a preface.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1944-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Studies of Chopin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugeniusz Cekalski","original_name":"Eugeniusz Cekalski","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/8bsd1Bbre45CpGxeZYDc7Pl3L0G.jpg","credit_id":"68d02a6f15945877f2fe9413","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
