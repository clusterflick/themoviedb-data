Since the birth of her child, she has felt abandoned and invisible, leading her into depression. Her family? Overwhelmed and absent. Her friends from earlier days? Long gone.  Noam’s father, Paulo, occasionally shows up, but he is usually drunk or accompanied by a new girlfriend. Like today. This time, her name is Sarah – chic, loud, and with a subtle knack for reminding Mala how little remains of her old life.  But something about today is different from all the other difficult days. Mala is approached on the street by a young man named Casper, who lives in the neighbourhood. And for a brief moment, she feels seen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iZPMZUud7GZlgHadarouZ0SRw7g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NOAM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noam Goursaud","original_name":"Noam Goursaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Noam","credit_id":"68cd8335f432052a837a3a57","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosima Henman","original_name":"Cosima Henman","popularity":0.6444,"profile_path":"/3idZ7c2uNN6wiqdA8QuLUq6oK4k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mala","credit_id":"68cd8346b6c8bf2bb6ceb879","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Goursaud","original_name":"Jeanne Goursaud","popularity":1.8221,"profile_path":"/d8z3LEQGHCiZIRmMQD55Geq0iqM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"68cd837833e4eab140ac7609","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Wollin","original_name":"Paul Wollin","popularity":0.4296,"profile_path":"/flpMDnrxJDjYtiwhvTT4fJGcpFh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Paulo","credit_id":"68cd83867e792b4cb07a3a67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Gries","original_name":"Konstantin Gries","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Casper","credit_id":"68cd83c48911150f37fe89cd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosima Henman","original_name":"Cosima Henman","popularity":0.6444,"profile_path":"/3idZ7c2uNN6wiqdA8QuLUq6oK4k.jpg","credit_id":"68cd84f2d9c0ebc2d2fe89f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosima Henman","original_name":"Cosima Henman","popularity":0.6444,"profile_path":"/3idZ7c2uNN6wiqdA8QuLUq6oK4k.jpg","credit_id":"68cd85037e792b4cb07a3a7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosima Henman","original_name":"Cosima Henman","popularity":0.6444,"profile_path":"/3idZ7c2uNN6wiqdA8QuLUq6oK4k.jpg","credit_id":"68cd851a5d5442f1e1cc29de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lukas Richter","original_name":"Lukas Richter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cd85b836ea691370cd6c84","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322943,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcus Kanter","original_name":"Marcus Kanter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cd85d5d8fd93ce17ceb86e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lukas Richter","original_name":"Lukas Richter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cd85ee15945877f2fe8a01","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5698886,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Estella Thiel","original_name":"Estella Thiel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cd86042fba41929e748e33","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZPMZUud7GZlgHadarouZ0SRw7g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
