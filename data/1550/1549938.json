The filmmaker, Eugeniusz CÄ™kalski, was associated with the environment of the film avant-garde, hence the use of treatments unusual for a documentary film. \"Kujawiak\" is not only a recording of a folk dance, but above all an artistic reportage, showing the dancers from different perspectives in a rural setting, using close-ups and slow-motion shots. The film featured the Folk Theater Association's Dance Ensemble. \"Kujawiak\" is one of the films comprising the famous \"Polish Dances\" series (along with \"Highland Dances,\" \"Cracow Dances\" and \"Silesian Dances\"). The entire series made its way to Great Britain before the war (for foreign distribution it was prepared in an English-language version), thanks to which it has been preserved until our times.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuyaviak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugeniusz Cekalski","original_name":"Eugeniusz Cekalski","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/8bsd1Bbre45CpGxeZYDc7Pl3L0G.jpg","credit_id":"68d0318a36ea691370cd77e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0989017","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
