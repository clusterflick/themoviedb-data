Rejected by family, condemned by religion, and hunted by societal transphobia, Alex journeys through a dark, metaphorical forest haunted by a masquerade symbolizing fear and erasure. Blending suspense and the supernatural, the film powerfully explores identity, resilience, and the struggle to live authentically, while advocating for acceptance and the right to selfhood.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tYPUlWX5OgUMu1Dy5cS5SxcMDoE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unburied","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5702859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Maduagwu","original_name":"Alexandra Maduagwu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68d039c5ece74752f9749b0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5702860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agumuo Osinachi","original_name":"Agumuo Osinachi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68d03a1502048cfe22ac8432","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5702862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolapo Osunsina","original_name":"Dolapo Osunsina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68d03a29fea4692874ac837f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayo Lawson","original_name":"Ayo Lawson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d0399b1fe1eea1cecec496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayo Lawson","original_name":"Ayo Lawson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d039a233e4eab140ac81cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2712882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uyaiedu Ikpe-Etim","original_name":"Uyaiedu Ikpe-Etim","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ztB0wbRpIlG2y0aQuphrFD6nReS.jpg","credit_id":"68d039ae5e2bcb54397499a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tYPUlWX5OgUMu1Dy5cS5SxcMDoE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
