As the only island in Ireland to have been both Protetstant and Irish speaking, it is not surprising that Inis Bigil has developed a character all of its own. However today, with only 23 remaining inhabitants, the islanders now find themselves at a crossroads. Focusing on the story of the island’s most famous inhabitant Padraig Daeid (an tailliúr gorm), the film interweaves past and present, exploring the island’s rich culture and heritage, as it faces into perhaps its greatest challenge yet.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mDSYyTOF0gRmClWTkxF6aOPnXOa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cahill
