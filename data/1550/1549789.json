One of the participating delegations is from Timbiquí, a town located on the banks of the river of the same name. This town, nestled in the middle of the Pacific rainforest of Cauca, will be represented by three groups at the eighth edition of the festival. Two of the groups are in Timbiquí and are getting ready for the trip. The third, made up of young people, decides to leave their village to settle in the city and make a living from music. For all three groups, this event is an opportunity not only to showcase the folklore of their land, inherited from their ancestors, but also to fulfil their dreams.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universidad del
