A lush, uniquely pastoral tableau emerges, while echoes of the omnipresent city resonate off camera. Against this backdrop, a double menace lurks: that of the impending disappearance of this green space, to be replaced by asphalt, and that, more dramatic, of the disappearance of a generation of immigrants, born in the countryside but urbanized by fate, who have come here in search of their rural roots, reviving the ageold traditions of the land they left behind. Over the seasons of planting, harvesting and friendly conversation, the common theme that emerges is that of the land.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hJKQs6gfdIzVQbGNjnOAm7FaWHv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":274604,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les vues du jardin","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Haitian; Haitian Creole","iso_639_1":"ht","name":""},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Garden Under the Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Baillargeon","original_name":"Bruno Baillargeon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/j1iCA36nVxmdpnG2gnAandHzpzZ.jpg","credit_id":"68cd8ea514789c92b3d40e00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Baillargeon","original_name":"Bruno Baillargeon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/j1iCA36nVxmdpnG2gnAandHzpzZ.jpg","credit_id":"68cd8eaca1a3d96f8fac7643","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Baillargeon","original_name":"Bruno Baillargeon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/j1iCA36nVxmdpnG2gnAandHzpzZ.jpg","credit_id":"68cd8f174a73372dcdceb8e0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Baillargeon","original_name":"Bruno Baillargeon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/j1iCA36nVxmdpnG2gnAandHzpzZ.jpg","credit_id":"68cd8f1c4d9f637b84d40dbc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Roberge","original_name":"René Roberge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gG0bcyFZvHWSZGBKWGG3vYlPc9g.jpg","credit_id":"68cd8f23c835f4eb2ccc2a5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114358,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Calvert","original_name":"Olivier Calvert","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/e3iZCsoamtUcVDmN1rwsxAJVFgr.jpg","credit_id":"68cd8f308d3d4b8861cc2a11","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2960873,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clovis Gouaillier","original_name":"Clovis Gouaillier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68cd8f392fba41929e748e7c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hJKQs6gfdIzVQbGNjnOAm7FaWHv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Approximative Date","release_date":"2009-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
