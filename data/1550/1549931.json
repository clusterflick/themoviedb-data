It was a grand celebration, not only religious, but also national, attended by state dignitaries headed by President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki and Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. Despite a storm and rain, Vilnius was visited by thousands of pilgrims, including Poles from the Kaunas region, which is part of Lithuania, for whom it was also a patriotic manifestation. Just 2 days later, on 4 July, a film account of the ceremony was screened at Warsaw's Colosseum cinema. In 2023, the film was reconstructed based on three incomplete copies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coronation of the Icon of Our Lady of the Dawn Gate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
