The last survives another day... Pop Goes the Weasel. Welcome to Junior's world where six invited guests, trapped in a room, play a deadly game of musical chairs for their lives.

Jack in the Box is a gripping study in psychological terror, unfolding in real-time, as Junior's desperate \"guests\" struggle with themselves, and each other, for survival. Seven begin the game, only one will end it. Who will it be? Grab a chair and find out. The answer will shock you.","popularity":0.1655,"poster_path":"/zZeiSLaQTSZRoSRPK27hDxljjvd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack in the Box","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chairs","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Guerra","original_name":"Lynn Guerra","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lynn","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f956f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":547190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathaniel Sylva","original_name":"Nathaniel Sylva","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/s1nzgdzqfhkMBo1f7tO4hcLYC7G.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nathaniel","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f9573","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassandra Waterman","original_name":"Cassandra Waterman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cassandra","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f9577","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam LaFramboise","original_name":"Adam LaFramboise","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f957b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":253883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William White","original_name":"William White","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Will","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f957f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Richeson","original_name":"Emilia Richeson","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Emilia","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f9583","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Doherty Jr.","original_name":"Bill Doherty Jr.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f9587","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Duncan","original_name":"Denise Duncan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f958b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Phillips","original_name":"Evan Phillips","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jack Jr.","credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f958f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566688,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lesley Glorioso","original_name":"Lesley Glorioso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f9595","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27569,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Norman Hollyn","original_name":"Norman Hollyn","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4875c3a368484e0f95ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael E.
