NOTE: This is a French *edited* version of the 1995 original anime film by Akinori Nagaoka, which is listed as some minutes longer (102, while the France edit is cut down to 88). The edited version also replaced the original musical score with a more orchestral soundtrack. First shown in 1999 via festivals (some with an English dub), then released on DVD in 2000 with French audio & English subtitles, it took a while for an official English dub to be released next, but a trailer was posted on YouTube in April of 2015. The edited film with an English-audio dub was finally made available for free on YouTube as of May 2020. The \"original\" title in the info on TMDB is incorrectly in English but locked; the English should be in the \"translated title\" spot. It's in French on a poster though: Le Journal d'Anne Frank.","popularity":0.217,"poster_path":"/v7gMwCqmIHDeRkRpdwg06wxgKRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animation Production Multimedia Investment","origin_country":""},{"id":186435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associated Studios Global Toon Network","origin_country":""},{"id":186436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brookfield BS","origin_country":""},{"id":186437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cleeve Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":186438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Globe Trotter Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anne Frank's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le journal d'Anne Frank","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Anne Frank's Diary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marissa Davison","original_name":"Marissa Davison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Anne Frank (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f6994e4dff0139e289e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Ackerman","original_name":"Vanessa Ackerman","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Margot Frank (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f6c6253fab0c3e9e6d41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1614653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bela Grushka","original_name":"Bela Grushka","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Edith Frank (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f6de4e4dff00c5fd7f97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1237651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Wenger","original_name":"Allan Wenger","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Otto Frank (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f6fcba48020105dd2372","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estelle Heinaux","original_name":"Estelle Heinaux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lies (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f746d236e600c586e256","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miep Gies","original_name":"Miep Gies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b0f7781685da00e46b8864","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Pick-Goslar","original_name":"Hannah Pick-Goslar","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64b0f795d236e60139b3461f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Kessler","original_name":"Patricia Kessler","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Madame Van Daan (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f846ba48020143468a50","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Saint-Just","original_name":"Jacques Saint-Just","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Peter Van Daan (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f8624e4dff00e2f8a3a0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Fontaine","original_name":"Jean Fontaine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Docteur Dussel (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f8b22cde9800cb8404c2","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Gadler","original_name":"Steve Gadler","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Koophuis (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f8f14e4dff011c7bc8d5","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertie Cortez","original_name":"Bertie Cortez","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Professor Kepler (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f908ba480201243403b3","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Wallasch","original_name":"Peter Wallasch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"German soldier (voice)","credit_id":"64b0f923253fab0c39ba8166","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4250469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Shuman","original_name":"James Shuman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Monsieur Van Dann (voice)","credit_id":"653e6aae5907de0138e21fe0","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Y.
