Rosina is now the Countess; Dr. Bartolo is seeking revenge against Figaro for thwarting his plans to marry Rosina himself; and Count Almaviva has degenerated from the romantic youth of Barber into a scheming, bullying, skirt-chasing baritone. This follows the Count trying to obtain favours from Susanna, Figaro's bride to be, under the nose of the Countess.","popularity":0.1843,"poster_path":"/p2wY3pM7K8escpsSODI9iZaajua.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":189,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le nozze di Figaro","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le nozze di Figaro 2006 D1","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le nozze di Figaro 2006 D2","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Finley","original_name":"Gerald Finley","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/EwljhDl70GjWTicg3bR5sxFzXL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Figaro","credit_id":"61c71fa0d861af0099172af6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Hagley","original_name":"Alison Hagley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Susanna","credit_id":"61c71fbc2ac499006054f0e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":269139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Fleming","original_name":"Renée Fleming","popularity":0.3384,"profile_path":"/7L6CEpZS2eYmKZquDTFTSpEbTiz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Countess","credit_id":"61c71fd5a93d250061ae3088","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Schmidt","original_name":"Andreas Schmidt","popularity":0.2017,"profile_path":"/2o5gt8z698s94p0mTccsLy6Djat.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Count Almaviva","credit_id":"61c71ff748333a008876a783","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"61c7203ab6c264008ef0cc6e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Medcalf","original_name":"Stephen Medcalf","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c72082ecaef50042a44063","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1254288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernard Haitink","original_name":"Bernard Haitink","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c72199ecaef50042a4416d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3030744,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"John Gunter","original_name":"John Gunter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c72239a93d25008b8445f8","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058953,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Pat Collins","original_name":"Pat Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c7226033ad8f00439c4bd7","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p2wY3pM7K8escpsSODI9iZaajua.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1385}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
