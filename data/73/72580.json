Punjab-based Balbir Singh is one such member of the Fauj, who has left his wife, Amrita, and son, Veer, behind. Ironically, Amrita is a follower of Mohandas Gandhi, and patiently awaits her husband's return home. Mohandas writes to Adolf, addressing him as 'dear friend', imploring him to end the violence. The allies, which include America, Russia, Britain and France close in on the Germans, while Adolf, a little perturbed by defectors, but still in company of many loyal supporters, is determined to continue, and even makes preparations to wed his mistress of 12 years, Eva Braun. Meanwhile Balbir and the rest of the Fauj must risk their lives through treacherous territory..","popularity":0.5663,"poster_path":"/lFbJof90OPImS1lvCYhORnFiibZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gandhi to Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neha Dhupia","original_name":"नेहा धूपिया","popularity":0.7012,"profile_path":"/tZh9EOs1pEiu9iqRl4gwTubIfAh.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Eva Braun","credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f91a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aman Verma","original_name":"Aman Verma","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Balbir Singh","credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f918d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avijit Dutt","original_name":"Avijit Dutt","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/5pNmHClvtaieNjTTrT4tjkWQYrw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi","credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f9191","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nassar Abdulla","original_name":"Nassar Abdulla","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":"/pUbMk4GeYX1Dyq7Jep0NtFqPOIA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Albert Speer","credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f9195","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Anand","original_name":"Nikita Anand","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/xfBjD1MMKwOn96aKdMZkwtolpbv.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Magda Goebbels","credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f9199","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nalin Singh","original_name":"Nalin Singh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Joseph Goebbels","credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f919d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raghubir Yadav","original_name":"Raghubir Yadav","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":"/khyp4vnuGKVxrtszyB7kSf3vuzw.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Adolf Hitler","credit_id":"57de2e339251417855006df6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rakesh Ranjan Kumar","original_name":"Rakesh Ranjan Kumar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f916d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rakesh Ranjan Kumar","original_name":"Rakesh Ranjan Kumar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f9173","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120774,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nalin Singh","original_name":"Nalin Singh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f9179","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123224,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fuwad Khan","original_name":"Fuwad Khan","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f917f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123225,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shree Narayan Singh","original_name":"Shree Narayan Singh","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4874c3a368484e0f9185","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449560,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Neeraj Gupta","original_name":"Neeraj Gupta","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc16090470ead00138a67f4","department":"Production","job":"Publicist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1980970","wikidata_id":"Q5246862","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JfPxvibTd7Wso5NzwVmOMgkxCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lFbJof90OPImS1lvCYhORnFiibZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":7926,"name":"mahatma gandhi"},{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
