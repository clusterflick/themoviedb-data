While DD struggles to make an honest living, his older brother, Darnell, has risen to become the neighborhood kingpin. DD faces the pressure to save his younger brother, James, from following in Darnellâ€™s dangerous footsteps. Tommy and DD find themselves trapped in the same slum they joined the military to escape.
