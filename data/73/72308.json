Left without options or entrance visas, a beacon of hope materialized for them on the other side of the world, and in the unlikeliest of places, Japanese-controlled Shanghai. Fleeing for their lives, these Jewish refugees journeyed to form a settlement in the exotic city, penniless and unprepared for their new life in the Far East. At the turn of the new millennium, filmmakers Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amire Mann boldly snuck into China with two survivors and a digital camera to shoot at the site of the original Shanghai Ghetto, unchanged since WWII.","popularity":0.3812,"poster_path":"/pSnmc99khdKV0VmfYvAENK6T4ko.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1939, the last hope for thousands of Jews lay in the last place on Earth the Nazis would look.","title":"Shanghai Ghetto","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Landau","original_name":"Martin Landau","popularity":0.9743,"profile_path":"/2BkrH2w5W1lbv8YQQeEHX6mYiEX.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4863c3a368484e0f62d3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":565446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Janklowicz-Mann","original_name":"Dana Janklowicz-Mann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4863c3a368484e0f62cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0318068","wikidata_id":"Q7488451","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pSnmc99khdKV0VmfYvAENK6T4ko.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
