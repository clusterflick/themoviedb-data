Mary's employers, are trying to strike an oil related business deal with a rich man by the name of Nelson Rogers. The deal does not seem to be on the table, as Mr. Rogers is leaving town shortly and does not have the time to work out the details of such a deal. In an order to entice him to stay, Mrs. Mallory - wife of Mr. Mallory who is proposing the business deal - convinces Mary to be her guest at a dinner party with the intent of making Mr. Rogers fall for her and thus stay long enough for Mr. Mallory to make him agree to a business deal.","popularity":0.5436,"poster_path":"/mwVNfWHi8Jw7x1n0I5sfMflHY26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden Fruit","video":false,"vote_average":6.35,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Zakazny owoc","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Ayres","original_name":"Agnes Ayres","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/mQObJxwBA3epElaMwpDsXCvaQeH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Maddock","credit_id":"5658d68cc3a3683085004161","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Steve Maddock","credit_id":"5658d69dc3a3683093003f41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Roberts","original_name":"Theodore Roberts","popularity":0.285,"profile_path":"/zyNQbifLkL42CaVvRKh2tG659q4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Harrington Mallory","credit_id":"5658d6f79251416ddb003e45","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathlyn Williams","original_name":"Kathlyn Williams","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/j8BcTXV2h98p04pYjRLtEe9LHvV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Mallory","credit_id":"5658d709c3a36830800040d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Stanley","original_name":"Forrest Stanley","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/3OUSDzqlX2Hqz2hRxwXbrTwObNK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nelson Rogers","credit_id":"5658d7199251416dd8003e24","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Kosloff","original_name":"Theodore Kosloff","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/pP89GUmPhDgEoCAE0LSsI04WVGb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pietro Giuseppe","credit_id":"5658d75a9251416dd3003ed7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon Day","original_name":"Shannon Day","popularity":0.1834,"profile_path":"/wciC2BHSGbrBQDToZZrdzdJiF5w.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nadia Craig","credit_id":"5658d771c3a368308b003cda","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Johns","original_name":"Bertram Johns","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"John Craig","credit_id":"5658d78f9251416dde003e7f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Faye","original_name":"Julia Faye","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":"/eSA5VSoh8CIg7SjREn4yWBmbObW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Mallory's First Maid","credit_id":"5658d7ab9251416dd100405b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Boyd","original_name":"William Boyd","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/iQNPrDYIzyHRFHmUWe3gjVA2s4r.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Billiards Player","credit_id":"5658d7d6c3a3683096003e5b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Nagel","original_name":"Conrad Nagel","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/eq8mN5jfRlkKhU0AlOtbSTtZdeS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Actor In Play 'Forbidden Fruit' (uncredited)","credit_id":"5658d7edc3a368308300400a","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecil B.
