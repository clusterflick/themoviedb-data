PINAFORE makes arrangements for his daughter to marry the Lord Admiral of the Navy. However, problems ensue when his daughter reveals she’s in love with a low-ranking seaman aboard her father’s ship. Ironically, the Captain finds himself in a similar position with a dockside vendor called Little Buttercup. The whole situation is turned on its head when Little Buttercup reveals a game-changing secret she has kept for decades...  This is no ordinary production of G&S. It fairly zings along, bubbling with joie de vivre, good humour and spice. However, you won't like this version of Pinafore if you're a strict G&S traditionalist. Considerable liberties are taken with the script; two songs are left out and several songs adapted from other G&S operas are added; Act II has been radically changed - and the music is played on three Moog synthesizers, with never a violin in sight!","popularity":0.2536,"poster_path":"/wcV3JWvwIZzvRrArgdkDIjef8UE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HMS Pinafore","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1233700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon English","original_name":"Jon English","popularity":0.4912,"profile_path":"/sp47Dz4CYDgZKQCHozIosTa14XF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Dick Deadeye","credit_id":"586f5dc892514133750014ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Gallaher","original_name":"Simon Gallaher","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/rX2JpKW5tGsHl0h3QLul1xR02ZA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ralph Rackstraw","credit_id":"586f5df092514133630015a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1732370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Donaldson","original_name":"Helen Donaldson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/xnnSwkjUGUhd8d1Ou3yDDicN2oi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Josephine Corcoran","credit_id":"594e8950925141311103a053","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Forsythe","original_name":"Drew Forsythe","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/z8295bQqwwOwA6fI3uf8PWYSlCy.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Rt.
