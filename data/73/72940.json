BLAME IT ON THE FISH documents the tour in typical Primus (i.e. weird) fashion with an appropriately bizarre collection of live-performance clips, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage, as well as bonus material that includes a \"futuristic\" mockumentary that reimagines the band 60 years into the future.","popularity":0.157,"poster_path":"/gw7sxrLLr6KKnP34uPyZUshYbpg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frizzle Fry, Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":171577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Powers Philms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primus - Blame It On The Fish","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Claypool","original_name":"Les Claypool","popularity":0.2041,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4885c3a368484e0fd015","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":199819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Lalonde","original_name":"Larry Lalonde","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"622f899d0e44190079a845b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Alexander","original_name":"Tim Alexander","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"622f8a24e04aca0045a20a59","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frizzle Fry Inc.","original_name":"Frizzle Fry Inc.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f9ffaa6fdaa001b8195b0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465696,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fred Heim","original_name":"Fred Heim","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622fa1f12866fa008082753c","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew J.
