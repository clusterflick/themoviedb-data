By night, his nephew Jules takes the wheel. They adore each other. This evening, however, Tonton is celebrating his sixtieth birthday in the bar on the corner; for the first time ever, Jules misses the celebration. Tonton doesn't hold it against him though, since Jules -30 and still a virgin- has at last fallen for a woman. The night before she fell asleep in his cab. Not wanting to wake her, the young man left the meter running and dropped off in turn. By dawn, the beautiful passenger had fled without leaving an address...and without paying the bill.","popularity":0.1247,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un type bien","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Beigel","original_name":"Alain Beigel","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/eMfZGItXcEXwADStfMxlN5Lp3N2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62663eb5d1a8937094c58e17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Billerey","original_name":"Raoul Billerey","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/nxCLEhdYHhkjsRYDTAEYpKf8wu3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62663ebf75f1ad00aab31456","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Brousse","original_name":"Michel Brousse","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62663ec9d1a893709380eab0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Cavenelle","original_name":"Christine Cavenelle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62663ed1f495ee303b6408b2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laurent Bénégui","original_name":"Laurent Bénégui","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2156b1c3a3681c34ebdeeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103155","wikidata_id":"Q111212034","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
