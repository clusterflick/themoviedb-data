When several workers at a tire factory suffer violence at the hands of the loan sharkers, a union leader and the factory owner try to recruit ex-con Joe Gargan to infiltrate to the gang. At first Joe does not want to get involved, but changes his mind when his brother-in-law dies at the hands of a savage loan shark hood. Joe works his way into the mob, but in order to keep his cover, Joe can't tell anyone what he is up to. This results in him being disowned by his sister and girl friend.","popularity":1.5,"poster_path":"/8sPhgo59wszKz2KCDKmWdXv4yAz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encore Productions Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He knows every racket's strength... and every woman's weakness!","title":"Loan Shark","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Raft","original_name":"George Raft","popularity":0.579,"profile_path":"/rTNM6gZpPduQfPb5UrDmYj48ALk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Joe Gargen","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8625","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Hart","original_name":"Dorothy Hart","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":"/30OmzFcCZZcCoxx38E7MVgmBidj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ann Nelson","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8629","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Stewart","original_name":"Paul Stewart","popularity":0.42,"profile_path":"/8dsAzDIErQFdPAZOJaaVGrohdnf.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lou Donelli","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f862d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hoyt","original_name":"John Hoyt","popularity":0.8292,"profile_path":"/rtm0wKVwtsn8dyBHPQB9jWlSIcT.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Vince Phillips","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8631","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Westcott","original_name":"Helen Westcott","popularity":0.2656,"profile_path":"/oF3eOcS70IjF9WVRXRNjywco4GX.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Martha Gargen Haines","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8635","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Slate","original_name":"Henry Slate","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/rnZONEwPuBuhY0nPJJGcemSdDVR.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Paul Nelson","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8639","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Johnson","original_name":"Russell Johnson","popularity":0.7801,"profile_path":"/lDPl3KlE61o9ROvjsEfeJWYkFhl.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Charlie Thompson","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f863d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margia Dean","original_name":"Margia Dean","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":"/kR5sdSS7RjSRQ1e73v2Chn6KYfI.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Ivy","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8641","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Baker","original_name":"Benny Baker","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/jOdEf2SQCtROQHQfbJp9Ox5jgx5.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Tubby","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8645","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Dobkin","original_name":"Lawrence Dobkin","popularity":0.5799,"profile_path":"/3GnsSfYAspOTILATAKjumIzJggd.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Walter Kerr","credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f8649","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3990608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spring Mitchell","original_name":"Spring Mitchell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1D7ewCLKvRVowH3Rvwi1fsH4YJl.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Nancy","credit_id":"64293809a3e4ba00d3adfc67","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94510,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene Ling","original_name":"Eugene Ling","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f85fd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566277,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernard Luber","original_name":"Bernard Luber","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4871c3a368484e0f860f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14431,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph F.
