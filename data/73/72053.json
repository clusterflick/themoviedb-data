But what else can she do in such a sleepy village where even her best friend Katharina no longer has any time for her. When Eva is found dead, the whole village is in turmoil. The presumed killer is quickly arrested: Clemens, the sexton of the local community and a peeping-tom. Katharina becomes more and more suspicious when she finds one of Eva's earrings in the church.
