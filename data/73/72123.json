Although such films have succeeded in drawing public attention to the issue of global warming, they have repeatedly ignored one of the most important causes of climate change: the intensive livestock production. Meat the Truth draws attention to this by demonstrating that livestock farming generates more greenhouse gas emissions worldwide than all cars, lorries, trains, boats and planes added together.","popularity":0.2399,"poster_path":"/jVHDMu5UIA5LlvD8jh9gYKg7IYw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meat the Truth","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Uma Verdade Mais que Inconveniente","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341746","wikidata_id":"Q2122155","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tnHua6JOuZHwISR4WZ8onKjrh1D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jVHDMu5UIA5LlvD8jh9gYKg7IYw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":8271,"name":"meat"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":175322,"name":"vegan"},{"id":175980,"name":"greenhouse gases"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
