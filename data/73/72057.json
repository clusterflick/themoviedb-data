We discover the 5 years-old Elena being brought up by her aunts (Marco Bellocchio's sisters) because her mother Sara is trying to succeed as an actress in Milan. Her uncle Giorgio has a difficult relationship with his sister and judges her for not taking care of her daughter. But as soon as Sara can afford it, she offers to take Elena with her, leaving the village and her aunts, perhaps for ever - while Giorgio, up to his eyeballs in debt, takes refuge in Bobbio. His sister will help him and sell a house.","popularity":0.3019,"poster_path":"/6cpmZoAJyvDnbcTImeLS9NFpaa0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63459,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kavac Film","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorelle Mai","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pier Giorgio Bellocchio","original_name":"Pier Giorgio Bellocchio","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/hZTd1cLRnlB9eibCZTeBq1UvDOQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giorgio","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Bellocchio","original_name":"Elena Bellocchio","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elena","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatella Finocchiaro","original_name":"Donatella Finocchiaro","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/zAcHyOB6O3vN0hKs8PwxOyw2Ngd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sara Mai","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Letizia Bellocchio","original_name":"Letizia Bellocchio","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Letizia","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Luisa Bellocchio","original_name":"Maria Luisa Bellocchio","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mariuccia","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Schicchi","original_name":"Gianni Schicchi","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gianni Schicchi","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39c7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alba Rohrwacher","original_name":"Alba Rohrwacher","popularity":0.8142,"profile_path":"/swffcvnDnj5966fdLSnXOMY186.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Professoressa Vitaliani","credit_id":"65a6dc53cedac401227fd46b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Bellocchio","original_name":"Marco Bellocchio","popularity":0.2166,"profile_path":"/oWTqhEVf4iLLEf11JnBH2waIhRh.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Bellocchio","original_name":"Marco Bellocchio","popularity":0.2166,"profile_path":"/oWTqhEVf4iLLEf11JnBH2waIhRh.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4855c3a368484e0f39af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689778,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Irma Misantoni","original_name":"Irma Misantoni","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f56cf39251416813001366","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689779,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marco Sgorbati","original_name":"Marco Sgorbati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f56d079251410e360006b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438845,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francesca Calvelli","original_name":"Francesca Calvelli","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/yvjYL2pUGDIEyvLXjMdEqx80Kkp.jpg","credit_id":"57f56d149251410df50006f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1698566","wikidata_id":"Q3965057","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eYseFanWzUKkG7klm2GyYj981Uk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6cpmZoAJyvDnbcTImeLS9NFpaa0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/oXUdwQQygs0ck3LymsY8tPjg8Am.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
