He, a scientist, snatches his daughter from the examining table at the clinic and takes her away as if to kidnap her from the disease. His ex-wife, an actress, takes to bed weeping uncontrollably when she learns of her daughter's tumor. The girl's step-mother, an Asian-American physician, is clinical in her response, outlining a treatment regimen of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. It is left to the girl herself, ten-year-old Violette, to be calm, reassuring, philosophical, and even metaphysical as she faces death.","popularity":0.2928,"poster_path":"/lXyFWTpsVHD8fgTFzSQDs5juUJU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alia
