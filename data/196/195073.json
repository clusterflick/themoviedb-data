The inscription “Charlemagne 53790K” readable on the turret suggests that this view was shot in the vicinity of Saint-Chamond, a town where there are factories specializing in the construction of heavy steel. It is certainly a turret intended for the battleship “Charlemagne”. In addition, a view projected by the Aléthorama on January 20, 1898 in Saint-Étienne, and entitled “Transportation of the armored turret of Saint-Chamond by a team of 80 horses”, could represent the same event.","popularity":0.344,"poster_path":"/bqqEMl5v5a0Y7x0IiwNDweI5lGU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1897-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transport of a Turret by a Team of 60 Horses","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1867,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Auguste Lumière","original_name":"Auguste Lumière","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"535398e90e0a26560e00484d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Lumière","original_name":"Louis Lumière","popularity":0.2875,"profile_path":"/1Hh4lEqRWOrB4kybXJF6JdCchy.jpg","credit_id":"535399030e0a2655fe00469e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1741591","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXnct4fV9NTc6extY0C5W3r4dc4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bqqEMl5v5a0Y7x0IiwNDweI5lGU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2673,"name":"horse"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":261338,"name":"transport"},{"id":311854,"name":"horse transport"},{"id":311855,"name":"turret"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1897-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
