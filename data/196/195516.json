Famous shots from the movie include the first-ever aerial pictures of the tops of Africa's highest peaks, Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya. Along the journey, Martin filmed Osa surrounded by a pride of Lions and together they captured amazing scenes of a baboon colony, an event striking enough to give the movie its name.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":"/h0Tftz5bhD9LCLtPSHzofkSItxI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"1935-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baboona","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin E.
