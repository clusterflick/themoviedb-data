Naming the dog Dalkeith after the home, they discover she is a phenomenal runner and she is soon entered into the greyhound races. Soon residents are betting on the outcome of the races, and they are given a new reason to live. But the board of trustees learn what is going on, through the disgruntled daughter of one of the residents, and heavily handedly put an end to the fun and games. After the board's intervention the residents sink into a new form of despair as life becomes even duller and more boring than before. That is until the aloof pensioner, played by Ray Barrett, reveals he was once a high profile barrister and challenges the decision in court.","popularity":1.0568,"poster_path":"/jcji4fuMbp6PB6G7sZlqYcaWt55.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transfilm
