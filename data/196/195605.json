The buxom landlady isn't averse to anything and even the quirky valet Beppo takes what he can get. It is also interesting to note that the last count and countess, who were summoned to their ancestors at a very young age, still haunt the halls. A special attraction for visitors is the nearby spa station of the shepherd Astloch, whose cures have a very invigorating effect on certain parts of the body. In the Spessart, people not only sing and rob, but also indulge in physical pleasures.","popularity":0.1265,"poster_path":"/uK3DZp3L8Tm5lygzkJJ3AB5och9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252446,"logo_path":null,"name":"EFC-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das
