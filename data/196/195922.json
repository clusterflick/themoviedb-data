Their first suspect has ties to the pro-life movement. But a sudden turn of events, a fresh trail of clues and a suicide attempt by the victim's Serbian husband lead the detectives into the impenetrable world of Balkan politics and prejudices. As they hunt for the killer, they uncover an ethnic war between Croatians and Serbians amid the urban backdrop of downtown Toronto.","popularity":1.6598,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26139,"logo_path":"/li2ebL9Oms1wWnrsVp4fndXwy3E.png","name":"Salter Street Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing Cain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Outerbridge","original_name":"Peter Outerbridge","popularity":0.753,"profile_path":"/nYH7DMzfqw511KQCe4z3gUBLzf6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bob Kozlowski","credit_id":"52fe4d209251416c9110b877","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberta Watson","original_name":"Alberta Watson","popularity":0.6529,"profile_path":"/zUShDQufrKQcpnRYchZX6iNPwm7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Denise McGoogan","credit_id":"52fe4d209251416c9110b87b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Wright","original_name":"Janet Wright","popularity":0.1965,"profile_path":"/dH35SuZX5RBxZ35XJNWV27Qs0nG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sonia","credit_id":"52fe4d209251416c9110b87f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aron Tager","original_name":"Aron Tager","popularity":0.4493,"profile_path":"/x0SaQPESodCUD0QB0i2hGu9GcYl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rad","credit_id":"52fe4d209251416c9110b883","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Wilson","original_name":"Mark Wilson","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/iHW7nCNRHyvD28VzStRZlVgMBcp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Det.
