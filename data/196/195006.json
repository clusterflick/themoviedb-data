Alberto (Paulo César Pereio) is an intellectual and professor who announces to his friend and pupil Polidoro (Nuno Leal Maia) he won a scholarship to study in Paris. In Paris Polidoro receives a letter in which Alberto announces that he married Helena (Ana Maria Nascimento e Silva). Polidoro returns to Brazil in 1945, when there was a strong political agitation against the New State. Alberto invites Polidoro to spend a few days at his home in Campos do Jordão. After reaching the site he is told by Helena that Alberto was forced to travel urgently. She insists he should stay there until the return of her husband and, while waiting, she seduces him. Then, after several days of intense passion, she orders Polidoro to go away and never see her again.","popularity":0.3321,"poster_path":"/5cOOj3Q8ESBaeRAPICIesPOtjXM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1982-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's
