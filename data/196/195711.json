Next comes a chemical engine mounted on a stout double runner sled, which is followed closely by hose carriage apparatus mounted also on double runner sleds. Next comes a water tower mounted on a set of double runners and drawn by four beautiful horses. This is followed very closely by an engine drawn by a four-horse string team. This is followed by another engine on double runners, drawn by a four-horse tandem team. A second hose carriage and a Protective Insurance outfit brings up the rear. The breath leaves the horses' nostrils in great white puffs as they gallop through the snow-covered streets.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1901-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montreal Fire Department on Runners","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William C.
