Currently the line is not completed and the \"connection\" is reduced to Figueres-Perpignan, which spans the border between France and Spain through the tunnel Pertús.  A story about the different perceptions of time on the cohabitation between the high and low speed at a border point between the process of building a viaduct and people living with the transformation of the landscape in a rural setting. The high-speed and half-reality, as a future that is constantly coming, the low speed as a present to disappear.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Velocidad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Velocitat","type":"Catalan title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivó Vinuesa","original_name":"Ivó Vinuesa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d209251416c9110b933","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
