The beautiful and picturesque sites which exist in Switzerland have given us an opportunity of utilising the resources our theatre affords, and our scene-painters have been able to have a free run on their imaginations, and have completed the work by a series of magnificent scenes in the most artistic character.","popularity":0.1812,"poster_path":"/ayCshlwDp4Jut0FWqCCOMpeX2Ax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1903-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"William Tell","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"William Tell","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Guillermo Tell","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucien Nonguet","original_name":"Lucien Nonguet","popularity":0.0677,"profile_path":"/avsz3vRmL5yYlYcTPaaCP9v2ewa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d219251416c9110ba59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162692,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Friedrich Schiller","original_name":"Friedrich Schiller","popularity":0.2626,"profile_path":"/twQVdSrjsXD6yWAzWEGLtoMKVJm.jpg","credit_id":"6751f69780e5b8f0a7561863","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0457927","wikidata_id":"Q12147270","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayCshlwDp4Jut0FWqCCOMpeX2Ax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1903-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Guillaume Tell [William Tell] (Lucien Nonguet, 1903) Français/English","key":"Qb1W8qI_YJk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-26T18:45:34.000Z","id":"6524f912fd63000139e53b0d"}]}}}
