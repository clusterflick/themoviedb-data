One four-hour performance known as Melodrama Sacramentral was staged in May 1965 at the Paris Festival of Free Expression. The \"happening\" starred Jodorowsky dressed in motorcyclist leather and featured him slitting the throats of two geese, taping two snakes to his chest and having himself stripped and whipped. Other scenes included a staged murder of a rabbi, a crucified chicken, a giant vagina giving birth to Jodorowsky, naked women covered in honey and the throwing of live turtles into the audience.","popularity":0.1476,"poster_path":"/rRKkf06RNOcYfoFEk2mj4GOQibs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melodrama Sacramental","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","original_name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","popularity":0.5741,"profile_path":"/rNLy0GHNAdq4TpWOY0yVEnc1lyb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5367676ac3a36812260043e5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","original_name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","popularity":0.5741,"profile_path":"/rNLy0GHNAdq4TpWOY0yVEnc1lyb.jpg","credit_id":"53676715c3a368124100466a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101481,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luc Perrinin","original_name":"Luc Perrinin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648c4a7c559d2200ad81532c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281231,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Michel Humeau","original_name":"Jean-Michel Humeau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648c4b11c3c891014ebcc12a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1808523","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rRKkf06RNOcYfoFEk2mj4GOQibs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
