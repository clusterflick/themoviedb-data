Much of the original has been re-worked: the 'found footage' has been re-shot, slowed down, tinted, and re-edited with a sound track of minimalist composition. As a result, the exotica of colonial travel and sport take on new and sinister meanings. The acts of violence, especially those of hunting, recur in patterns that suggest visually that war is a logical development. A close examination of the work, starting with the opening sequence of a railway journey, explores the centrality of questions of memory and history to this remarkable and influential film.","popularity":0.1886,"poster_path":"/nZNET46AOs5AhhE1I4socH56x7s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gianikian-Ricci Lucchi","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1987-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Pole to the Equator","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raimondo Franchetti","original_name":"Raimondo Franchetti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself (archive footage) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5e2d3cb098f1f10018fae610","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1175635,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Anderson","original_name":"Charles Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d099251416c9110869d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yervant Gianikian","original_name":"Yervant Gianikian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d099251416c9110868b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angela Ricci Lucchi","original_name":"Angela Ricci Lucchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d099251416c91108691","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1175634,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Ullrich","original_name":"Keith Ullrich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d099251416c91108697","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
