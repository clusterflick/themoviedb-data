Precocious, to say the least, Angela has visions of Lucifer coming to take her and her sister away, and one of her remedies for this is for them to remain within a circle of their dolls and toys until they see a vision of the virgin Mary come to them. But such thinking can only lead to an ending befitting of her own mental state.","popularity":2.0941,"poster_path":"/fhxU3jFzC2tlBgqFhB7NqO4qAFe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tree Farm Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miranda Rhyne","original_name":"Miranda Rhyne","popularity":0.1224,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"52fe44de9251416c9101faaf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":196180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Eve Blythe","original_name":"Charlotte Eve Blythe","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Ellie","credit_id":"52fe44de9251416c9101fab3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Thomson","original_name":"Anna Thomson","popularity":0.6771,"profile_path":"/pTWFTT619UlEfS6KuDsmX2WN9cT.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Mae","credit_id":"52fe44de9251416c9101fab7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ventimiglia","original_name":"John Ventimiglia","popularity":0.5502,"profile_path":"/1KSrI47Q3mdb3XXoEpiNaZoWsGp.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Andrew","credit_id":"556764f992514156bb00027d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"iO Tillett Wright","original_name":"iO Tillett Wright","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"56e6b76a92514115a200332c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Gallo","original_name":"Vincent Gallo","popularity":0.9254,"profile_path":"/2H8ucxG6LWAHCJAJf9OGfhSXpqQ.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Preacher","credit_id":"5b24b86b9251410d6c00307d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Maleczech","original_name":"Ruth Maleczech","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/iU9deeE41qiy3DGexVqPSJq78dH.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Sleepwalker","credit_id":"5b2872639251412c90001345","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garrett Bemer","original_name":"Garrett Bemer","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"5b287290c3a36847c00014b6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Facinelli","original_name":"Peter Facinelli","popularity":1.4521,"profile_path":"/mmha3A5INmromiCsN8FBSLScVpZ.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Lucifer","credit_id":"5b2872a20e0a2659be00148f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hynden Walch","original_name":"Hynden Walch","popularity":0.783,"profile_path":"/oFfZaFF1o724BuZ3cLK6tl9L03.jpg","cast_id":27,"character":"Darlene","credit_id":"5b2872b99251412c710014bf","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Stram","original_name":"Henry Stram","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/xyqrH8eYIyr0vwciioXn7SJoFFh.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"Man at Fair","credit_id":"5b2872cdc3a36847ce001295","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caitlin Hall","original_name":"Caitlin Hall","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":29,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"5b287318c3a36847c00014f0","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Conroy","original_name":"Francis Conroy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":30,"character":"Anne's Mother","credit_id":"5b2873329251412c6a001292","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Lyons III","original_name":"Gerard Lyons III","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":31,"character":"Anne's Father","credit_id":"5b2873449251412c6600107e","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodger L.
