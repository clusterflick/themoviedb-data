One person's disaster becomes another's boon, and vice versa--because a man loses his job, a young girl becomes the lead ballerina in the school play, which in turn causes the death of a pet pig. These characters weave around Los Angeles and each other as seemingly mundane events fall into place, putting them on a collision course with a common fate and one heroic act of competence.","popularity":1.9248,"poster_path":"/b87SvFpDBcOkhIH2LEtRg7Zj8cT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
