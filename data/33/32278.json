He feels as if he has woken from a dream, a dream lived in Vallecas, a working-class neighborhood in Madrid. His childhood is over. His mother and sister have dedicated their lives to him; now, although convinced of his innocence, they are powerless. His lawyer Marcelo - another son of El Barrio - is reluctant to take the case, happier to sever all ties with his secret past and a love long lost.","popularity":0.4517,"poster_path":"/5sjwMUXYXT60sR6FYiFCsqj5BID.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vía
