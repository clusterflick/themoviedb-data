Back in 1978 everything seemed possible. For Phillip and Guy, there was the thrill and exhilaration of first love. For their friends Devon, Jerry and Todd, life was still an open book with so many pages yet to be filled. Ten years later, his friends are all gone and Phillip is left alone to make sense of the joys and sorrows of his past life — as he looks hopefully to the future. The lives of two ordinary men who find love together only to lose it. In an era of easy sex and open relationships they have only two rules: Don't fall in love with others and no jealousy. Still rules are made to be broken. Eventually a single act of forgiveness restores their love.","popularity":0.8318,"poster_path":"/fdOFFFbUtxKpv2f4h7GoWC7NVRX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Plaid Shirt","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388232,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gregory Phelan","original_name":"Gregory Phelan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Philip","credit_id":"58e3e3bf92514128190215a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Spirtas","original_name":"Kevin Spirtas","popularity":0.2429,"profile_path":"/pjt3LJIii2wfv0hxvH9VYQFbujc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Guy","credit_id":"58e3e3c992514127f00230df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Israel","original_name":"Richard Israel","popularity":0.1281,"profile_path":"/feLa2jWt3ecLtoFvaAxYweGNl8G.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"52fe44d19251416c9101deed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Scott Lewis","original_name":"Russell Scott Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Devon","credit_id":"58e3e3f19251412835022235","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Klein","original_name":"Jonathan Klein","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/6ACJsncic2VwoUQhBUBjAlp830U.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Todd","credit_id":"52fe44d19251416c9101def5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":109182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal Jackson","original_name":"Crystal Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"52fe44d19251416c9101def1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Campisi","original_name":"Tony Campisi","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/qwuSCouwr9PVW7wOHbRdqOUbcDG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leon","credit_id":"52fe44d19251416c9101dee9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":170074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sierra Pecheur","original_name":"Sierra Pecheur","popularity":0.4327,"profile_path":"/jhuT4AQUFBLiChDb0Bw0nhGHZHr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5836054892514131950021be","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":109178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Natale","original_name":"Richard Natale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44d19251416c9101defb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":109178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Natale","original_name":"Richard Natale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44d19251416c9101dee5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116449","wikidata_id":"Q9276212","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mFAalgiBV3dezf01ehaLbhNfTy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fdOFFFbUtxKpv2f4h7GoWC7NVRX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1175,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9mVCwXriRHIIcN8VC87UiFYnQKB.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":786}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
