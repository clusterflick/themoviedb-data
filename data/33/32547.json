Less than twenty years later, the Argentinians have lost literally everything: major national companies have been sold well below value to foreign corporations; the proceeds of privatizations have been diverted into the pockets of corrupt officials; revised labour laws have taken away all rights from employees; in a country that is traditionally an important exporter of foodstuffs, malnutrition is widespread; millions of people are unemployed and sinking into poverty; and their savings have disappeared in a final banking collapse. The film highlights numerous political, financial, social and judicial aspects that mark out Argentina's road to ruin.","popularity":0.9346,"poster_path":"/g1RSkJbZsPzoaabp7VtCSi7lI9F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2901,"logo_path":null,"name":"ADR Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinesur","origin_country":""},{"id":8472,"logo_path":"/1W54BW7b0KZW0QoU55OPr9Sjde5.png","name":"Thelma Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":1245,"logo_path":"/suKdkPTtHn0DzGYmrXCA506dJON.png","name":"TSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":21990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Office Fédéral de la Culture","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":112137,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universidad Nacional de San Martín (UNSAM)","origin_country":""},{"id":113973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":47197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Sud","origin_country":""},{"id":10928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trigon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2004-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three decades of emptying","title":"Social Genocide","video":false,"vote_average":7.85,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"사회적 학살","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jagger","original_name":"Mick Jagger","popularity":0.6912,"profile_path":"/r1uFIYnBCDhIlqNbiTS4nDrjHrl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a6cf70e925141076900cadd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Richards","original_name":"Keith Richards","popularity":0.7344,"profile_path":"/t1oa5UsJMmrhNqCIks4jQnAYSQT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a6cf7160e0a265f07012915","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Wood","original_name":"Ronnie Wood","popularity":0.3169,"profile_path":"/x9cPzzqEOLIuvwsqfqoDTdXeeny.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a6cf7270e0a265f0d012197","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando E.
