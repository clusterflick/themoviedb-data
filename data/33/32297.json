He immediately attack couple. The bodies are found and then taken to a coroner's office, where the doctor does a thorough examination, not only discovering the girl has been completely drained dry but also that there are puncture wounds and traces of human saliva on her neck. He takes his findings to his police inspector friend. After another girl is attacked and killed in the same manner, the two men ponder whether the killer is a psycho who only fancies himself a vampire. Even more bloodless corpses turning up all over town and a funeral home reporting a coffin being stolen fail to convince them one way or another.","popularity":0.1405,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowley","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Islas","original_name":"Ricardo Islas","popularity":0.1842,"profile_path":"/arE7Fd7VWvCZVZIGeTtxSXHOQNK.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Crowley","credit_id":"5a43467bc3a36858e4047a32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Lacoste","original_name":"Daniel Lacoste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"","credit_id":"63f79a9f1f331900843b364c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Bertinat","original_name":"Fanny Bertinat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"","credit_id":"63f79ac446f35400812fe03b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Fernández","original_name":"Mario Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"","credit_id":"63f79b2bd1ca2a00f0099be2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935274,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Homero Ferreyra","original_name":"Homero Ferreyra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f79a0a68b1ea0082f62106","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Islas","original_name":"Ricardo Islas","popularity":0.1842,"profile_path":"/arE7Fd7VWvCZVZIGeTtxSXHOQNK.jpg","credit_id":"63f799edd1ca2a00f0099b6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Carlos Lazzarini","original_name":"Juan Carlos Lazzarini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f79a413d745400f0abdd73","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935275,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José del Cerro","original_name":"José del Cerro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f79a2669c70f0082220405","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Islas","original_name":"Ricardo Islas","popularity":0.1842,"profile_path":"/arE7Fd7VWvCZVZIGeTtxSXHOQNK.jpg","credit_id":"5a4346850e0a2620e0062504","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Islas","original_name":"Ricardo Islas","popularity":0.1842,"profile_path":"/arE7Fd7VWvCZVZIGeTtxSXHOQNK.jpg","credit_id":"5a43468a0e0a264fd2048599","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204228","wikidata_id":"Q24254504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crowley - Trailer","key":"XxNIhdhV5v0","published_at":"2009-12-07T17:25:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec690c3a36854480040c8"}]}}}
