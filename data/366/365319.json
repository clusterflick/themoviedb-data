When a young animal loses its voice and goes into hiding, the talking herd can’t accept its weakness and follows the rule, speaking to it using monologues. The young animal remains silent and the talking herd stands confused and unable to decide whether it’s really sick or just pretending. But as the silent, isolated animal struggles to get its voice back, the talking animals surround its cage and the most distrustful of them attacks.","popularity":0.2842,"poster_path":"/z9O7ZAfWqaW5qNISqUhPkwEYhMI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kika Georgiou","original_name":"Κίκα Γεωργίου","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/6pbwDu8aG8Exn1rNeRt04cWWtcd.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"562d1b8ac3a3681b4b007bc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1527057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Electra Nikolouzou","original_name":"Ηλέκτρα Νικολούζου","popularity":0.1051,"profile_path":"/wwmym03RlNXGke6rYHsY1R5BLm9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"562d1b9d9251412845007b14","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1262861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anneza Papadopoulou","original_name":"Ανέζα Παπαδοπούλου","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/bb1C5KxDGhsuqGJmB1ESPr5B8Rn.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66e83b253768a73f8d91dfe4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manos Vakousis","original_name":"Μάνος Βακούσης","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/uqxg8ZpNgz45vYTF6LSOpUONDVX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66e83a82050f14e4fcd00475","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omiros Poulakis","original_name":"Όμηρος Πουλάκης","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/yHtFroWOVEG2HXnrR8CaXnYCwr8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"562d1bb19251414ab70063c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1527059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioanna Mavrea","original_name":"Ιωάννα Μαυρέα","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":"/lfzIHErxfIepPotwkLN6ssFjT48.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"562d1bbac3a3681b5c0081d5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kostas Berikopoulos","original_name":"Κώστας Μπερικόπουλος","popularity":0.1672,"profile_path":"/qsvkb93qZnjCTHOT08H57IdcuYQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66e83b033768a73f8d91dfd7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgos Ziovas","original_name":"Γιώργος Ζιόβας","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/uT0bnbkNFhB2wqYfnaXyUlRw79n.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61719c706d4c97004484e15a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giorgos Gikapeppas","original_name":"Γιώργος Γκικαπέππας","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/8syuFqeY70LZuQoKgDRxhOC3dPC.jpg","credit_id":"562d1bf0c3a3681b590081a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giorgos Gikapeppas","original_name":"Γιώργος Γκικαπέππας","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/8syuFqeY70LZuQoKgDRxhOC3dPC.jpg","credit_id":"562d1bfd9251412853008877","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5667506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6mSoShBxxhHrRi9fpoeTIFnCoCh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1420},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4mAQy0N2YYGbbN1MSxaiM47ZstH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1407},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":795,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/faL7JKDuSd8TsokRfPR8ZLbXC0I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/z9O7ZAfWqaW5qNISqUhPkwEYhMI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
