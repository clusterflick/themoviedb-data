Requirement: they had to be one-minute artistic short films. The directors come from a whole range of different backgrounds, ranging from animated, experimental and short film to documentaries and feature films. The result is a multi-facetted sampler of diverse formal and contextual positions with regard to Mozart’s person and his influence on today’s society, art and culture.  The contributions run the gamut from experimental-conceptual statements through socio-critical and documentary observations to pithy short feature films.","popularity":0.3749,"poster_path":"/k0ndfQY0xFQcArRhPXbv3Oqqkkm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Mozartjahr 2006","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2006-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mozart Minute","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Wien Mozart 2006 - The Mozart Minute","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Spirit of Mozart - The Mozart Minute","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Beckermann","original_name":"Ruth Beckermann","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/pVck7C3W1ohYs0nsTvnSX1NZ9Ga.jpg","credit_id":"5c52d3959251410e0a634122","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolfgang Glück","original_name":"Wolfgang Glück","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c52d40ec3a3687564863933","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustav Deutsch","original_name":"Gustav Deutsch","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/9pzaVpdpls7NCoQePIeslxGEXt5.jpg","credit_id":"5c52d3e9c3a368478c9a5950","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Glawogger","original_name":"Michael Glawogger","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":"/bYkuAISIwtWAbOuFA8wnKiHhscE.jpg","credit_id":"5c52d402c3a368576a992e6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Gräftner","original_name":"Barbara Gräftner","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c52d41c9251410e0a6341ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Houchang Allahyari","original_name":"Houchang Allahyari","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c52d3c09251415e34623398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Hausner","original_name":"Jessica Hausner","popularity":0.2534,"profile_path":"/ZnNp71lxHD4lv5kB6i1pN6K58h.jpg","credit_id":"5c52d42b9251410e2463e228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrich Seidl","original_name":"Ulrich Seidl","popularity":0.3538,"profile_path":"/jvZeADVhGC5PytZlRmWqfEtls8f.jpg","credit_id":"5c52d3a6c3a36874b986b5ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siegfried A.
