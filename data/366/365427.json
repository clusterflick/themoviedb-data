The alleged disease is caused by the relentless heat that hits the city. Under the marginal eyes of Guima, in a mix of reality and fantasy, the film presents a tropical/chaotic Salvador, as opposed to the stereotypical city seen in postcards, on a journey of a search for a redemptive air conditioning that can rid this contemporary antihero of what suffocates his existence.","popularity":0.4769,"poster_path":"/5W3KgEKQkVmzUYgIUfZNyqa20L9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cavalo do Cão
