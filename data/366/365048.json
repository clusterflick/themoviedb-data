Consisting primarily of interviews with Chomsky and other writers, academics, philosophers, social commentators and broadcasters, this film explores the breadth, originality and importance of his work; and the alternative narratives he has advanced at some of the most critical periods in recent history.","popularity":0.8063,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noam Chomsky: Knowledge and Power","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Finkelstein","original_name":"Norman Finkelstein","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/nTqC7UnWoAVaeJBvD7HVUGaU9hM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"562a489f925141284a00238c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Edgley","original_name":"Alison Edgley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sJVSTzsk2xhxyydUrldYIoYu2p9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"562a4940c3a3681b4d00292e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Barsamian","original_name":"David Barsamian","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bkcRcdu8nbF2i2t9Ud8QAGl7RRM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"562a49a9c3a3681b6100248b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Massad","original_name":"Joseph Massad","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/evGWe8LLPpcZjc80ZkapxWwdB7U.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"562a49e1925141284a0023ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noam Chomsky","original_name":"Noam Chomsky","popularity":0.3033,"profile_path":"/yjpzdiWTGWZMf5RgHYtiJFojwaz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"574d57d3c3a36873e10011a7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Montaser Marai","original_name":"Montaser Marai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tOBKVrvA9amy0FheKtg6jITKxbr.jpg","credit_id":"562a4603c3a3681b4b001fe7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q123188769","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2052,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6kqeyXmbfZDS4kNm25c9WwVG7Qu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3648}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":209463,"name":"neo-colonialism"},{"id":220414,"name":"linguistics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Noam Chomsky: Knowledge and Power | Al Jazeera World","key":"_G0ILhcMGeI","published_at":"2015-10-15T09:40:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"562a4a5cc3a3681b610024a7"}]}}}
