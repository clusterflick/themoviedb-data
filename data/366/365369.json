The film follows a little girl with her doll who meets a neighbourhood boy with his tank; after her doll is damaged we are invited into a surreal dream where dolls rise up against the boy and their face resembles the little girl he hurt. The rebellion of the dolls signifies a rebellion against the boy’s malice and essentially against his refusal to be like a child. The dream yields fruit: on waking up, the boy, grateful to be alive, has joy restored in his heart and runs to makes amends with the little girl. The Rebelion of the Dolls renders the concept of rebellion as an internal event: an uprising of the conscience against the spirit of cruelty and disobedience and as a lesson to the little boy shows true conscience restored in the spirit of gentleness.","popularity":0.4476,"poster_path":"/lwviq06ssa78U3aDwsMAZqbgSjY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vardar Film","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rebelion of the Dolls","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Bunt na kuklite","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1493292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Ruben","original_name":"Emil Ruben","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/blWEcZUBSEkygOA4PANgzCinglR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"562d8ee7c3a3681b5c009217","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snežana Velkova","original_name":"Snežana Velkova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"562d8ef1c3a3681b5200910a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cvetanka Šulevska","original_name":"Cvetanka Šulevska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"562d8f5bc3a3681b52009126","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527222,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Miodrag Jovanović","original_name":"Miodrag Jovanović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"562d8f639251414ab70074ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandar Šukarev","original_name":"Aleksandar Šukarev","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"562d8f739251410a22004f63","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605601,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dragi Pankov","original_name":"Dragi Pankov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bc27de356a71147d6da169","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527215,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ljube Petkovski","original_name":"Ljube Petkovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bc27f4229ae22291cc6d97","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605600,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Vasilije Popović Cico","original_name":"Vasilije Popović Cico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bc2811a1a9ba009227e851","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ladislav Palfi","original_name":"Ladislav Palfi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bc2792097c49005148e409","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527215,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ljube Petkovski","original_name":"Ljube Petkovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562d8f18c3a3681b4d00a592","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitrie Osmanli","original_name":"Dimitrie Osmanli","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5636f8e29251414ab701a645","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0419613","wikidata_id":"Q31185483","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwviq06ssa78U3aDwsMAZqbgSjY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":596}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33630,"name":"doll"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
