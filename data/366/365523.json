The film begins in modern times, when a pair of Beethoven enthusiasts purchase the hair at a Sotheby's auction. The story then looks at the lock's previous owners and culminates in the science that reveals Beethoven's \"medical secret\". Set to a lush score of some of Beethoven's most glorious music, the film explores the world of forensic testing in sharp relief against the romance of 19th-century Vienna and the horrors of 20th-century Nazi Germany.","popularity":0.5288,"poster_path":"/ft4AQnSmvjd2CH51U44KXC5uD5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164,"logo_path":"/v3zcUepvKC7Vz36yjklk1rw6k8Q.png","name":"Rhombus Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":157741,"logo_path":"/2Ec5G6rTVSpXZB95v6rFlAfKiw4.png","name":"CBC Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":237849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Television and Cable Production Fund License Program (CTCPF)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven's Hair","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicky Guadagni","original_name":"Nicky Guadagni","popularity":0.5523,"profile_path":"/4hHivaWtgZMsMcYwDIX6b88hody.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"66d44f3c294f933dd901eef8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2337469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fletcher","original_name":"Michael Fletcher","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"66d44fa26417bf2a6f007042","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3628675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Cahill","original_name":"Matt Cahill","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"66d44ff438adc2a72c006e9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Guevara","original_name":"Alfredo Guevara","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"66d450334d35df9c44658b44","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Guevara","original_name":"Renée Guevara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"self","credit_id":"66d4504aa658ab22ebb62c01","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira F.
