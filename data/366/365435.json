She had once shot her husband with her daughter Julia's service weapon because he had slept with another woman. To the surprise of her probation officer and her daughter, she does not move into a new apartment in Rostock as planned, but returns to her home in Usedom in the \"Mörderhus\". Not only to the displeasure of her daughter, who has not yet been able to forgive her mother for what she did. Karin has to put up with derogatory looks and comments from the islanders. She herself sees Usedom as a second chance for her life and soon has a good connection to her environmentally conscious granddaughter Sophie, who supports her with legal tips during a protest. Karin also finds work in a bison enclosure, takes care of the animals and controls entry. Julia has to clear up the death of Thomas Krenzlin. The young paraplegic man is found drowned in the water.","popularity":0.4126,"poster_path":"/ccJzSEzyvZ9t46CCNW6NAzFrXcL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Usedom Thriller: Mörderhus","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Maria Potthoff","original_name":"Lisa Maria Potthoff","popularity":0.3458,"profile_path":"/zqWmKQPGj5ZIqWqg604yuImNrQ1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Julia Thiel","credit_id":"562e4f60c3a3681b4d00c51d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrin Sass","original_name":"Katrin Sass","popularity":0.5823,"profile_path":"/qvFBCUkcG9FKk9b7U9l6yFffDXp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karin Lossow","credit_id":"562e4f99c3a3681b5c00ae7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Bading","original_name":"Emma Bading","popularity":0.4372,"profile_path":"/7moZRs3HAe80zgeXh3Eh7KZBNhB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sophie Thiel","credit_id":"562e5020925141285300b545","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Borchardt","original_name":"Dirk Borchardt","popularity":0.3405,"profile_path":"/moV432gXKfuWtBxiScMUSYx9ySk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Heiner Krenzlin","credit_id":"56b5eb1f92514112b9007a9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Hopp","original_name":"Max Hopp","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/ahz012zd2ya1A2BQeFRGT72vIPC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Brunner","credit_id":"56d2f1bb9251413e6a00faf2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schneider","original_name":"Peter Schneider","popularity":0.3594,"profile_path":"/f8s0gmEMafI2drpv5bb3fomZVFh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stefan Thiel","credit_id":"5857212ac3a368315004d6b4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Herzog","original_name":"Andreas Herzog","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b5eafac3a36806f1008565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4665366","wikidata_id":"Q81232686","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lygwbyU50fQ6asvXKgpZYWYLKyh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ccJzSEzyvZ9t46CCNW6NAzFrXcL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"TV3","release_date":"2023-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
