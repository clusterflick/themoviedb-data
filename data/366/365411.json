Notable facts and characters of his songs takes us through the story, a portrait of São Paulo city in the 50's, a place full of music, love stories and gentrification (poor people getting evicted from their places in order to build great buildings), subjects often explored in Adoniran's work, always with a good touch of humor. This way he became the 'poor people poet'.","popularity":0.134,"poster_path":"/4u0daODBddHPt3hGHkREPFTgaIn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66416,"logo_path":"/bWSK7vS3AQI3JAakfmVysr1ag7I.png","name":"Latina
