The dangerous route has over 200 turns that need to be memorized beforehand.  Participation doesn’t hang on ability alone. It takes not only skills but also luck to get a spot on a team, not to mention cash to cover the expenses. The few tenners worth of gas vouchers won on Finnish circuits barely cover the ride back home to Imatra. Maybe the local chicken farmer would sponsor a familiar face? The road to the legendary race is bumpy.  The Fast of the Forest is a film about the daredevil world of road racing. It is also a story about perseverance. Quitting is not an option, even if the dream starts crumbling only moments before it is to become a reality.","popularity":0.3225,"poster_path":"/6KGQVQjDeOnD2WgCEOyKSvEgdHK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112481,"logo_path":"/iCSLFvjK6vxP2EUC7Y0paxXHar1.png","name":"ELO Film School Finland","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fast of the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juha Kallio","original_name":"Juha Kallio","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5da405eacb30840013932792","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"562e6072925141285700ad2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da40652afe2240018ed892d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2432106,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ville Katajala","original_name":"Ville Katajala","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da4065f1967570017ac1039","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182717,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alekos Vuskovic","original_name":"Alekos Vuskovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da4066dcb3084001393288a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da406791967570017ac106a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","original_name":"Antti Jääskeläinen","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da40682afe2240015ed4a69","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juho Nurmela","original_name":"Juho Nurmela","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da4068ecb308400169375e8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3778900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6KGQVQjDeOnD2WgCEOyKSvEgdHK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9571,"name":"motor sport"},{"id":10039,"name":"racing"},{"id":209979,"name":"isle of man"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
