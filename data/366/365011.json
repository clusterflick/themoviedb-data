North-Europeans are forced to migrate. Lucas, a middle-class man gets stranded in a coastal village in search of a passage to a brighter elsewhere. Through the difficulties and dilemmas he faces, BRAK explores how far the end justifies the means and how the price we are prepared to pay, can turn a sacrifice into betrayal. This debut fiction film by documentary filmmaker Laurent Van Lancker mixes contemporary realities with predictions of a possible nearby future. BRAK is based on a novel by Elvis Peeters and filmed on location in real settings (refugee camps and the abandoned city of Doel, Belgium).","popularity":0.2263,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fallow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Brak","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Louwyck","original_name":"Sam Louwyck","popularity":0.2118,"profile_path":"/lNBebf27sqh0FTYyyvikp77R197.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Drifter","credit_id":"5629f19892514140060000f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1128441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurora Marion","original_name":"Aurora Marion","popularity":0.1181,"profile_path":"/swPEBTdut6nKH4Zezc227WgWsmE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amina","credit_id":"5629f1ae925141284a0019ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tibo Vandenborre","original_name":"Tibo Vandenborre","popularity":0.2066,"profile_path":"/apFb2OmSFfrPQoBEU5M715NvSBp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lucas","credit_id":"5629f1c5c3a3681b59001888","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4831216","wikidata_id":"Q21160626","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer BRAK (Fallow) - Film Fest Gent 2015","key":"zEOLVSoY-TA","published_at":"2015-09-24T14:24:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5629f049c3a3681b5200197f"}]}}}
