Cuenca","overview":"In 2008, a corpse identified by the police with the birth certificate of the writer João Paulo Cuenca was found in an occupied building in Lapa. Inspired by this fact, the movie investigates the theft of the author´s identity in a ghostly Rio de Janeiro and in deep transformation. If in fiction and in crime sections of newspapers it’s common to read about people who steal the identity of someone dead to start a new life, what we have here is the opposite case: someone who steals the identity of a living man to die in his place.","popularity":0.2426,"poster_path":"/dajdUPAvWXqrbcdcXVej4JqqFs1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death of J.P.
