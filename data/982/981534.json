When he sings at a concert, they meet in Irene's room, take the printed program of the concert, and one of them plays the accompaniment of the song he is actually singing. Irene sees an advertisement for a maid and waitress at Madame Frangiapani's home. The wild thought enters her brain that if she applies and gets the position, she will be nearer her adored. She puts the plan into execution, gets the position, and is waiting for the signor to appear. He does appear in a towering rage, at an adverse criticism in a paper which he is holding in his hand. His wife tries to soothe him and treats him like a little, unreasonable, bad-tempered child.","popularity":0.201,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Irene's Infatuation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bunny","original_name":"John Bunny","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/jKA4iSzu1mCzPEP5U3kKBxJRpgt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frangiapani - a Famous Italian Singer","credit_id":"6293c09ff2cf250064e64444","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Walker","original_name":"Lillian Walker","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/tr17rGWaHdq5iWJFMh9vosynoG4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Irene, One of Frangiapani's Fans","credit_id":"6293c0b17d5db510a738415b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mme.
