Fifteen years later, Gavin Dishart, the Little Minister, receives an appointment, his first, at Thrums, Scotland. This was made possible through the self-sacrifices of his widowed mother, to educate him for the ministry. The community of Thrums is made up of weavers, who work hard, have little and accomplish much. They are ultra-religious and look upon their pastor with such reverence that he is a little lower than the angels. While naturally intelligent, they are grounded in dogma and intolerance. Just after the Little Minister takes charge of the \"Auld Licht Kirk\" and the Manse, the weavers resent a reduction, by the manufacturers, in their pay and a strike is declared.","popularity":1.4612,"poster_path":"/rFigaCbTWVOebk99xRDJTlww1Cu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Minister","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Kimball Young","original_name":"Clara Kimball Young","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/zMsyHsgLM1XuZyQlYPVeepATc5o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lady Babbie","credit_id":"6293d8a7a44d0900a9845650","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Young","original_name":"James Young","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/hUrgUlp8rBfn0WSKQcX6yzAEfym.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gavin Dishart, the Little Minister","credit_id":"6293d8b9cddbbc74b296b710","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jeanne - the Dishart's Servant","credit_id":"6293d91fa44d0900510b9754","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William V.
