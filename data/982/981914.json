Up to this, God's Own Country, came a man, Philip Weyman, to spend a year in that region. The man meets the woman and falls in love with her. He begs her to confide in him her great sorrow, which he sees she is constantly thinking of, but she tells him that she cannot do so.","popularity":0.1453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God's Country and the Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Duncan","original_name":"William Duncan","popularity":0.1934,"profile_path":"/w3uBUlApGHpPsNfkX2Qkwm4S5me.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Philip Weyman","credit_id":"6294e4f9f5483600506d04e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nell Shipman","original_name":"Nell Shipman","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/p1GSk1qe3Is3vx1PnyYxftPMilI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Josephine Adare","credit_id":"6294e50b5507e9009af391da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Holt","original_name":"George Holt","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Arnold Lang","credit_id":"6294e520df86a834e19438d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.H.
