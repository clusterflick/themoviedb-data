Manohar (Salvi, who plays this character’s earlier version: Bappa in Vinayak’s Amrit, 1941) is an alcoholic but idealistic public prosecutor and calls for the death sentence for the nationalist anarchist Ravindra (Vinayak). Ravindra’s girlfriend Shashi (Meenakshi) is pregnant and gives birth in an orphanage. She then becomes a nurse and has to look after Manohar who falls for her. She agrees to marry him but keeps her child a secret. When a child is found dead in the orphanage, Manohar prosecutes its humanitarian manager for infanticide. Shashi, who appears as a witness, reveals the truth of her life in court, causing a dramatic change in her husband’s world-view.","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":"/jNwYxPMz9AgOg1gEH6oalwDIi3m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maze Baal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Maze Baal","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Maza Baaal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1608033,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lata Mangeshkar","original_name":"Lata Mangeshkar","popularity":0.1701,"profile_path":"/m2wkjX5MfXbO43ujXMJ8rhHU4sA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62923d44cddbbc55055347e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3567295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinayak Karnataki","original_name":"Vinayak Karnataki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62923d987d5db510a523ad25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8517432","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNwYxPMz9AgOg1gEH6oalwDIi3m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mr","note":"","release_date":"1943-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
