It is a portrait of the tribe and a place where life is simple and time has another pace; but not after 2009 when the first road connecting this remote village to the populated lowlands was completed. The same year, cellular communication was extended to this area. Young Kelabits move to the cities to continue their education. Upon graduation, most do not return to the highlands since the agrarian economy does not provide many job opportunities.

This is not only brings changes to their lives when they become modernized like the rest of the world and the salt making tradition will surely come to an end.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weight of Salt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3569254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Bong","original_name":"Margaret Bong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62942ac391745b00a9a9a04e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
