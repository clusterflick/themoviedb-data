As they descend deeper down the rabbit hole, they find that maybe things are much more dangerous than they were led to believe. As things become stranger and dreams begin to cross into reality itself, Luke begins to see that his past, present and future factor into his final goal. In \"Nightwatch\", the world is not as simple as we have been led to believe. Where the brightest lights shine, inevitably darkness follows. But no matter how many steps into shadow you may take, the light can never truly go out.","popularity":0.0476,"poster_path":"/kaNHzUjagaLaYYalAPd0hJJ6OxI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightwatch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365987,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Colton-Hawkins","original_name":"George Colton-Hawkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6292ae8576eecf00652c7760","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2938292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanmay Srivastava","original_name":"Tanmay Srivastava","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6292ae233ff2df0096110968","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3567728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Newton","original_name":"Patrick Newton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6292ae2e70b4440050d15ab0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Metcalf","original_name":"Jake Metcalf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6292ae4109ed8f12547063b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365980,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zach Boynton","original_name":"Zach Boynton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6292ae4e209f1812c4b2a884","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14311528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kaNHzUjagaLaYYalAPd0hJJ6OxI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
