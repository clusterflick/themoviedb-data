It was about the use the modern spirit might make of the seventy five year old news from quantum physics, and for the first time made use of specially shot live action material back projected into the multi-plane image. In March 1998 at the National Film Theatre, Light of Uncertainty won Best Film at the Cutting Edge at the British Animation Awards. It was nominated for an award at Bradford Animation Festival in the category \"Professional\" and appeared at several prestigious International film festivals. It has appeared twice on BBC2; once on its own, and once as part of \"5 films by Clive Walley\" along with four of the previous series. It won Best Animation at Avanca, Portugal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light of Uncertainty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3569946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clive Walley","original_name":"Clive Walley","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pfQmoTpoFKfqybaqFMhDxYCTzFZ.jpg","credit_id":"6294c7d6a44d0900510e91f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
