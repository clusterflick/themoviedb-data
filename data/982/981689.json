In the main story, society girl Ruth Somers, a reincarnation of Serama, prepares to marry Cecil Brooke, the wealthiest man of her set. Her guardian, Dr. Norton, an incarnation of Lucifer, constantly accompanies her. Ruth is summoned to the Court of Conscience, where the witnesses, Lust, Avarice, Hate, Revenge and Vanity, testify about Ruth's history of seducing and abandoning men. This behavior resulted in the suicide of Madge, the lover of Ned Langley, whom Ruth enthralled and promised to marry, and also the deaths of two rivals for her love. Ruth is ordered back to earth to learn her sentence. When Ned interrupts the wedding, Ruth scorns him and he shoots himself. After Brooke leaves her, the Court dooms Ruth to live with the torment of remembrance. Ruth sends Norton away, and then kneels and repents.","popularity":0.2231,"poster_path":"/8OZa2pE8kQ5a8FhbfYMvWPTSZP3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conscience","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Brockwell","original_name":"Gladys Brockwell","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":"/jpo2C8eHFUrb451hWnfaPGqq5jh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Serama / Ruth Somers","credit_id":"629428b61e9225006411488a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Daw","original_name":"Marjorie Daw","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/2qRdFO7uZm5UQlh2kdaLGTYb5kO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Madge","credit_id":"629428be76eecf590e1d7550","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1253930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenie Forde","original_name":"Eugenie Forde","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/qSoVMe9x5dS2Wq0qA6gQDYxMvK1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Madge's Mother","credit_id":"629428c6fd630000663e322a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1050223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Southern","original_name":"Eve Southern","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/eypnLR2CAAuIRCNX21Dz6N5IHYZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Alice Marsh","credit_id":"629428ced48cee4e24b296e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Gerrard","original_name":"Douglas Gerrard","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/8B2FwROI0bmfKpcsWlv5WPpxywe.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Cecil Brooke","credit_id":"629428e0ab5e34004f413294","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Lonsdale","original_name":"Harry Lonsdale","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":"/xEq7ssiVJJAfsQk8gMgDclt79Cp.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Rupert Cowdray","credit_id":"629428f67d5db510a66cc6b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Chase","original_name":"Colin Chase","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/9EBO7SmfFxWBFo6QrnXM3QslI3o.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ned Langley","credit_id":"629428fd1e9225004f730c41","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Grassby","original_name":"Bertram Grassby","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/fmam6pfammNnEBWsYxCKnYdRv3P.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Dr. Norton / The Devil","credit_id":"6294290891745b00a9a995df","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genevieve Blinn","original_name":"Genevieve Blinn","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Marsh","credit_id":"629428d7a275020066f77f68","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Cecil","original_name":"Edward Cecil","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Alan Mackay","credit_id":"629428ec7d5db510a66cc687","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
