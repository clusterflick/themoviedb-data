The film shows how students get indoctrinated and how it impacts their lives. James and Elvyn's relationship has barely begun when politics begins to drive them apart. Evelyn has bonded with Maya, who believes it is the government's duty to help the less fortunate members of society. James, meanwhile, has joined a campus group led by Quentin, a conservative activist. Completely, filmed and produced in Centre County, Pennsylvania, Clash in the College covers a wide range of social and political issues, including abortion, immigration, government spending and education, while emphasizing finding middle ground where we can all agree.","popularity":0.2667,"poster_path":"/xDdUHv9KiqZneWT00xMc3ye6mXS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clash in the College","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riviera Abbott","original_name":"Riviera Abbott","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Evelyn Cox","credit_id":"6293bc4a1e9225004f70df4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2247479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel F.
