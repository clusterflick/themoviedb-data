What remains are mostly postcards containing images of some of the scenes. The earliest proof of this film dates from 1905, as it was shown in a Phono Chronomegaphone Theatre in Belgium(stating it had 5 acts and 8 tableaux). The captions of the postcards refer to lines taken from the opera libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré for the 1859 Opera by Charles Gounod(which again was loosely based on Goethe's play) which the film was based on.","popularity":0.0623,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1905-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","credit_id":"6294245a76eecf590d35ebde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1905-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
