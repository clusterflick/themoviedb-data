Enchanted with Jeanne's innocence, Forrest proposes to Jeanne, and they are married by an alderman friend of Forrest's with the license that Forrest had taken out with Helen. That night Forrest drinks too much, falls in his room and kills himself. The scandal appears in the papers, forcing Jeanne to confess the marriage to her sweetheart Robert Pitcairn. However, Helen, in an attempt to acquire the Chenoweth fortune, claims to be Forrest's widow, thus disgracing Jeanne.","popularity":0.1529,"poster_path":"/g5VOpuSUES86AKyjLGAgcCryEYN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Miss Leslie proves to be the prettiest little country girl who ever bobbed into the world's greatest city and picked out a millionaire husband and married him at midnight and lost him in an hour.","title":"The Midnight Bride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Marriage of Little Jeanne Sterling","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1487994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Leslie","original_name":"Gladys Leslie","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/hwVFhVpeOQZoY57viB2F2ziWjJY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jeanne Sterling","credit_id":"629401a8aa659e00680d2e53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morrison","original_name":"James Morrison","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/74FZiGds3xQqRB7Ee0WJLqMzee1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Robert Pitcairn - Jeanne's sweetheart","credit_id":"629401bf477215009b81146f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladden James","original_name":"Gladden James","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/uW1fpWXpEo2mLneq95yO004xQNs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Forrest Chenoweth","credit_id":"629401e0fd630000663d5813","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Applegate","original_name":"Roy Applegate","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/5IOBDJsWxhlJTmCvoaBIspm1gYb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"James Weir","credit_id":"6294020afd63000050e8d49e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":532628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Valli","original_name":"Virginia Valli","popularity":0.4259,"profile_path":"/6MUPusOIZUXkj1ADgWawHeZK5Kl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Helen Dorr","credit_id":"6294021e4bfa5400a8da9c1c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denton Vane","original_name":"Denton Vane","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/mOnA1U5PlLUk4HhrKwcE8NcIwcS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6294022a09ed8f125476753f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie Parker Spaulding","original_name":"Nellie Parker Spaulding","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Aunt Marcia","credit_id":"629401f4d48cee4e24b1b00f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Humphrey","original_name":"William Humphrey","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/j1UuxcTCQ48fBKjT6sU4iOuIwP1.jpg","credit_id":"629401590f21c60051dd9f38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424970,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Horace Hazeltine","original_name":"Horace Hazeltine","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62940166a27502009ad52358","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Taylor","original_name":"Sam Taylor","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":"/pY9U3YTrPTZY68YF75nszT9WX7G.jpg","credit_id":"629401894bfa5400676fe742","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0011461","wikidata_id":"Q54811344","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1260,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g5VOpuSUES86AKyjLGAgcCryEYN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
