The other members of his household are John, an old servant, Lucy the maid, and a half dozen more servants. John is smitten with Lacy. She doesn't take him seriously, owing to the difference in their ages. Mr. Walker, rather old and feeble, draws up his will and leaves the bulk of his property to Mary and Herbert. He bequeaths $5,000 to his faithful servant John. Herbert is very fond of his uncle. The old gentleman is very much attached to Mary and very desirous that she and Herbert should be wed at the proper time.","popularity":0.1208,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Pupil of His Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lambert Chase, Detective","credit_id":"629244c909ed8f1253482a8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John - the Butler","credit_id":"629244da5a4690009e45c2b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Tapley","original_name":"Rose Tapley","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/rwX3kI8L08zijmf8huOTzeW5QFt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lucy - the Housekeeper","credit_id":"629244ef76eecf0050952e9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James R.
