Hostile to outsiders, the Akha today are the living remnants of a former time, the bygone era of the Chinese Middle Empire. The Akha have a dangerously bad reputation: smuggling, destroying the forest, ignoring frontiers, growing opium. If they remain in the hills the Tha√Ø will eventually destroy them, if they accept to go down to the valleys they will surely die of disease. The Akha are running out of options.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Double Death - The Akha of the Golden Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3569252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Bourrillon","original_name":"Alain Bourrillon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629429bda44d0900a9865192","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
