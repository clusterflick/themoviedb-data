Above his own name is written the name of \"Norma,\" a daughter of Gyntsen, the aristocrat of the little village. Norma's father is a widower. He idolizes his daughter. Peter is a quiet, noble fellow, a fisherman, with the instincts of a poet and the rule of a king. He is not given to associating with his fellows, being of a retiring disposition. His natural timidity and shyness forbid him to make known his love for her and he worships her in silence.","popularity":0.2472,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Written in the Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Norma Gyntsen","credit_id":"6293c80ea44d0900a983f20f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Wilson","original_name":"Hal Wilson","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/o6v1TNGi5YqDeayaAB3UshIb8xF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bjornsen - the Minister","credit_id":"6293c81f1e9225004f711abb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gaillard","original_name":"Robert Gaillard","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/m5QWpQiBXRETL3ujyamQdykNkhh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Hansen","credit_id":"6293c832f2cf25009b8e445d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tefft Johnson","original_name":"Tefft Johnson","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/ioAvdqZHSTOSwZcVeNamE0BBAfl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gyntsen - Norma's Father","credit_id":"6293c8434bfa54005131c3d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Newburg","original_name":"Frank Newburg","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rowland - Bjornsen's Nephew","credit_id":"6293c8574bfa5400a8d97071","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles L.
