Levitan, then 14 years old, tracked Lennon to his hotel room at Toronto's King Edward Hotel after hearing a rumour that Lennon had been sighted at the Toronto Airport. Jerry made his way into John Lennon's suite and persuaded John to agree to an interview. The animation is based on Levitan's historic 30 minute recording of the interview, which was edited down to 5 minutes.","popularity":2.1395,"poster_path":"/j0pawYsvCvIMNRo6801H61ZvAOL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Met the Walrus","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f05899561bac400359c88b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Levitan","original_name":"Jerry Levitan","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/8gI7XXxRxAQinwsGewM4DLUNMBC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f0589c271458f0037cba37f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Raskin","original_name":"Josh Raskin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53bedb71c3a3684cf400367d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Raskin","original_name":"Josh Raskin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb4d61abeede36c446786e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Braithwaite","original_name":"James Braithwaite","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb4d8abf521f190f0a71c7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5264957,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alex Kurina","original_name":"Alex Kurina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb4db755dd812fad4682b5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Raskin","original_name":"Josh Raskin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67bb4dd3a4bf1c1928bee12a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1156511","wikidata_id":"Q1336357","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lGA9PvVKFjwhUl2YgFXw31BGCb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0pawYsvCvIMNRo6801H61ZvAOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
