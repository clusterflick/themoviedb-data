Drawing heavily on unbroadcast archive footage and the unique perspectives of the contributors, this is an exclusive account of Neil Armstrong's extraordinary life story. From his childhood during America's Great Depression to the heady days of the space programme, his historic first step on the Moon and his famously private later life. Seen through the eyes of those who were with him, the film explores the man behind the myth, a man who was very much a product of his time.  The film goes beyond his days as an astronaut and shows that his life after the flight of Apollo 11 was, in many ways equally challenging, as Armstrong came to terms with life outside NASA and the relentless demands of fame until his death in August 2012.","popularity":0.864,"poster_path":"/bHqMZR1rlEgENewFMC2XDalkAcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2015,"logo_path":"/2QYmUQEca7nlEmFkuvKQjKQsE0m.png","name":"DSP","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.","title":"First Man on the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Neil Armstrong: First Man on the Moon","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Neil Armstrong: First Man on the Moon","type":"TV"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Johnson","original_name":"Corey Johnson","popularity":0.4835,"profile_path":"/mhNbf4vGzixPL5mTIOBUPguqvpB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5bd5f9ab0e0a2622bf0321de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Armstrong","original_name":"Neil Armstrong","popularity":0.7052,"profile_path":"/qFvQ2fS9RTGnOgWIUGSWaB6qWsO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f1729","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Collins","original_name":"Michael Collins","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f172d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buzz Aldrin","original_name":"Buzz Aldrin","popularity":0.3272,"profile_path":"/gUuAUCEAR3ut3ZX1a5iiz5tegk0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f1735","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Scott","original_name":"Dave Scott","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f1739","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel West","original_name":"Samuel West","popularity":1.0188,"profile_path":"/bn1nd5zERi5wyHcA1YMGvrHAD5L.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Narrator (Voice UK)","credit_id":"63f14670a67254007de89690","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Copp","original_name":"Duncan Copp","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f1719","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Riley","original_name":"Christopher Riley","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f170d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141890,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Bowie","original_name":"Ben Bowie","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c259251416c910f1725","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Copp","original_name":"Duncan Copp","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ba3f9f0e0a2676bf00b173","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Riley","original_name":"Christopher Riley","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca59eec9251415eaf6c0c27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2625082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHqMZR1rlEgENewFMC2XDalkAcX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1265}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":305,"name":"moon"},{"id":1432,"name":"nasa"},{"id":14626,"name":"astronaut"},{"id":156836,"name":"space race"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"At least 2 versions made UK and US","release_date":"2012-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
