Desperate for some chow, they opt to impersonate a police officer and a baby, two types of diners most likely to get offered freebies. When that fails, they go to the food-chain source, posing as a cow. Yet more misadventures ensue before the duo finds itself chased by a latterday edition of producer Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. Director Del Lord was a former Keystone Kop who helmed many of the Three Stooges' most beloved comedies.","popularity":0.3013,"poster_path":"/t1EF9QzM8HihvvRoiRtuAH8tc7e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wandering Willies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bevan","original_name":"Billy Bevan","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":"/5yAbj9GLj7RfcMEFo3A20eOAIGU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Percy Nudge","credit_id":"52fe4c059251416c910ed1e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Clyde","original_name":"Andy Clyde","popularity":0.2349,"profile_path":"/a2HSCnMfIpLnLCNr6r4gWM8zR6K.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dusty Duncan","credit_id":"62221cdd41aac4006c748d11","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Hiatt","original_name":"Ruth Hiatt","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/86Vr473rt3xe4EIrfw71GmbKdCu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"62221ceb9f1be7006b8d2ae8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kewpie Morgan","original_name":"Kewpie Morgan","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/vev7Ak06wmKc4kx4Jpsjy5xVRUJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"'Rough' Rufus","credit_id":"62221cfac2823a006cdcdcbe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Dunn","original_name":"Bobby Dunn","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/awR4tammCTGhw6oVWnFGGKuAb0V.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Waiter","credit_id":"62221d0aeea34d001b16bc60","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Morris","original_name":"Dave Morris","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/zqmflOO85DJlk9afKuzWUUmZ9LK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cop","credit_id":"62221d1c42bf01004570cbb3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Taylor","original_name":"Ruth Taylor","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/iVefRbFoQo1EgeJ4ZgA7dOC1Yyt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nurse","credit_id":"62221d2b37b3a90019bc327b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion McDonald","original_name":"Marion McDonald","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":"/4tw1eqflXeSvfh6V9vvcWgVKdjF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Customer","credit_id":"62221d3beea34d001b16bd2f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gus Meins","original_name":"Gus Meins","popularity":0.2518,"profile_path":"/fYTlxmsvCnrA4uHycgxgZoTNTYr.jpg","credit_id":"62221cbbc2823a0042179841","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Del Lord","original_name":"Del Lord","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/zGGlVrOKtnNXn9yxKMYkGY1yBMg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c059251416c910ed1df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017525","wikidata_id":"Q117637518","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t1EF9QzM8HihvvRoiRtuAH8tc7e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1491,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1qMZr5j6OjN1raedJRzCCeZKOqk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
