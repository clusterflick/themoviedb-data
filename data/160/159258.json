Settled in a kind of subjective amnesia, Dirceu tries to bury his family's past. He is a demolition man in Recife, an urban landscape undergoing an uncontrolled process of transformation. Maria shares the same country origins, but she uses the city for a different purpose. She is a carefree and joyful music student. If Dirceu aspires to a world that is stable and present, Maria lives in discord with the present. To her, nothing is as it should be. Maria's apparition unleashes in Dirceu an urge for being somebody else. On a route of escape through the desert of the backlands, a unique encounter is set to happen. Boa sorte, meu amor (Good luck, sweetheart) is an anti-romance of the impact between music and silence.","popularity":0.2933,"poster_path":"/m00nGbgsKfbjooJw4o3oY7W5o07.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orquestra
