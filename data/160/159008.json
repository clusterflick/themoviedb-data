U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich tries to raise awareness of the country's widening economic gap. He publicly argued about the issue for decades, and producing a film of his viewpoints was a \"final frontier\" for him. In addition to being a social issue documentary, Inequality for All is also partially a biopic regarding Reich's early life and his time as Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton's presidency. Warren Buffett and Nick Hanauer, two entrepreneurs and investors in the top 1%, are interviewed in the film, supporting Reich's belief in an economy that benefits all citizens, including those of the middle and lower classes.","popularity":3.3821,"poster_path":"/yGWDqQlRzIcvna4YoEYw1cZ7rmn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25844,"logo_path":null,"name":"72 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inequality for All","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":115,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Økonomi i ubalanse","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"모두를 위한 불평등","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Reich","original_name":"Robert Reich","popularity":0.2262,"profile_path":"/f9Pbe4ULNEzrKeNZKn2GWJZ4mE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c009251416c910ec5b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolly Parton","original_name":"Dolly Parton","popularity":0.9422,"profile_path":"/uLFZgrfSqAxLj3UM7dkTPdlCKkc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doralee Rhodes (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a91439c3a3687495005b56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyne Daly","original_name":"Tyne Daly","popularity":0.881,"profile_path":"/uR0nx2bniih1Kdhst5R3LH59smk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mary Beth Lacey (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a91453c3a368707a00587a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Tomlin","original_name":"Lily Tomlin","popularity":0.9626,"profile_path":"/eoFMSqRykiaXMGCiz7Kxehfqy1W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Violet Newstead (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a9146bc3a3687a4300675f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Tyler Moore","original_name":"Mary Tyler Moore","popularity":0.4909,"profile_path":"/v4tIqWFbCcvqLrFhhHbeelR5f1l.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Richards (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a914a0c3a368707a005882","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candice Bergen","original_name":"Candice Bergen","popularity":1.2901,"profile_path":"/nElAkiKaYlO039KgvWVZAC1fHTk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Murphy Brown (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a914b1c3a3687a34006708","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Stewart","original_name":"Jon Stewart","popularity":0.7163,"profile_path":"/jmnRMhkms5YAHNb5ZK5ro750vKk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a914d9c3a3687a2b006ca1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Gless","original_name":"Sharon Gless","popularity":0.5513,"profile_path":"/wcdGF6h6pTqUky9emO1DTNBzeRG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Christine Cagney (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a914f8c3a3687a310067d6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conan O'Brien","original_name":"Conan O'Brien","popularity":1.1628,"profile_path":"/deRbViPut0t80miscBpP2DhBJU5.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a91509c3a3687a3400670c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barack Obama","original_name":"Barack Obama","popularity":1.0798,"profile_path":"/reEkbvLlNknpCo2I37Vim6XpqGu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a91518c3a3687a310067da","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":216674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hillary Clinton","original_name":"Hillary Clinton","popularity":0.6621,"profile_path":"/67D6LJgwfbF0baKknUx6OPIoVlu.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a91525c3a3687a310067dd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Clinton","original_name":"Bill Clinton","popularity":0.5146,"profile_path":"/aOSAwUHkTYdcVrl5MdOzuGRluTm.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"53a91533c3a3687a400066f6","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George H.
