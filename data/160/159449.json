The images include women spinning on cotton wheels, families making traditional tteok (rice cakes), a look at Dongsomun (Seoulâ€™s ancient East Gate), which was destroyed just years later, and missionary activities in what is now North Korean territory.  The footage was once stored in a German monastery, but later the Nazi government, which sided with Japan in World War II, tried to confiscate it because some of it could be interpreted as espousing a critical view toward the Japanese occupational regime in Korea. Fortunately, a monk saved the film, hiding it behind a stone wall in the basement before he died during the war. The film was rediscovered in 1975 during a renovation.","popularity":0.1011,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Lande der Morgenstille","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"In the Land of Morning Calm","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Weber","original_name":"Norbert Weber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c119251416c910eebc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2443716","wikidata_id":"Q124556345","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
