The artist removes his eye; it falls from his hand, seeing images spin as it rolls. A man falls, objects in the studio falls on him, he's not the artist. A woman gets help from a man in a lab coat; he and the man on the floor fight over a shotgun. Outside, in the city, people and cars move backwards. On the street, those from the studio chase a woman who's stolen leeks. In the backward cityscape, they move forward. They run toward a seaside amusement park. The artist follows, his head in a bird cage. He ends up with the woman who went for help; or does he?","popularity":0.0719,"poster_path":"/jL0H87XK73tSPNts8M2rBmPJXtg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cage","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Peterson","original_name":"Sidney Peterson","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/htc1ElPYnb8V5JGUfXT5BBh11DZ.jpg","credit_id":"5355a5c80e0a2628680001a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hy Hirsh","original_name":"Hy Hirsh","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9a1b4590cf51002559de46","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1440309","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jL0H87XK73tSPNts8M2rBmPJXtg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"San Francisco Museum of Art","release_date":"1947-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
