They included frequent jazz-rock collaborator Ernie Watt, and David Benoit, master of a \"jazz-lite\" style. But guitarist Lee Ritenour is key man here: he calls most of the shots, and six of the eight pieces are his, including a fine tribute to early inspiration Wes Montgomery on \"24th Street Blues.\" For the most part, easy-going and mellow are the watchwords on this program - not surprising since the players tend to be based in Los Angeles. Ritenour's \"Etude\" stands out for its creation of atmosphere, and so do Dave Valentin's solo melodic meanderings on a selection of wooden flutes backed by his own vocal effects. All elements considered the bill is a demonstration of top-drawer musicianship, awareness of contemporary styles â€“ and versatility.","popularity":0.2601,"poster_path":"/rNBpE1capru0iNGO4YnuraOYkBO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Music","title":"Lee Ritenour with special guests - Live in Montreal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ritenour","original_name":"Lee Ritenour","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/5icR0fSuVRWpaOCnw3KvQsvME5t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"54fafdb5c3a368690e0011d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":197815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Benoit","original_name":"David Benoit","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"54fb01279251417bb80014af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Grusin","original_name":"Don Grusin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"54fb0140c3a368199b0018ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Watts","original_name":"Ernie Watts","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tenor Saxophone","credit_id":"54fb01699251413aa000177a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Valentin","original_name":"Dave Valentin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Flute","credit_id":"54fb01ae9251413aac001900","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abraham Laboriel","original_name":"Abraham Laboriel","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/rNpYz38EBlqwKmaqEHs0Go6JM6f.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"54fb01d89251417b700013f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Novak","original_name":"Gary Novak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"54fb0200c3a368696a0013d6","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vpRqOIVxg86Egv5fCWwTHPFRplO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1145,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rNBpE1capru0iNGO4YnuraOYkBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
