Every sport has its ultimate prize. The hole in one, the trophy, or just making it through the finish line In the sport of snowmobiling, there are as many different styles of riding as there are riders. The flatlander might be happy with a freshly groomed trail, a racer is always looking for the fastest time, and the hillclimber is eyeing that next big chute. For us boondockers though, the ultimate reward is deep powder in the most challenging terrain, or as we like to call it, First Tracks. Join us as we travel through the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada in search of first tracks and new riding locations. Experience the highs and lows of the season, the successes and gut-wrenching failures, and of course the ridiculous deep powder days","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boondockers 7","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
