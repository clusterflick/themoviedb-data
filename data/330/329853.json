Throughout the world, Christians are being threatened, beaten, raped and killed simply for being believers. And yet, the American church remains inactive and largely unaware of their sufferings. Christian persecution has been a reality for more than 2,000 years. While tragic, it is not a story of defeat. Instead, those who find themselves in the crosshairs of violence today count it a blessing to stand among the faithful throughout history. In the face of persecution, these followers of Christ fear compromise more than death itself. Love Costs Every Thing maps the history of Christian persecution from the first martyrs to seven present-day stories of faith that knows no price","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Costs Every Thing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
