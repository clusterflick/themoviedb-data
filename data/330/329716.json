After two marriages (one ending in divorce, the other with her husband's death) and two children, the free-spirited Angie has returned to Jean-Francois, only to announce after a year of living together that she's leaving him to open a antique business in the United States. Jean-Francois regrets Angie's decision, but also knows her well enough to know there's little he can do to change her mind. Five years later, Jean-Francois has become friends with Angie's daughter Winnie, who now lives in Paris and has fallen in love with Laurent, a carefree artist who lives in a studio given to him by his father. However, after sleeping with Laurent, Winnie is convinced he can't be trusted and keeps him at a distance. Over the next few years, Laurent keeps running into Winnie, and Angie periodically arrives at Jean-Francois' doorstep only to leave again shortly after.","popularity":0.4041,"poster_path":"/7KktC2fPmDFOiPUSF2W8HHhZgmC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11773,"logo_path":"/8fCjsqh43LbPV6pm3SfR5Jx64GU.png","name":"Artémis
