Her ex-husband Richard also sees that and therefore advises her to finally find a new partner. And at a vernissage, she meets a young and handsome Japanese man called Gen and falls head over heels in love with him. Also, Gen does not seem averse to a relationship. What Rike does not know is that Gene's heart belongs to his friend Thomas. In Rike, the homosexual young man sees the suitable marriage candidate to secure his stay in Germany. When Richard announces his  wedding with his new girlfriend, Rike does not want to be inferior. Thomas, however, sees the fictitious marriage, which he himself has invented, with increasing jealousy: an angry fight over Gen's affection ensues between him and Rike, by all means and without regard for losses.","popularity":0.2339,"poster_path":"/1rDGZ8Pl7BBemiRHCsbmegqBdP7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ehespiele","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ute Willing","original_name":"Ute Willing","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/xCpfDC3DclfLmY58AqNRwsPvOcL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rike Schr√∂dter","credit_id":"54fd9100c3a368699800713a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miroslav Nemec","original_name":"Miroslav Nemec","popularity":0.2424,"profile_path":"/zkQXcfEZNXyheZIpx0koSG8cNxC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Xaver","credit_id":"54fd911e9251412204004ae9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisela Trowe","original_name":"Gisela Trowe","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/up1LoTMTtRrfnTjOzZmYGHmvyBM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54fd9129c3a3684711004b3d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annett Renneberg","original_name":"Annett Renneberg","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/oQZt2e5XEI9CvCui3KGyrf0YR8z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54fd913492514123a0004e05","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Terpoorten","original_name":"Siegfried Terpoorten","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/xDnlQ65ZA8TiEAp7BjPnN0ZDU84.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"577ae8519251415b0000099e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Maria Kurz","original_name":"Eva-Maria Kurz","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/2thaISJshF3uR6hW9o8SRK1GKgK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kuratorin Coco","credit_id":"577ae865c3a36824330009e1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrizia Moresco","original_name":"Patrizia Moresco","popularity":0.2061,"profile_path":"/wXuRnfOdrrdSGuOuzYvlgHanLfT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Katrin Schrader","credit_id":"5a653ccbc3a3687f9802c094","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Garde","original_name":"Claudia Garde","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fd90c99251416c32000f00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0373811","wikidata_id":"Q60887678","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":967,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1rDGZ8Pl7BBemiRHCsbmegqBdP7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
