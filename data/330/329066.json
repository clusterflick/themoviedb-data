His perception shifts into another dimension: a dark, hallucinatory place. Driven by a mysterious power and desperately in search of his loved ones, his soul passes by the everyday reality of many castaway refugees at the border of the alleged paradise, Europe. The old man's spirit observes people on the street being chased away like dogs, follows an illegal worker and a drug-addicted mother and slips inside crowded refugee shelters. Wandering through this limbo, the old man questions the meaning of his existence.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":34574,"logo_path":"/sKFIZJUuctmEgDJngtIXMPjaRZ9.png","name":"BALDR","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Tigrinya","iso_639_1":"ti","name":""},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Feel the Fire Burning","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Knibbe","original_name":"Morgan Knibbe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f971ec9251414392001163","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Knibbe","original_name":"Morgan Knibbe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f9720ac3a36878d2001277","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182706,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xander Nijsten","original_name":"Xander Nijsten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f97225c3a3683c55000ea2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katja Draaijer","original_name":"Katja Draaijer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f97240c3a36878d200127c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Hoeve","original_name":"Frank Hoeve","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f9724d9251416fab000e94","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4119052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Those Who Feel The Fire Burning","key":"RG9numrMUZ0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-11-02T10:49:45.000Z","id":"638bd1557d5db50fb78bde69"}]}}}
