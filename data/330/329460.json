She recalls her early childhood in Germany and her association with such legendary directors as F.W. Murnau and Fritz Lang. Leaving Germany for Paris in 1933, her anticipation of WW II saw her relocating to the South of France. Eisner gives her considerable and insightful opinions on classic German Expressionist Films, as several of her admirers drop by during the interview conducted by director Sohrab Shadid-Saless.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":"/p98pp2SQE0YnBDz1iBIqRAPzMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Vacation of Lotte H.
