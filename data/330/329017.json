This is the first section, which covers the pianist’s “French period” from roughly 1920-1939, and it details, among other things, his connection with Jean Cocteau (who, as a matter of fact, contributes voice work to this project). Filtered through gonzo and impressionistic puppetry (often bearing strong resemblance to the work of Terry Gilliam), the film takes an unconventional and often beautiful stab at the television biography special.","popularity":0.2187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Koninck Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Igor Stravinsky: The Paris Years Chez Pleyel 1920-1929","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Igor: The Paris Years","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexei Jawdokimov","original_name":"Alexei Jawdokimov","popularity":0.1224,"profile_path":"/28XD73rAITIFWc2gVCgQeg507HF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Igor Federovich Stravinsky","credit_id":"54f8dcb2c3a36843f500002a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milos Kirek","original_name":"Milos Kirek","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/7NkxkRfXvUmOjOq8PEO9MRJEZDf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vladimir Mayakovski","credit_id":"54f8dcc392514118fc000050","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1435428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Rosol","original_name":"Jan Rosol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jean Cocteau","credit_id":"54f8dccdc3a36843ef000030","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","credit_id":"54f8dc70c3a36843ef000027","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410871,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larry Sider","original_name":"Larry Sider","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f8dc9892514118f300002a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","credit_id":"54f8dc7a92514118f3000026","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"54f8dc8d92514118f3000028","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274058,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Martin","original_name":"Colin Martin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f8dca392514118fc000043","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0086375","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Igor: The Paris Years [1982] (Brothers Quay)","key":"EPMIZmEaTiY","published_at":"2011-09-29T10:21:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"54f8dc1c92514118ee00001e"}]}}}
