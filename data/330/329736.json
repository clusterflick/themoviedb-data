The film contains reworked footage from Aleksey Batalov's \"Overcoat\", Eisenstein´s \"Strike\", Petrov's \"Peter The First\", Tikhomirov's \"The Queen Of Spades\" and others. Petersburg is an unbounded visual fantasy where reality and imagination merge into one. The history of the city represented in a digital form may live its independent life. Yevteyeva presents sights of St.Petersburg that have become the genetic code of the Russian culture in a particular manner in her film. Each shot of the film was hand-painted with special strokes.","popularity":0.2005,"poster_path":"/bPpacgah6PJETD9zSoacw0JmtlN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170208,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2003-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petersburg","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"ПЕТРБУРГ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Cherednik","original_name":"Александр Чередник","popularity":0.0476,"profile_path":"/3SBuD357zRvv0XrD4azLtQS4qLF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dee5529dc86470019c58676","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Evteeva","original_name":"Ирина Евтеева","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/bPJTfHwrRR1LhmyChQ65DSg1jan.jpg","credit_id":"54fe10339251410e51000092","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Evteeva","original_name":"Ирина Евтеева","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/bPJTfHwrRR1LhmyChQ65DSg1jan.jpg","credit_id":"64cb3ef6297338020a88346c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Chernykh","original_name":"Andrei Chernykh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cb3f02764b990100894fa3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4194959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yuriy Kravtsov","original_name":"Yuriy Kravtsov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cb3f0f706e56014ec3ff9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0372464","wikidata_id":"Q4360172","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bPpacgah6PJETD9zSoacw0JmtlN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
