Google Earth satellite images plunge us into the heart of the action: a gloomy square surrounded by soulless buildings, and the interior of an aristocratic residence.  Witches are no more a part of Tcherniakov’s Macbeth that the duel was of Onegin, but once again the atmosphere is one of brooding claustrophobia.  Tcherniakov has chosen a great cast, beginning with the marvellous Lithuanian soprano Violeta Urmana as Lady Macbeth. Greek baritone Dimitris Tiliakos is a powerful presence as Macbeth, while the Italians Ferruccio Furlanetto (bass) and Stefano Secco (tenor) are sumptuous as, respectively, Banquo and Macduff.  In this, his second production at the Paris Opera, Teodor Currentzis, music director of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre conducts with verve and a splendid theatrical sense.","popularity":0.2275,"poster_path":"/qbpH3HbBePkUvNIL4Syhng2XDRY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir
