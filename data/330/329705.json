A young woman, Linda, comes to retreive a suitcase belonging to Sébastien, her companion and Mikael's friend. It contains hundreds of photographs from all over the world. While he is travelling, Sébastien has asked Linda to organise the photographs with a view to an exhibition. Mikael invites Linda to reside with him. She accepts. That is the heart of the film – an intertwining of photographs which, juxtaposed by Linda, begin to speak. In parallel with this, Linda receives cassette-letters from Sébastien. A subtle relationship is established between Linda, the young debutante, and Mikael, the man of experience. Mikael goes off to direct his psalm, Linda stays alone. The walls become covered with photographs – wall of happiness, wall of misery – the fight between Good and Evil. Linda learns of the accidental death of Sébastien and stays alone.","popularity":0.1961,"poster_path":"/5olHXJUOMf4e4uMamCKOcWgptYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cauri Films","origin_country":""},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Facing Us","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lonsdale","original_name":"Michael Lonsdale","popularity":0.5007,"profile_path":"/lQZktsBj1CFbIEIpXOZp55kCiB5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mikaël","credit_id":"54fdef9392514112be0001b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":272988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentine Vidal","original_name":"Valentine Vidal","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/hkv03ZKHQ6zXWFThnF0V95oIib.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"54fdef9bc3a36878c90001ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Beigel","original_name":"Alain Beigel","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/eMfZGItXcEXwADStfMxlN5Lp3N2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sébastien","credit_id":"54fdefa492514112b7000222","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Négret","original_name":"François Négret","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/eX9JSG8RHAhFf8d1CMn3yeJMvrW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5f42c16f99d5c30035b6adce","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","original_name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/3eoJoSIgbEG7NbQjs6rk7a6BAQU.jpg","credit_id":"54fdef30c3a36878bc0001fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437364,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laurent Roth","original_name":"Laurent Roth","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fdef4492514112c4000200","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","original_name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/3eoJoSIgbEG7NbQjs6rk7a6BAQU.jpg","credit_id":"54fdef3992514112cc000186","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112003,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Acácio de Almeida","original_name":"Acácio de Almeida","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/yB1mU5Sj7CYKOtXTstMQ8MwWMx8.jpg","credit_id":"577ed88dc3a36849770016a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646899,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie-Claude Reverdin","original_name":"Marie-Claude Reverdin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577ed877c3a368694a003268","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646900,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Françoise Geissler","original_name":"Françoise Geissler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577ed89892514132970058ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646901,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Guirado","original_name":"Jean-Paul Guirado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577ed89fc3a36849e4001517","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Duhamel","original_name":"Antoine Duhamel","popularity":0.0548,"profile_path":"/hvVxYwaaU0TxUCzqh1O3X0HMT3g.jpg","credit_id":"577ed887c3a368497700169d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0294438","wikidata_id":"Q21008123","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5olHXJUOMf4e4uMamCKOcWgptYO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
