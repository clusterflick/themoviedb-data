On December 27, 1968, France and Algeria signed an agreement which admitted each year 35,000 Algerian workers to French territory in the France of the Trente Glorieuses where the annual growth rate reached 5% and where factories lacked workers. Candidates obtain a residence permit valid for 5 years for themselves and their families. Paris is committed to improving professional training and housing conditions for immigrants, too often confined to the most thankless jobs and often housed in slums. A testimony on the living conditions of emigrant workers \"economic cannon fodder\" of neocolonialism which simultaneously develops its alter ego, institutionalized racism, as a tool of social stagnation and division of the proletarian class.","popularity":0.3771,"poster_path":"/sCAKz2GkEyAOvJYzMbTemCYvad8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221064,"logo_path":"/6Du6SZMGJkiVRuRG5iJipd9oGjJ.png","name":"Amicale des Algériens en Europe","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1974-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Finger in the Works","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Rachedi","original_name":"Ahmed Rachedi","popularity":0.1919,"profile_path":"/yQ4r1onbBDb5MhMMhNwFRpfHnCY.jpg","credit_id":"54fc141ec3a36847110017f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568158,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rachid Boudjedra","original_name":"Rachid Boudjedra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5U651vC4mPKM9Bgz9QPRLL6bl10.jpg","credit_id":"65d0b8102dda890162dccbce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7295370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sCAKz2GkEyAOvJYzMbTemCYvad8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":237543,"name":"proletariat"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":298955,"name":"algerian diaspora"},{"id":320948,"name":"maghreb immigration"},{"id":321108,"name":"poor workers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
