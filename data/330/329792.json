The couple, now in their mid-thirties, became heroin addicts in the turbulent years of upheaval in Russia. They know their days are numbered, and pit their frail zest for life and gallows humor against this fact. The film draws on these moments and offers an intimate portrayal of a fragile and ambivalent love affair.","popularity":0.1441,"poster_path":"/opsIRtRVqgTFOceNSA8WTrzGwB2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2014-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When It Blinds, Open Your Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Когда слепит, открой глаза","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivette Löcker","original_name":"Ivette Löcker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5Ylaf95SjAaWaYdsVzANPqjMfyA.jpg","credit_id":"54fecd2892514177f20010d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivette Löcker","original_name":"Ivette Löcker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5Ylaf95SjAaWaYdsVzANPqjMfyA.jpg","credit_id":"54fecd36c3a368150c0012a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44664,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frank Amann","original_name":"Frank Amann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fecd4dc3a368150c0012a4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564797,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Palm","original_name":"Michael Palm","popularity":0.1664,"profile_path":"/C4xAof0LLUfbsF0Q5cM86F4gUD.jpg","credit_id":"54fecd579251410e54001489","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3588212","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/opsIRtRVqgTFOceNSA8WTrzGwB2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
