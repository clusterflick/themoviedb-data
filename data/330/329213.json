Using still photographs, found objects and unsettling creations that briefly come to life via stop-motion animation (which evokes the work of the Brothers Quay and gives them an even more unreal presence), filmmaker David Lowery tells a phantasmagorical story, part fantastical mystery and part nightmare, as a primal memory. A CATALOG OF ANTICIPATIONS weaves imagination and experience into a haunting tale recalled in snapshots of recollection, a dark fantasy with a tactile texture that grounds it in the physical world and narration that frames it as a coming-of-age moment. - Sean Axmaker","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Road Dog Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Catalog of Anticipations","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3175747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Margaret Lowery","original_name":"Mary Margaret Lowery","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"61011cc21684f7005f0dc29b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3183411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cammi Heath","original_name":"Cammi Heath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"(narrator)","credit_id":"610734967719d700456db591","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Curtis Heath","original_name":"Curtis Heath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61013410a84a4700462c5f1e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lowery","original_name":"David Lowery","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/86QPrv9y0Ienk6sqPmxz7HYqkJf.jpg","credit_id":"610734b3f10a1a002e3c9395","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lowery","original_name":"David Lowery","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/86QPrv9y0Ienk6sqPmxz7HYqkJf.jpg","credit_id":"54fa0c56c3a36811c9000201","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1161406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
