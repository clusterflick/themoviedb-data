I. N. A. had commissioned me to produce a personal vision of the Festival d'Avignon. This became a fiction about the theater because if I had filmed the actual performances at Avignon I would have had to respect their staging, I would not be able to change anything. As such, I wouldn't be doing anything more than a retransmission of Antenne 2 or FR3. And since a lot would have to be paid for rights to each play, it would end up costing as much as a fiction feature. So it is a story about the theater, a bit Rivette-ish. I shot all the exteriors in Avignon, the interiors in Paris a few days later and I finish the film next Tuesday.\"","popularity":0.4096,"poster_path":"/dCOk0Db60awPc4Q4umkYvphlEHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Presence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franck Oger","original_name":"Franck Oger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Adam Shaft","credit_id":"6613428ae10f4601a438df0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadège Clair","original_name":"Nadège Clair","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/tsrRgh9oDif7vFwlM9mqKOBfOZs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6613429c9408ec01492a043b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Mora-Scheihing","original_name":"Camila Mora-Scheihing","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661342aa0bb07601852fbf52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Oudin","original_name":"Catherine Oudin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67bee46054589cd857561bc6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Castel","original_name":"Louis Castel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67bee4a3c3f8c5a804efb9ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2206297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Loup Rivière","original_name":"Jean-Loup Rivière","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67bee4e1d727e5fa90efb60c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Rist","original_name":"Christian Rist","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67bee54bf9755fe09d561f98","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"54fe10fd9251410e560000c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0089849","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A3R3INdISRZp5PKq1uYsk9X41jr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krNBxRICKaHJ5Od6NC6kvwg7z44.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZoRFtNaIHIJbHOUb3ccyFCCEj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dCOk0Db60awPc4Q4umkYvphlEHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8VgwZqclxkFvCptLvjRm6BDTLUB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
