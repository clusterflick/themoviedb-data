Wild fish populations from California to Alaska have been declining since the late 1970's. Coincidentally, the open net fish farm industry began to grow fish in marine waters at the same time. Fish farms were seen as a way to offset growing pressure on wild stocks. But one woman, Alexandra Morton, noticed diseases coming from fish farms were killing wild salmon. Film maker Scott Renyard links the crash of many fish species on Canada's coast to diseases spread from fish farms and the loss in marine fish biomass has global implications.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pristine Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3783694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
