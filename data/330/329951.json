At this point, Filfil enlists the services of a witch, Umm ul-Hiba, who transforms Filfila into a chimpanzee, while supplying Filfil with an antidote to her magic, which will return Filfila to her normal self. Although this initially proves successful, the witch is soon afterwards found dead --- and with her death, Filfila turns back into a chimp! The rest of the movie consists of Filfil and Filfila's quest to restore her human form, comprising visits to conjurers, soothsayers, alchemists, and others.","popularity":0.1646,"poster_path":"/A7gfsprcLW1Ik0qzmKo0eM4RAT3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Filfila","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","title":"Mughamarat Filfila","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvina Amine","original_name":"Melvina Amine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55001cf1925141275c000d5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Franke","original_name":"Ursula Franke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55001d03c3a3685b9e001272","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shafiq Hassan","original_name":"Shafiq Hassan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wNu04buNYAIfN7eH3h8TX0wUIVw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55001d0ec3a3685bab0012c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ibrahim Khan","original_name":"Ibrahim Khan","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":"/u2ncrOLlMHfDJMuF9ZRWbVmRBEt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55001d18925141282f000c23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1838010,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sayed ElMaghriby","original_name":"Sayed ElMaghriby","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":"/bFqxcCF9oUi6Dk7m6voan02xJPW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67217104974a676c6df33448","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Agrama","original_name":"Frank Agrama","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/rYG5UsmkXOd48csNUTMcomL9smF.jpg","credit_id":"55001d2b9251413da80013c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4185218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7gfsprcLW1Ik0qzmKo0eM4RAT3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":593}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
