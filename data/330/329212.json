MY DAILY ROUTINE is a playful visual diary of filmmaker David Lowery's days, from waking in the morning to turning in at night, when his racing mind refuses to let him sleep without working over a new creative project or reading until the wee hours. It is also about the frustrations of creative work and the lure of distraction as a self-employed filmmaker and editor-for-hire in a plugged-in world. Narrated by the filmmaker and illustrated in hand-drawn sketches, it plays out like a mock slide-show (complete with the projector hum and click of changing images) by way of a tutorial. \"I made MY DAILY ROUTINE at a point where I was just really frustrated with where I was and I wasn't even making things,\" explains Lowery. \"There was a lot of red tape I was trying to cut through with other projects, but I really wanted to make something. This film is what I wound up making.\" - Sean Axmaker","popularity":0.1387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Daily Routine","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lowery","original_name":"David Lowery","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/86QPrv9y0Ienk6sqPmxz7HYqkJf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(narrator)","credit_id":"61087ea3f706de005e087f8b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lowery","original_name":"David Lowery","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/86QPrv9y0Ienk6sqPmxz7HYqkJf.jpg","credit_id":"54fa0b669251414a1d0001a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lowery","original_name":"David Lowery","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/86QPrv9y0Ienk6sqPmxz7HYqkJf.jpg","credit_id":"5c4852e692514154484e25d2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2235653","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
