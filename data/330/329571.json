Following in the footsteps of the award-winning The Joy of Stats and its sequel, Tails You Win - The Science of Chance, The Joy of Logic takes viewers on a new Wingspan roller-coaster ride through philosophy, maths, science and technology all of which, under the bonnet, run on logic. Wielding the same wit and wisdom, animation and gleeful nerdery as its predecessors, this film journeys from Aristotle to Alice in Wonderland, Sci-Fi to Supercomputers to tell the fascinating story of the quest for certainty and the fundamentals of sound reasoning itself.","popularity":0.3207,"poster_path":"/6lDsk59jQRD2FBpY1GBGXUubpCv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":80495,"logo_path":"/ye7zbHuFbYDmMinkGX3GLXnbGZn.png","name":"Wingspan Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Joy of Logic","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Cliff","original_name":"Dave Cliff","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"570939dd92514155f3000244","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603336,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Gale","original_name":"Catherine Gale","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57093ac292514144710003d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010025,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Archie Baron","original_name":"Archie Baron","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57093af19251415bc7003a57","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603336,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Gale","original_name":"Catherine Gale","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57093aa792514155f300026c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3545434","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9MZqYt4VDwHzk4OMGfdB6eRqEMs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6lDsk59jQRD2FBpY1GBGXUubpCv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o0FVL75kkQ77Bkpt1fVEEEyOLBY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6009,"name":"mathematics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
