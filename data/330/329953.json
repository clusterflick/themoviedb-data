Suor Angelica tells the story of the nun Angelicaâ€™s familial loss, sacrifice and suicide.  Gianni Schicchi is an opera full of trickery, greed and romance as a family dispute breaks out over a missing will.  The Olivier-nominated Royal Opera production featuring a trio of one-act Puccini operas was first performed together on the same bill at Covent Garden in September 2011, and was acclaimed by the Telegraph as \"an operatic treat... three hours of gorgeous music that allows big voices to let emotion rip\" and by the Evening Standard as \"a triumphant vindication of the social awareness and dramatic power of Puccini's triptych\".  The trio of operas offers a panorama of emotions, with the dark and foreboding Il tabarro and comic Gianni Schicchi bookending a heart-wrenching Suor Angelica.","popularity":0.6132,"poster_path":"/rQ2VPSWTXOB2UQ28hH3l2QfMKcC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Puccini's Il Trittico:Il Tabarro, Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi - from the Royal Opera 2011 performances","title":"Puccini: Il Trittico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucio Gallo","original_name":"Lucio Gallo","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/bzNRGXoJT6vRUGOQ0hJ9H4dRncx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Michele/Gianni Schicchi","credit_id":"550026f3c3a3685b96001403","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Maria Westbroek","original_name":"Eva-Maria Westbroek","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/zZUpfmddyLN6sUSSDgeKeAgOX6Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giorgetta","credit_id":"55002714c3a3685b96001406","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandrs Antonenko","original_name":"Aleksandrs Antonenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/en4KNbSDmU9Rhu7uey7GEOALOz0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luigi","credit_id":"55002743c3a3685b96001409","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermonela Jaho","original_name":"Ermonela Jaho","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/5cXV7EMRi2AUwMNM4KiBuwDib7m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sister Angelica","credit_id":"55002756c3a36826b9000103","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Larsson","original_name":"Anna Larsson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/n9dfUFXy8ueImIFwEzRH1WozWlc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Princess","credit_id":"55002766925141282f000cd2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Demuro","original_name":"Francesco Demuro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/s3Hx5MaGA02CHE7oN7ikPfJOZF0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rinuccio","credit_id":"5500277ac3a3685b96001412","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Siurina","original_name":"Ekaterina Siurina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lauretta","credit_id":"55002789c3a3685bab00138b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff950f3a0be28003f8c6b02","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","original_name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff950f9a0be28003f8c6b19","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550027c8c3a3685b9600141e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2669053,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"D.M.
