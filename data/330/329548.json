It's the day before his first solo concert, where he is going to play Bach. While he strolls around the city he is thinking, not so much about the concert as about himself, both as a lonely foreigner and as a human being in cosmos. Here and there he encounters some racist comments, but mostly he just feels the weight of social exclusion because of his otherness, especially when it comes to women. On the morning of the day for his concert the embassy informs him that his whole family has perished. He feels totally broken, although he thinks that everyone holds some pain inside. His piano teacher, a professor at the Academy, looks him up, and tells him that he heard what has happened. The professor advises him to communicate his feelings that evening by using his Bach.","popularity":0.1569,"poster_path":"/juRDrcM1uIF7McUEuFKcFrj1vgc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123934,"logo_path":null,"name":"FAMU","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fugue on the Black Keys","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1935288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Dìaz","original_name":"Julian Dìaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fati Farari","credit_id":"5a25effec3a3680b960e43a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404404,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jiří Stivín","original_name":"Jiří Stivín","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/3LpdvGwDefXeMDamIR5B1uMFoBU.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b6aa7caa4700476de5e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"František Rauch","original_name":"František Rauch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b6b0223a8b004aee2706","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3487386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ladislav Zajíc","original_name":"Ladislav Zajíc","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b6dbf48b34005b5acb3b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1845748,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jiří Štíbr","original_name":"Jiří Štíbr","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b6f3f263ba005c269d1f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milan Jonáš","original_name":"Milan Jonáš","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b7027caa47008ad79f99","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2614694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonín Novotný","original_name":"Antonín Novotný","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b735960cde0049031d39","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alena Bradáčová","original_name":"Alena Bradáčová","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b73bf48b3400942fc04d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2479564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaroslav Horký","original_name":"Jaroslav Horký","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b741470ead00475cd93d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Savas Christofi","original_name":"Savas Christofi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"","credit_id":"6245b74781140f005ce3cd26","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.
