We follow Thich Nhat Hanh around the time of Memorial Day of 9/11 in Washington D.C., where he teaches Members of Congress the concepts of ‘Mindful Living’. He tries to convey his message of peace straight to the centre of world power.  Thousands of people participate each year in the meditation retreats led by Thich Nhat Hanh. In his monastic community Plum Village in the south of France, his home base, he brings groups of Palestinians and Israelis together. Horrible experiences are exchanged and discussed for the first time, in the hope that people may come to recognize each other’s suffering.","popularity":0.2827,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life Is My Message","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437449,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martijn van Haalen","original_name":"Martijn van Haalen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fe1530c3a36810980000b2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Schouten","original_name":"George Schouten","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fe14f2c3a368109a0000e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437447,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marina Bodbijl","original_name":"Marina Bodbijl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fe150c9251410e4b0000f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437448,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernd Wouthuysen","original_name":"Bernd Wouthuysen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fe1518c3a368108f0000cd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":345,"name":"monk"},{"id":6172,"name":"zen"},{"id":210956,"name":"zen teacher"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
