So he spent a couple of months walking and interviewing folks along the Camino de Santiago in Spain and France in the spring of 2013. Hilarity and Culture ensue in \"Wayfaring - A Jaunt along the Camino de Santiago\". You'll meet...Monique, a New York sophisticate trying to lose her cynicism...Thrice-timer Eddie from Ireland who constantly waxes philosophic about the Camino....Brandon from Texas who finds himself skeptical of those who divulge their alleged reasons for walking The Way. Also, semi-crazed eatery owner Pilar whose on-camera rants are priceless. This is Herriott's seventh film involving long-distance treks and those he encounters along the way. It's characterized by his wry humor, good eye with the camera and occasional whining.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wayfaring - A Jaunt along the Camino de Santiago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
