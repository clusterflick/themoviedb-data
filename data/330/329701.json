Nina has scored a plumb assignment, an interview with Tach (Jean Yanne), a well-known but reculsive novelist who rarely speaks to the press. After he passes along his less-than-charitable views about women (including the belief they should be killed in childhood, before they start to menstruate), Nina concludes the interview, but soon finds herself interrogated by police when Tach is found dead and she is the key suspect.","popularity":0.3103,"poster_path":"/7MmlkI8fynqozhSFvysRhdybTCW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hygiène de l'assassin","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Yanne","original_name":"Jean Yanne","popularity":0.2846,"profile_path":"/nZAsOM0mtE0oHHj9DlbH94SxtAI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Prétextat Tach","credit_id":"54fde8de92514112be000121","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Schulz","original_name":"Barbara Schulz","popularity":0.3333,"profile_path":"/w0vEnFq3NQrMWC9rlgDs8A3H9cz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nina de Kerlec","credit_id":"54fde8e7c3a36878b600015a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Broustal","original_name":"Sophie Broustal","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/v3snHMZpPlfO33cPe36o4uGScSC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Papillon","credit_id":"54fde8f292514112c400017c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Hiegel","original_name":"Catherine Hiegel","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/pcbGRRllIm5vaVjrPgpW0Fyq3TL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"54fde8fb92514112be000124","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Prat","original_name":"Eric Prat","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":"/8nVzOmL7ZI6dUrApvGvBUTvpGmh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"'Le Pain'","credit_id":"54fde906c3a36878c0000151","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gotainer","original_name":"Richard Gotainer","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/9h8UpCXkIIsEq8WvKgkyGQ1wOFY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"'La Brosse'","credit_id":"54fde90f92514112c4000189","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone D'Aillencourt","original_name":"Simone D'Aillencourt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The nurse / Léopoldine of St Planeze","credit_id":"54fde91cc3a36878bc000171","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agathe de La Boulaye","original_name":"Agathe de La Boulaye","popularity":0.3119,"profile_path":"/gC0Pri8cUQnAtrCNQ8slVF6ecHi.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"The psychologist","credit_id":"54fde92792514112bc000199","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420282,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amélie Nothomb","original_name":"Amélie Nothomb","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/t82KHJKux6KQ6VShMRs6iBhBlGO.jpg","credit_id":"54fde89cc3a36878cc000111","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":66078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"François Ruggieri","original_name":"François Ruggieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fde88e92514112c200013f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":66078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"François Ruggieri","original_name":"François Ruggieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fde8c492514112b9000155","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0187165","wikidata_id":"Q19544798","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7MmlkI8fynqozhSFvysRhdybTCW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1301}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
