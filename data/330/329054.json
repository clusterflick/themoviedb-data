Yannick Bellon’s captivating postmodernist film, as much a study of evanescence as any poem by Dickinson, segues into the film that Colette, a few years before her end, has just said she doesn’t want to do. Giving voice(over) to her own commentary, she goes back, first, to the home in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, Yonne, where she was born.","popularity":0.1523,"poster_path":"/3tJsK5BVYqqd6ldZpMUqqivdxGT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colette","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Colette","original_name":"Colette","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/9mUDMO0y03gBqMbN8ieqTujDUzb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54f94b25c3a3687f8b000c0d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannick Bellon","original_name":"Yannick Bellon","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/okuMgkfxLzzdEDSaufo8KGh5sqB.jpg","credit_id":"54f94b1a925141439f000cea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0306665","wikidata_id":"Q48747316","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3tJsK5BVYqqd6ldZpMUqqivdxGT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
