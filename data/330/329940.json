Mr. Walesa was subjected to frequent firings and intense police scrutiny. But he was undeterred, continuing his fight for fairer labor laws — in particular, the right to strike — until it grew into something even he could not have expected: an independent political movement that became one of the nails in the coffin of the Soviet Union.","popularity":0.1403,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lech Walesa: The Shipyard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Errol Morris","original_name":"Errol Morris","popularity":0.2081,"profile_path":"/p0OVTOHWNOaEfK8eUjvey6uEbRp.jpg","credit_id":"54fffaa2c3a3685ba600125f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5960442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
