They are arranging for the gradual smuggling of components into Iran to build a small nuclear weapon, for which they use eleven mules, each carrying a different part. The plan is that one week before the International Atomic Energy Agency is to inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities, they will detonate the bomb near a famous sports stadium in Tehran in order to cause mayhem and mass destruction and discredit the Iranian government. Written and directed by Behrouz Afkhami, from a story that is loosely based on the novel The Fourth Protocol by Frederick Forsyth.","popularity":0.2029,"poster_path":"/nHjI3rRtK6iKeJWsyrHDJxpf4xC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mahab Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day of the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Day of the Devil","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Rooz-e Sheytan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Dehkordi","original_name":"Ali Dehkordi","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/owR01igdbLjDUPZeIuA9pzAOFi1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54fb56979251417b70001bd5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atila Pesyani","original_name":"Atila Pesyani","popularity":0.3405,"profile_path":"/obv0DhLaERko4CG5aqe5FyiC1OQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54fb56a0c3a3686998001d5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1592098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdolreza Akbari","original_name":"Abdolreza Akbari","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/kbyt1pnfoD3oVxt0bwP4SBjWhz1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1d45ee0e0a264cc406195a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5225521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masoomeh Karimi","original_name":"Masoomeh Karimi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67a268578a76c1102c260fd1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39948,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Forsyth","original_name":"Frederick Forsyth","popularity":0.5382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54fb56d09251413aac002164","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Behruz Afkhami","original_name":"Behruz Afkhami","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/xDEWBZA6MWDX40fcLNrVs3w0M28.jpg","credit_id":"5d0567f30e0a261fbbd675fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Behruz Afkhami","original_name":"Behruz Afkhami","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/xDEWBZA6MWDX40fcLNrVs3w0M28.jpg","credit_id":"5d05680092514117b4be1b7f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1151393","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nHjI3rRtK6iKeJWsyrHDJxpf4xC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
