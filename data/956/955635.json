He is talking with his sweetheart, Jane Dinsmore, as Alice Robinson, Jane's intimate friend, enters with a letter from an erstwhile associate, advising her to go to New York and accept a place in the chorus. A word from Temple, and Alice has made up her mind. She leaves for New York. Temple and Jane have been married some time and are living unhappily, apart from the old folks. The former's reputation as a heavy actor is wide, but drink has degraded him. Subsequently, Jane dies, due to Temple's abuse of her.","popularity":0.4249,"poster_path":"/oWoxo2uFUD21ptV8YIxEi2tmxlp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through Turbulent Waters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude McCoy","original_name":"Gertrude McCoy","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/tneqF59Pgj02UajLvI7mENYjIFu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alice Robinson","credit_id":"62420ff5706e56005dc7fd9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Farrington","original_name":"Frank Farrington","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/1DNd9Suja5C7cXgANZepMFFilLx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Paul Temple","credit_id":"62421004f85958008c307b89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Learn","original_name":"Bessie Learn","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/h9GKlmNco5iOF8nYZB7h1Fcx6h3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jane Dinsmore","credit_id":"6242101341a561005c6c1584","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Strickland","original_name":"Helen Strickland","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jane's Mother","credit_id":"6242103adfe31d00929b559f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2533304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan McRae","original_name":"Duncan McRae","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jane's Father","credit_id":"6242104c9451e7005e751f1c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":565358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Dwight","original_name":"Mabel Dwight","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jane's Aunt","credit_id":"6242105d706e56008bd970b2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Brower","original_name":"Robert Brower","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/qvBIggdZwbGjNcPoRlQeT3IF1j1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"James Montrose","credit_id":"6242106e706e56005dc7fed2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Earle","original_name":"Edward Earle","popularity":0.3087,"profile_path":"/mybd58aGD8RYdfjObAcbdgx4og2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Frank Wentworth","credit_id":"62421084c50ad20047f92171","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Ellison","original_name":"Marjorie Ellison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Leading Woman","credit_id":"62421098fea0d700895df28b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxine Brown","original_name":"Maxine Brown","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"A Maid","credit_id":"624210aa1cfe3a005cf231c6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank McGlynn Sr.","original_name":"Frank McGlynn Sr.","popularity":0.1811,"profile_path":"/rVmcxe3urwZmHhtRjAtRS5AQhyK.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Bill Ford","credit_id":"624210bdd71fb400883eafe0","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2533304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan McRae","original_name":"Duncan McRae","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62420fce7caa47008acbfbd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude McCoy","original_name":"Gertrude McCoy","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/tneqF59Pgj02UajLvI7mENYjIFu.jpg","credit_id":"62420fe5c50ad2005cd73082","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006159","wikidata_id":"Q21183936","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1432,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oWoxo2uFUD21ptV8YIxEi2tmxlp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":954}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9249,"name":"backstage"},{"id":9748,"name":"revenge"},{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
