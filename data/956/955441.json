This film is about growing up in an exile community in the West, developing a double-identity, and becoming a hyphenated-somebody. It’s about learning to have two homelands at the same time - one in real life, and the other imagined and maintained by parents who were forced to flee. It is about a first generation of children whose parents lived abroad longer than they originally expected to, and who never really assimilated.  The story is told through an unlikely, albeit dramatic reunion – one which involves a Hungarian rock opera performed in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California by a cast of 40-something Hungarian-Americans. The original cast, including the film's director, meet in the exact same spot they performed Stephen, the king 25 years ago, as Hungarian scouts during summer camp in 1984.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wPqd9vIFs1kNPquYc75RV4BjA6t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incubator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Réka Pigniczky","original_name":"Réka Pigniczky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624167ef0f36550096638cb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1729650","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2820,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/wPqd9vIFs1kNPquYc75RV4BjA6t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
