A total of 992 Aircraft were built with productions finishing in 1999. As well as the three main operators, Tornado's were also bought by RSAF (Royal Saudi Air Force) and are still in service, now. For many years Tornado crews were trained at the Tri-national unit at RAF Cottesmore, but when this unit was disbanded RAF training was moved to RAF Lossiemouth with number XV (reserve) Squadron, who still operate Tornado GR4's today. One RAF Squadron still operates the F-3 air defence version, being 111 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in Scotland.\r All other Aircraft are based at RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Marham with GR4's.","popularity":0.0965,"poster_path":"/2fQYZWdwqNgUzo0RxNQ62feC7BF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Panavia Tornado","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483170,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Oliver","original_name":"Nick Oliver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624139549451e7008c921bea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Garofalo","original_name":"Robert Garofalo","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bALY1FrqhjMtAaldxMd4frVzz33.jpg","credit_id":"624139d6706e56004817901c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Garofalo","original_name":"Robert Garofalo","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bALY1FrqhjMtAaldxMd4frVzz33.jpg","credit_id":"624139baf85958008c2e3dc3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyn Beardsall","original_name":"Lyn Beardsall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624139a91cfe3a00876fb9e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483171,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Wilding","original_name":"Simon Wilding","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241396c45765d0047d851f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":917,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaTYqDvPZ9quclX2XE2TlveuMct.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1631}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1341,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2fQYZWdwqNgUzo0RxNQ62feC7BF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":894}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
