One day a well-known Hollywood actor walks into their shop and asks if they can make a plaster replica of his penis. When he later brings a friend of his, also a well-known actor, in to get his 'member' replicated, the girls hatch an ingenious plan to make a lot of money by making replicas of stars' penises, then blackmailing them.
