About its civilian and armed struggle against South African occupation and economic oppression. Historical footage depicts the mechanics of colonialism, earlier resistance struggles, and the origins of the current situation. The film has caused a stir internationally. The footage is unique (occasionally smuggled Super-8 film). For instance the film includes a sequence that revealed a South African massacre of 105 people in a Namibian village (the filmmakers have testified before the UN about their experiences).
