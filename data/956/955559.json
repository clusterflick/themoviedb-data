With an unbelievable bounty on his head, his next target is a serial killer called \"The Reaper\". But when he finally confronts the Reaper, he is immortal and does not die, even with a windpipe in his chest, while the gunman is cornered and on the verge of disaster. With the help of his friends, he manages to turn the tables and blows up the 'Reaper' with dynamite, but the 'Reaper' still does not die. As a last resort, the gunfighter delivers a desperate blow that somehow ends the Reaper's life. The gunman then leaves without a trace.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tchJDV9VhS5mgNQjAb2T0T1bJ1I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KILLER, ADIOS！","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryuji Hideshima","original_name":"Ryuji Hideshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d35e9451e7005e745170","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryuji Hideshima","original_name":"Ryuji Hideshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d3733e09f30087c12f18","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryuji Hideshima","original_name":"Ryuji Hideshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d388f859580049038fa6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryuji Hideshima","original_name":"Ryuji Hideshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d381c50ad2005cd63a51","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryuji Hideshima","original_name":"Ryuji Hideshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d37a1cfe3a005cf15e56","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryuji Hideshima","original_name":"Ryuji Hideshima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d3690f365500966487e0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tchJDV9VhS5mgNQjAb2T0T1bJ1I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
