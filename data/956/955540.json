This is the situation that most people today find themselves in, but this film depicts the tragedy that is caused by people who are eighteen there, in many different ways. There, victims can also become perpetrators, and perpetrators can instantly become victims, and this is clearly conveyed in the film, which is probably one of the main reasons for the use of middle-aged and older people as heavily weighted performers, which is unusual for an independently produced film.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/y38HxgYngKAavUxIDHftaepHffl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"昼下がり","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shiratoriza","original_name":"Shiratoriza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6241cb9a97a4e600876103f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daishi
