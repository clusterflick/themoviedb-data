This episode is about the four pilgrims who are led into a high-key sunbeam. The drones and Mevrevic riff in three different folk flutes (Quena, Shinobue, Suling) are intoxicated under the interference of the fluorescences, still, the four continue with their pilgrimage.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zEjD1MszwPSHcBTLsrdqDvo9UR4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mystic Tube #2: Number of Fluorescents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2444380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuri Obitani","original_name":"Yuri Obitani","popularity":0.0799,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62420d642cde9800865a341d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zEjD1MszwPSHcBTLsrdqDvo9UR4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
