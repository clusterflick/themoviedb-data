Due to their child-like small vocabulary, today's young people seem to have poor communication from an adult's perspective. However, they know how to feel happiness in their ordinary daily lives and how to share it. The film depicts the theme that happiness is not something to be searched for, but something to be felt, in a soft narrative like a girls' manga, within the three days of four women.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/kJjxdlL0hQrtq6g71Qhg0JHaCMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ウワバミの絵","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenji Omae","original_name":"Kenji Omae","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c4e2c740d9005d76d3e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kohei Yamada","original_name":"Kohei Yamada","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c4ebd71fb400883dad2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shusuke Muramoto","original_name":"Shusuke Muramoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c4f4706e56004818addd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giki Okawa","original_name":"Giki Okawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c4fd1cfe3a004771796f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanta Umezawa","original_name":"Kanta Umezawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c5042cde980047e0d9ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2376883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eriko Yoshida","original_name":"Eriko Yoshida","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c5127caa470047623c6a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mika Mori","original_name":"Mika Mori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c51a3e09f30087c0fa5c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wakako Higuchi","original_name":"Wakako Higuchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c52397a4e60047a43694","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayuko Yamashita","original_name":"Mayuko Yamashita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6241c52a0f3655009664562c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayuko Yamashita","original_name":"Mayuko Yamashita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241c48d2cde980047e0d82f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayuko Yamashita","original_name":"Mayuko Yamashita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241c4940f3655005ff787e8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayuko Yamashita","original_name":"Mayuko Yamashita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241c49f97a4e6005bd78d07","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483546,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kentaro Iwakiri","original_name":"Kentaro Iwakiri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241c4bb706e56005dc700f4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827554,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shigeki Akiyama","original_name":"Shigeki Akiyama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241c4caf859580049035e44","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483547,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kei Fujiki","original_name":"Kei Fujiki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241c4d4c740d90047a859bc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJjxdlL0hQrtq6g71Qhg0JHaCMJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
