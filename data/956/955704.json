Shinza has enticed Chushichi, the Shirakoya clerk, to aid him in kidnapping Okuma, daughter of the Shirakoya's owner. Shinza sent back Yatagoro Genshichi, the gang leader who came to negotiate with him, but the landlord Chobe who comes to see Shinza is more than Shinza can cope with, and Shinza decides to release Okuma in exchange for 30 ryo in cash. But Chobe talks Shinza down and cheats him out of 15 ryo and half of a large bonito. Later, Genshichi ambushes Shinza and kills him to avenge the humiliation he suffered because of Shinza. Usually this work is performed from the 'Shirakoya misesaki' scene in which Shinza persuades Chushichi to join his plot, to the 'Fukagawa emmadobashi' scene in which Genshichi takes his revenge on Shinza.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/ks93jJu199JaHUTkGgMfGRIWege.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11376,"logo_path":"/lrglrxyGOMRl9KCsmcjmzjjpT2H.png","name":"NHK Enterprises","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masterpieces of Kabuki Theater: Shinza the Barber","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3484643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamasaburo Bando V","original_name":"Tamasaburo Bando V","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6242e88f706e5600481c3567","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3484644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomijuro Nakamura V","original_name":"Tomijuro Nakamura V","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6242e8b497a4e6008764b993","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3429058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shikan Nakamura VII","original_name":"Shikan Nakamura VII","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6242e8d0c740d9005d7b176d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nakamura Kanzaburo","original_name":"十八代目中村勘三郎","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/hlZRm3BeHI1WLrZJXOG6oCHYUWq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6242e9117caa47004765dd67","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mokuami Kawatake","original_name":"河竹黙阿弥","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6242e80b9451e7008c975961","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ks93jJu199JaHUTkGgMfGRIWege.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
