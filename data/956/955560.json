A girl cannot accept the death of her lover. An angel is right next to these people who are struggling to survive, almost crushed by a love that has nowhere to go. A plastic bottle delivery man. A guide to the passage between this world and the next. A rebirth witness. And a folk duo called the Vaudeville Duo. They deliver their miracles as unobtrusively, as small and shiny as a grain of light in the midwinter wind. What miracles are performed by angels in human form, riding around on bicycles, holding fishing rods or endlessly shirking?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7Geq6y47mAKQKWU04LnNyCBXBI2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welome, Back, Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideaki Toya","original_name":"Hideaki Toya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6241d44bc50ad2005cd63e12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sachiko Okura","original_name":"Sachiko Okura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6241d451f85958004903932e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3239502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Kawamoto","original_name":"Takashi Kawamoto","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d42e0f3655004a0ee0ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3239502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Kawamoto","original_name":"Takashi Kawamoto","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d4333e09f30087c1322f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483707,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takanori Yamaro","original_name":"Takanori Yamaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241d43dc50ad20047f849b4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Geq6y47mAKQKWU04LnNyCBXBI2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
