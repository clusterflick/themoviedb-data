Masha arrives at the quarry with a heavy heart, burdened by a secret she hasn’t told anyone about. She wants to speak with her mother, Vera, but she has struggles of her own. A young woman finds herself in a deafening masculine environment where no one's listening. A journey to save herself quickly blurs into a venture to save her own mother. Ants crawling on the walls of the house, childhood photos and Russian food, are the harsh reality of one woman, and a comforting memory for the other.","popularity":0.1578,"poster_path":"/1pcPkOrFdrqclx0Njsir71eTSTb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motherland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3485111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Fraifeld","original_name":"Lena Fraifeld","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":"/eHw80AFIPHIyaAGfNGXr5HDthRh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"624347e181140f0047bc5b40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Demidov","original_name":"Svetlana Demidov","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/8In0HEP9UpHZuxczb9XrqzusdST.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"624347ec0f36550096698d31","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1478031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Kashker","original_name":"Andrei Kashker","popularity":0.1294,"profile_path":"/dWGEZxeyoTtY6wDlpddePtkKpYT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"624347f3223a8b005faa97c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marek Rozenbaum","original_name":"Marek Rozenbaum","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"624347fc81140f005cdcc740","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201811,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Hila Royzenman","original_name":"Hila Royzenman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62434831223a8b0094249ee6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201811,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Hila Royzenman","original_name":"Hila Royzenman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243483edfe31d005bca139d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mattan Kedem","original_name":"Mattan Kedem","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62434869c740d9005d7c6541","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mattan Kedem","original_name":"Mattan Kedem","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243487b223a8b004ae6296f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3023650,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"May Abadi-Grebler","original_name":"May Abadi-Grebler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243485c223a8b005faa9928","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yossi Appelbaum","original_name":"Yossi Appelbaum","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6243489e0f36550096699030","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2120597,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Ori Alon","original_name":"Ori Alon","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624348aa5a99150090ca40a9","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uria Kedem","original_name":"Uria Kedem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624348499652200091cd18b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1064,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1pcPkOrFdrqclx0Njsir71eTSTb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":456,"name":"mother"},{"id":2981,"name":"homelessness"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":9957,"name":"loneliness"},{"id":294720,"name":"russians in israel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
