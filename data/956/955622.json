George D'Alroy, a young officer in the British Army who is infatuated with Esther, brings his friend, Captain Hawtree, to call. The captain is greatly taken with the lively Polly, who makes him carry the teakettle about and generally dance attendance on her to the emphatic disgust of Sam Garridge, an ardent suitor for Polly's hand. Meanwhile Esther shows George a letter from an impresario offering her an engagement on the stage. The offer seems a veritable godsend to the girl, but she changes her mind when George asks her to be his wife instead. A few months after they are married, George receives the unpleasant news that he must sail for India with his regiment. Owing to her ultra-aristocratic ideas, George has not dared to tell his mother, the Marchioness D'Alroy, that he has married a girl of common origin, and he is in a quandary as to what provision he should make for Esther.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":"/elpafuN2qMZf3zj4hvvmOR0GLwK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caste","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tucker","original_name":"Richard Tucker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/hMHZdVgcSOyhONnAbXNVSKHDwhh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Honorable George D'Alroy","credit_id":"62420ae51cfe3a00877202ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bigelow Cooper","original_name":"Bigelow Cooper","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/oATrZC8QWSKnhk1yR7f9YREd2oh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Hawtree","credit_id":"62420af8f85958005e5ab1e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William West","original_name":"William West","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eccles","credit_id":"62420b88d71fb4005be1400a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry O'Moore","original_name":"Barry O'Moore","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/6jZU8QqDfDnQOYxsWWM1zXWGv8i.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sam Gerridge","credit_id":"62420b9b223a8b004ae1e263","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3053454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Williams","original_name":"Ida Williams","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marquise De St. Maur","credit_id":"62420baddfe31d0047576363","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Trunnelle","original_name":"Mabel Trunnelle","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/aMWBE1QIuljeiPHZ6JV1dXEoylu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Polly Eccles","credit_id":"62420bbe97eab4005cb16c20","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude McCoy","original_name":"Gertrude McCoy","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/tneqF59Pgj02UajLvI7mENYjIFu.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Esther Eccles","credit_id":"62420bf69451e7008c945dcf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"C.J.
