His heart is warmed when he falls in love with his fragile neighbour, but then her illness takes a turn for the worse.  In Opéra de Monte Carlo's production of Puccini’s beloved opera, set in Paris to the interwar period, the artists’ misery looks more like a chosen lifestyle than a suffered fate. Jean-Louis Grinda’s sumptuous staging reflects on Puccini’s romantic glorification of the precariousness of the human condition.","popularity":0.1097,"poster_path":"/9Ry6Dvwmvnves9maFSbr6zL2TM6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La bohème – Opéra de Monte Carlo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Lungu","original_name":"Irina Lungu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f67b2681f0031e39a47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariam Battistelli","original_name":"Mariam Battistelli","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f6f1684f70038748f6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andeka Gorrotxategi","original_name":"Andeka Gorrotxategi","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f77b2681f0031e39a60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2169251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davide Luciano","original_name":"Davide Luciano","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/inE5KlS62wOXvyaRzRmUCcHeJ1F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f809ecf18003596c311","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Pinkhassovitch","original_name":"Boris Pinkhassovitch","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f9065e0a20033514b2b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Courjal","original_name":"Nicolas Courjal","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f951684f7003772ca23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrice Alibert","original_name":"Fabrice Alibert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1f9c41465c0036a825b2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Bonfiglio","original_name":"Guy Bonfiglio","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1fa320af770036f6fef6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Cristofoli","original_name":"Vincenzo Cristofoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e1fa99ecf18003596c333","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Louis Grinda","original_name":"Jean-Louis Grinda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4e1fc441465c0036a825d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575712,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniele Callegari","original_name":"Daniele Callegari","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4e1fb841465c0035a6eeda","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Ry6Dvwmvnves9maFSbr6zL2TM6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
