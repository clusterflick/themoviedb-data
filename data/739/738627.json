In the audience there is also an examiner, who will choose one of them for a TV show. For everyone this is the great opportunity to change their life, for some it could be the last one. The performances begin and each comedian takes the stage with a great dilemma: to respect the teachings of their master, devoted to intelligent and uncompromising comedy, or to twist their numbers to satisfy the much less refined taste of the examiner? Or maybe look for a third way, one of absolute originality? Through the stories of six comedians, Comedians is a reflection on the very meaning of comedy in our time, facing absolutely topical issues.","popularity":0.5823,"poster_path":"/hps25NkX5Kh4zDLkUM4Dx1ZavO8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18156,"logo_path":"/3nAuYcaWdpW0ULMvMz6V5HIJmCO.png","name":"Indiana
