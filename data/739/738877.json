While not all Christians have these sentiments, there are many Christians that are conflicted about their yoga practice. The central premise of this film is based on a yogic interpretation of a famous Bible verse: that the Kingdom of Heaven cannot be observed, for it is within you (Luke 17:21). As a compilation of interviews from yogis, Christians, and scholars comparing these ancient spiritual systems, director Bob Peck uses this documentary to examine why or how they might have a compatible application with one another.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kingdom Within","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richie Flores","original_name":"Richie Flores","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f4f3933da10f00036dfcbcc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763261,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Arnold","original_name":"Michael Arnold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4f390c09191b00350e6c03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763260,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Peck","original_name":"Bob Peck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4f38ff955c650037e1c708","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763263,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danny Yirgou","original_name":"Danny Yirgou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4f3922da10f00035dffca5","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cole Dabney","original_name":"Cole Dabney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4f38f7f96a39003397fe90","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3302276","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zanzibar International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"U.S. Premiere - Awareness Film Festival (Los Angeles)","release_date":"2014-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
