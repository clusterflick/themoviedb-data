Their names are Forever Man and Forever Woman. They are embodied by actors and actresses from long-gone eras, but also by cartoon characters and puppet animations. Together they narrate the story of the euphoric ups and tragic downs of human existence. When Forever Dies, a virtuoso collage of film fragments from the Eye Filmmuseum archive, is an epic ode to largely unseen cinema anchored in the polarizing world of today.","popularity":0.4983,"poster_path":"/tefbvtwxWiVoUbeXfJukcrrkQXM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tangerine
