He was sent to Dachau, Dora, Harzungen, Bergen-Belsen and Natzweiler – one of the Nazis' least known but most deadly camps. Twenty years after the war, Pahor wrote an extraordinary book about his experiences called Necropolis - City of the Dead.  Pahor’s harrowing descriptions are illustrated with remarkable drawings by fellow prisoners, creating a unique record of conditions in the Nazi death camps. His testimony, along with details from a shocking report into the camp by British intelligence officer Captain Yurka Galitzine and the chilling testimony by SS commandant Josef Kramer, infamous as the Beast of Belsen, combine to tell an extraordinary story.","popularity":1.7224,"poster_path":"/rGzNUaOPSbyRUjBnoSWRc4UtSQs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Saw Too Much","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Pahor","original_name":"Boris Pahor","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
