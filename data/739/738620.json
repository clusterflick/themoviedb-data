Britain 1942: A twenty-one-year-old Irishman was a living legend. With a shamrock emblazoned on the cockpit of his iconic Spitfire, he had flown through the Battle of Britain, unscathed – and into the hearts of an adoring and grateful British public, for whom he was a symbol of hope and pride. Though virtually unknown in his native country, Brendan 'Paddy' Finucane was adored by the British public and world media. A handsome 21 year old Irish man with a beautiful fiancée by his side, he distinguished himself during the Battle of Britain and led an RAF fighter wing on daring missions over enemy occupied Europe. Through a scrapbook of press cuttings, interviews, archive and personal family photographs, the film brings to life the story of a young boy with a passion for flying who became an RAF top scoring Ace and one of Ireland's forgotten heroes.","popularity":0.1624,"poster_path":"/39sTOuqsHywrDuxjLiX8dSOD9VR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spitfire Paddy: The Ace with the Shamrock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip O'Sullivan","original_name":"Phillip O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5f4e54c365e0a2003559d8b9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477808,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gerry Johnston","original_name":"Gerry Johnston","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4e54fc65e0a2003256b8ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477808,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gerry Johnston","original_name":"Gerry Johnston","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4e550f1684f70036789392","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7086282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/39sTOuqsHywrDuxjLiX8dSOD9VR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
