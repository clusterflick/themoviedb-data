His tone is darker and his projection more self-effacing than in the past, but class is permanent. His agility and legato are utterly thrilling. The ovations were never-ending.” (Corriere della sera) The present release is a production by Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London Recorded live at Teatro alla Scala, Milan, March 2018. Gluck’s Orpheo ed Euridice was first performed in 1762. It is the first of Gluck’s “reform” operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera sera with a “noble simplicity” in both the music and the drama. The present production was staged by Hofesh Shechter and John Fulljames.","popularity":0.2208,"poster_path":"/eASkAvkPvdd6NF060e3lDpaBB4g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26664,"logo_path":"/tmdslqWvUZVJoSmVD142vpD6845.png","name":"Teatro alla Scala","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":72200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clasart Classsic","origin_country":""},{"id":92986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belvedere-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orphée et Euridice - Teatro alla Scala","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":268115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Diego Flórez","original_name":"Juan Diego Flórez","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/5C27Cvb0Pvv1Nm8bmKy4T8SWzWI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Orphée","credit_id":"5f4cf74f41465c0036a350f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Karg","original_name":"Christiane Karg","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/kcmthJEdIY866WFIqpNpbyVRPXY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Euridice","credit_id":"5f4cf76665e0a200334f49ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2761582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fatma Said","original_name":"Fatma Said","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"L'Amour","credit_id":"5f4cf77b9ecf18003592f5f0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2588962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hofesh Shechter","original_name":"Hofesh Shechter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uqGPY83PoxqED86hEQpoyw3TyFx.jpg","credit_id":"615bc346b1f68d0027557eff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Fulljames","original_name":"John Fulljames","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615bc3558e2ba60021483409","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4cf79741465c0035a3174e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Mariotti","original_name":"Michele Mariotti","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4cf7afb2681f0033e1f668","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2588962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hofesh Shechter","original_name":"Hofesh Shechter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uqGPY83PoxqED86hEQpoyw3TyFx.jpg","credit_id":"5f4cf7c0223a8b0038b15781","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Fulljames","original_name":"John Fulljames","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4cf7ce9ecf18003894fbd4","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2588962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hofesh Shechter","original_name":"Hofesh Shechter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uqGPY83PoxqED86hEQpoyw3TyFx.jpg","credit_id":"5f4cf7d89ecf18003592f61e","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761584,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Conor Murphy","original_name":"Conor Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4cf7edb2681f0030dc3278","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761584,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Conor Murphy","original_name":"Conor Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4cf7fb1684f700357654e4","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eASkAvkPvdd6NF060e3lDpaBB4g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
