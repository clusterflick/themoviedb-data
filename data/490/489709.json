Numerous 16mm films were sent to Sears, but only one film was preserved; however, as it was not complete, it could not be used. In 2003, the Munich cinémathèque museum restored the film, which  narrates a Ring Lardner short story. The missing parts were filled in from a radio play recorded in 1946.","popularity":0.4824,"poster_path":"/9sGbFZdoT0eC2s1Bf7daevRRUO4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening with Orson Welles: The Golden Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1daeb90e0a264cd006bb4d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5a1daec30e0a264cbc06daab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5a1daec90e0a264cd006bb5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024561,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ring Lardner","original_name":"Ring Lardner","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1daeef925141032c06c387","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5fc769093a340b0040e3671e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":30683,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gary Graver","original_name":"Gary Graver","popularity":2.188,"profile_path":"/hgxyf9QroD3VyKefTXt8ymxCP2t.jpg","credit_id":"5fc76913a1074b0041ecafe3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5fc769222fdec6003b7bd578","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5fc775b420e6a5003b257521","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5fc775c113a388003e05da61","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0489485","wikidata_id":"Q4749972","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9sGbFZdoT0eC2s1Bf7daevRRUO4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUZS4Sf68hkRpJ4k8DKQyC7tS9o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
