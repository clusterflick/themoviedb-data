The first of its tales aptly deals with contemporary civil unrest with foci on the interrelationships between law enforcement in communities it serves, and corruption within the justice system as a whole. It unfolds from the perspective of an African-American male who feels circumstantially slighted by society, and because of that, takes the law into his own hands and goes on a rampage which erupts into a war in the process.","popularity":0.551,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Link Egglepple Starbureiy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald VelJohnson","original_name":"Reginald VelJohnson","popularity":0.8945,"profile_path":"/r0F5y1PAQEDM08MBj3oI1IIX4gi.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Alven","credit_id":"5a1e47820e0a264cc40719e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Link Starbureiy","original_name":"Link Starbureiy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fergus","credit_id":"5a1e479a9251410330071a49","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roderick Thorp","original_name":"Roderick Thorp","popularity":0.2868,"profile_path":"/tbvs5BuzGOTofu5hRlhCvg7cUED.jpg","credit_id":"5a1e48230e0a264cc1072fd8","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.
