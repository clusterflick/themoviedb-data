After holding out for months without food, water, or medical supplies, and under heavy artillery and sniper fire, the camp fell to the militias on 12 August. What followed was one of the worst atrocities of the civil war, with over 2,500 civilians massacred and the camp razed to the ground. Produced after the massacre, but featuring footage shot before and during the siege, Tall al-Zaatar remembers the camp and its community, recounting the long months of siege and resistance, and recalling the horrors of the massacre through the testimony of survivors.","popularity":0.1361,"poster_path":"/i4097YlJc5sOYULJnIcHwP2FAxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tall el Zaatar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tall al-Zaatar","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tall el-Zaatar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Khalil Chamoun","original_name":"Jean Khalil Chamoun","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1f3a2ac3a3680b93082fbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pino Adriano","original_name":"Pino Adriano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1f3a51c3a3680b8f0826ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mustafa Abu Ali","original_name":"Mustafa Abu Ali","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/qTZebrYWMI4foTEigu6qBIlm2rb.jpg","credit_id":"5a1f3a100e0a264cbc085d18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1988191","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kB2HLWdUUUBUPNu3EtB0rg1JbYx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i4097YlJc5sOYULJnIcHwP2FAxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
