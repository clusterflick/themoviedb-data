The Pilgrims explores the forces, circumstances, personalities and events that converged to exile the English group in Holland and eventually propel their crossing to the New World; a story universally familiar in broad outline, but almost entirely unfamiliar to a general audience in its rich and compelling historical actuality. Includes the real history of the \"first thanksgiving\".","popularity":2.7858,"poster_path":"/ybyknC34jRDZg9gt58iyieRZ0Rh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"GBH","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10725,"logo_path":"/rLfwt5kPoXfJweOsEDgJhhBnN7Q.png","name":"WETA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":45012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steeplechase
