A moral lesson they probably needed; and a real insight into the imaginary mindset of Dixon of Dock Green Britain. Mention bank robbers now and youâ€™re as likely to think of bankers receiving bizarre bonuses than robbers of the traditional 1950s kind.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bank Robbers","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
