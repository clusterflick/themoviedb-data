When the Nazis come to power in the 1930s, her family has to flee the country without being able to bring any of their belongings. Even young Anna's pink toy rabbit has been confiscated along with the family's other possessions. Initially the family lives in Switzerland, but even here they come to feel the antisemitism. And when money becomes scarce, and Anna's father can't find work as a journalist and Jew, they move on to France, where they are no long submitted to racial discrimination, but struggle financially. Eventually the entire family manages to go to England.","popularity":0.2363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Als Hitler das rosa Kaninchen stahl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter Meisner","original_name":"Günter Meisner","popularity":0.3596,"profile_path":"/ox9kMd3d7HMEdKI38A9zudZFHKp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Berg","credit_id":"5a1b6d84c3a3680b930499cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grete Wurm","original_name":"Grete Wurm","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/iUy8j1XyAYZWh9EGhXeVGMBpspu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frl.
