A found footage family film about love and passion, friendship and heartbreak in Berlin between the wars. But ​a film ​also about self-sufficiency and recycling​, about the green movement and the environment​ – before these ​notion​s had yet been properly invented. And it ​touches​ the utopian potential of ideas that have lain buried in the ground of an island for the past 70 years. The film’s protagonist, Martin Elsaesser, was one of the most prominent modernist architects of Weimar Germany.","popularity":0.2503,"poster_path":"/1HFQEbtZJAgghRn865vvNZeMrfP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sun Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Elsaesser","original_name":"Thomas Elsaesser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1f4a7dc3a3680b93083d0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1HFQEbtZJAgghRn865vvNZeMrfP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":2301,"name":"architect"},{"id":6389,"name":"frankfurt am main, germany"},{"id":235231,"name":"urban planning"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Deutsche TV-Premiere","release_date":"2018-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer_Die Sonneninsel","key":"271259922","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-22T12:02:01.000Z","id":"65ff34a0b84cdd0164f4a292"}]}}}
