Each film in the 26 episode series had to be an essay on an aspect of the war, because the length and separate aspects of the war was far too much to cover in detail. Jeremy Isaacs talks about the production process and the aims of the project. The intention of the crew that were involved with the various skills in making 'The World at War' had no desire to use film from British, German, French, Polish, Russian, Japanese, or the Americans because of their specific means of showing the winning side of a specific action. Rather, an effort was made to interview people who were not part of the establishment, but rather the common people or assistants and secretaries of historical persons. Film was researched for those films from cameras where there was no special subject, but those that would allow the viewer to make their own decisions about what they had just seen and heard.","popularity":0.2061,"poster_path":"/nDE3fQ4yzQpF8kuEBTWg0KQG7iD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/h9O2O30eqiYaNi8qRKclV2U4Wjw.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World at War: The Making of the Series","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5abf8f31c3a368444402b44d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":126918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Isaacs","original_name":"Jeremy Isaacs","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5abf8f4e925141601802873c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Speer","original_name":"Albert Speer","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/yyJbtaRBKlaESmqX2h8oZz6ZtcI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5abf8f76925141602a0293ae","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1930366,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeremy Issacs","original_name":"Jeremy Issacs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1b7911925141033604a858","department":"Crew","job":"Presenter"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1816012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nDE3fQ4yzQpF8kuEBTWg0KQG7iD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":787}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":50244,"name":"making of"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
