Its way of fighting involved kidnappings and assassinations of government officials as well as representatives of foreign firms. The crusade of the military junta against its terrorist practices later became a pretext for state terror against civilians who had nothing to do with ERP. Gleyzer's so-called \"secret film\" records the kidnapping of a manager of the meat processing factory and cooling plant Swift. The partisans request an improvement in the working conditions in the factory in exchange for his release.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1zGTIIdRRWqC323Ov0tTnSm1E2E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine de la Base","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swift, 1971","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cine de la Base","original_name":"Cine de la Base","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1d1ff2c3a3680b93062a84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymundo Gleyzer","original_name":"Raymundo Gleyzer","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":"/64Fy6ZkvV4mhDLiGrb151k3TpwY.jpg","credit_id":"5a1d1fe79251410333060c37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0313672","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1087,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1zGTIIdRRWqC323Ov0tTnSm1E2E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
