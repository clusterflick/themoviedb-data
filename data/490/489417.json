Shot on location around the world, the film's message is clear and unflinching -- either confront the realities of climate change or suffer the consequences of lost civilizations and failed states. Ultimately Plan B provides audiences with a glimpse into a new and emerging economy based upon renewable resources as well as strategies to avoid the growing threat of global warming. Appearing with Lester Brown are Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman, Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Friedman, former Governor and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, along with other scholars and scientists. Locations include: China, Japan, South Korea, India, Italy, Turkey, Bangladesh, Zambia, Haiti, and the U.S.","popularity":0.2936,"poster_path":"/2xJVGbHhP68KhItAdlFtJ3QO4wP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plan B","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lester Brown","original_name":"Lester Brown","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a1c4cdd925141032c058082","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Damon","original_name":"Matt Damon","popularity":6.9377,"profile_path":"/4KAxONjmVq7qcItdXo38SYtnpul.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5a1c4ceb0e0a264ccd058bac","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Weiner","original_name":"Hal Weiner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1c4d0492514103290591d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Weiner","original_name":"Hal Weiner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1c4cfd0e0a264cbc0598c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1737667","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kQSoaGwqAzGsJb5Pyeu8klNuHkv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2xJVGbHhP68KhItAdlFtJ3QO4wP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
