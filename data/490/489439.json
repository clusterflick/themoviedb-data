As they sit and wait for their train in silence, two complete strangers on a bench, what the audience soon learns that they themselves don't know, is that they once shared the happiest day of their lives, playing together as children. Yet it's now too far back for them to remember anymore, too far back for them to recognize each other anymore. The story then shifts back and forth between the breathtaking landscape of their unconscious', as Isabel Lucas and Oliver Ackland play more youthful representations of how they see themselves inside, and search for the memory they once shared.","popularity":0.6194,"poster_path":"/11awOmqu196jC5iOnhn1pzglNE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Engram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":191661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Ackland","original_name":"Oliver Ackland","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":"/iaJdYNsr0ntEope4pOXhvaMDYcS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4d60cfc3a36823e0043892","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Lucas","original_name":"Isabel Lucas","popularity":1.0619,"profile_path":"/dxIZvymamZaeJ46HDJ0ldaJmG2v.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4d60d50e0a26454404b6ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Curtis-Green","original_name":"Joey Curtis-Green","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":"/mClvY9WIpApTNTPnalEy1sL4vK4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4d60ddc3a36823e305354c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Epstein","original_name":"Alvin Epstein","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/ulT5IYEjCYC8HJkUIrXlUz6h7e4.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64d291bac3bffe0f00497d37","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Falletti","original_name":"Julia Falletti","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4d60fa9251417d0f0440f6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Patton","original_name":"Lucille Patton","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":"/AoAs1TVyHWwi2hh06grLoK14X3X.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4d61049251417d270496f8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Betts","original_name":"Margaret Betts","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/tDxTMkRY1JEuJCxpq8BGlkzAxit.jpg","credit_id":"5a1c60f9c3a3680b8a0579df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Betts","original_name":"Margaret Betts","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/tDxTMkRY1JEuJCxpq8BGlkzAxit.jpg","credit_id":"5a1c610692514103390587bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179838,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jennifer Ruff","original_name":"Jennifer Ruff","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ced3fedc3a36825e11f1231","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Ciancimino","original_name":"Christopher Ciancimino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ced40050e0a26286cc9ffcb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Betts","original_name":"Margaret Betts","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/tDxTMkRY1JEuJCxpq8BGlkzAxit.jpg","credit_id":"5ced40100e0a265cded9aa06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":979183,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kat Westergaard","original_name":"Kat Westergaard","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ced3fde0e0a263f4acb5311","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3748128","wikidata_id":"Q111938273","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/11awOmqu196jC5iOnhn1pzglNE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
