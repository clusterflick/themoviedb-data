A cliff-face explodes in slow motion; an industrial drill bores into a huge block of rock; the word 'AIDS' is chiselled into the polished surface of a granite headstone and a \"Don't Die of Ignorance\" leaflet drops onto the surface along with an elegiac bouquet of white lilies. The solemnity of the accompanying voice-over quells any vestiges of ambiguity.","popularity":0.5404,"poster_path":"/rhLzzpMe4TzJ6jKGra5H2scP1zc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't die of ignorance.","title":"Monolith","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hurt","original_name":"John Hurt","popularity":1.8848,"profile_path":"/bjNSzt1d7uK3q5PbtFXUJrRt4qg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65da19ed72d8550185bcb832","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Roeg","original_name":"Nicolas Roeg","popularity":0.3244,"profile_path":"/t5EuHzllJjQrlVqzniVHDXBqUEC.jpg","credit_id":"65da1a4d609750017da6e15a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rhLzzpMe4TzJ6jKGra5H2scP1zc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":319579,"name":"public information film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
