Not Arsura (Max Veneziano), not Albafiorita (Vilem Cage), not Fabrizio (Matthias Vannelli), the hunky waiter who's fallen in love with the boss, but settles for the village twinks (Matt Van Dorn).  When gruff Ripafratta (Michele Luppo) professes his freedom from the allure of beauty, Sasha sets out to win him over. And win him over he does, teasing the sullen guest, charming him and finally conquering him. Meantime, the suitors take comfort in each other's company (Vilem with Eric Flower; Max with Vilem and Giorgio Salieri); the innkeeper in Fabrizio's arms.  THE INNKEEPER - HOTEL ITALIA 2 is based on Carlo Goldoni's famed play, \"La locandiera\", first staged in 1752. It was filmed in the Tuscan countryside, not far from Florence, in June 2003.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2hDXB7NneXCahy6cdfa78XMtdQo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65901,"logo_path":"/oeWBArIal3HbA4PUYCNW1eunBtB.png","name":"Lucas Kazan
