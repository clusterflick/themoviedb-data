Cut off from time and the jungle below, feared by natives because of \"evil spirits\", flying reptiles and other beasts, Roraima has sparked human imagination since the time of the 19th century explorers. Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his book \"The Lost World\" (1912) about men and dinosaurs on the tales from early explorers to this plateau. This was the inspiration for Jurassic Park. The modern expedition team encounters the animals, people and extreme habitat on its route across the Gran Sabana and up the 9000 ft. mountain. Once there they explore a new cave system, that may well contain new forms of life.","popularity":0.5481,"poster_path":"/q0j7VBOwfLKxoFoxDd7auoFFclJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gryphon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Lost World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sprouse","original_name":"Peter Sprouse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65da83c2e9c0dc0163c106dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Barton","original_name":"Hazel Barton","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65da83e805b54901621657dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Heald","original_name":"Seth Heald","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65da83f54c1d9a017d6efdff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick C.
