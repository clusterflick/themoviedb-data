Their exchanges are rooted in present-day Colombian society, but they are nonetheless indicative of the situation of trans women in most countries worldwide. In response to this discrimination, each proposes a gesture, or an action. Danys delivers an intimate poem; Yenny proudly dominates the city; Paola links sex work and hairdressing with pride and ambition.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treading on Your Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amélie Cabocel","original_name":"Amélie Cabocel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8913aa284eb01858826df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
