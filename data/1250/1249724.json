In 1993, Maillot became artistic director of the Ballets de Monte-Carlo, creating over 30 ballets for the company, including 'Romeo and Juliet' (1996), 'Scheherazade' (2009), and 'Opus 50' (2011). Based on Charles Perrault’s famous fairy tale, Maillot staged this unconventional and unique version of 'La Belle', which explores the darker side of Perrault’s story. The incredible choreography is set to the score of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, performed by the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Nicolas Brochot. Besides the performers of the Ballets de Monte-Carlo, the production features star dancers of the Bolshoi Ballet: Semyon Chudin (Prince) and Olga Smirnova (La Belle). This performance was recorded at the Salle des Princes of the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco, in December 2016.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/rRh40nVw0eY7Ux1sLgDqTbysaWi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Belle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rdkjM6JKtCaxUnTwb4RYIBCvo1A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":935,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rRh40nVw0eY7Ux1sLgDqTbysaWi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":624}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"La Belle\" - Jean-Christophe Maillot","key":"cnoOgrtTt74","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-23T15:21:59.000Z","id":"65da4a2b1750510149f87e4f"}]}}}
