It is an amazing tale of courageous women who left behind their families, knowing they would never see them again and of girls who were shipped off to the New World to marry men they had never met. These are the women who fought against the many forms of racism they faced in Canada while, at the same time, challenging sexism within their own communities. By passing on language, culture, and values to their children, these women defined what it means to be Chinese Canadian. Beautiful old photographs from family albums, the recollections of seven women who grew up in Canada in the first half of the 20th century, and the memories of narrator and director, Dora Nipp, whose grandfather came to Canada in 1881 to build the railway, create a remarkable story of stunning impact.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":"/pc1hfokvf3zBEEO95iJq8MKWam3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Willow Tree: Pioneer Chinese Women in Canada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123025,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Savas Kalogeras","original_name":"Savas Kalogeras","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8d1fef9183a016355d0d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4553178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dora Nipp","original_name":"Dora Nipp","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8d1f330aa310187d1347d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713683,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Margaret Wong","original_name":"Margaret Wong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8d215b76cbb0165f109f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707255,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"MeiYen Chan","original_name":"MeiYen Chan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8d208a3e4ba0149533981","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4553178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dora Nipp","original_name":"Dora Nipp","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8d1ef2da84601877230df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0237874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":951,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pc1hfokvf3zBEEO95iJq8MKWam3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":634}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
