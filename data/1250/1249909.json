The film is a synthesis of archival materials from Asian film history, from different countries. The result is an intelligent operating system of 48 digits, born into a half-human, half-golden-snail figure. ANGSUMALIN 48 can dissolve and become invisible to human eyes in order to penetrate through the air as a secret cultural agent. ANGSUMALIN 48 women have the role of building connections, spreading good relations, and providing support for the alliance of Asian women in different countries to rise up and release their past painâ€”from WWII to the Cold War to today. The name of this operating system is chosen to commemorate and give honor to Angsumalin, a fictional character from the Thai novel Khu Kam (1969) by Thommayanti, and an emblem of honesty, loyalty, and love for the homeland.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ANG48","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1887347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chulayarnnon Siriphol","original_name":"Chulayarnnon Siriphol","popularity":0.2174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dae11e8261ee0185c2500f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
