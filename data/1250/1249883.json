When his father says he won’t leave unless he gets to take his broken down 1986 Toyota Van with him, something he’d much rather leave behind, things get worse. Left with no choice, the son hires a mechanic to fix the van, but finds that what’s really broken is the relationship between himself and his father; a relationship that has been non-existent since the passing of his mother. The son wants his father to move in with his new family and move on with his life, but letting go is easier said than done.","popularity":0.574,"poster_path":"/ps8OC3onnUAObHf12RfK9zpQTuB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
