One day, two ranger men walked by and saw them living. They climbed up the tree and saw the twin sisters. Sadly, One of the sisters was raped and killed by the two men, and the other was able to escape from the killer. She was running with a bloody body, and she fell and later was dragged by a man (Trank Der) to his home. The dead sister became a powerful ghost. She hates men; she threatens to kill all villagers, especially men. She protected her sister and warned her not to love men. The people in the town got confused because they have the same face and the living sister was accused of being a ghost who has killed many people in the village, again particularly men. She was arrested by the villagers and was to be executed. She was later released and ordered to leave her hometown. She now lives with a man (Kon Samoeun) who saved her life. She is happy with her new life, living with him without fear.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/647Cfc7mWPR603xpLCyMVEknNre.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","title":"Beysach Kromom","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trente Deux","original_name":"Trente Deux","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"65d8a3fb40d0fe0185a16aee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4553009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Ruth","original_name":"Chuck Ruth","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Living Sister","credit_id":"65d8a43ccedac40185543581","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kong Som Eun","original_name":"Kong Som Eun","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/w82kCecltf6vHFy17OZQszW5Ndu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65d8a454944a57017c24bbc9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ly You Sreang","original_name":"Ly You Sreang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d8a3b69369a2018663b206","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14838434","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1148,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/647Cfc7mWPR603xpLCyMVEknNre.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":861}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"km","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
