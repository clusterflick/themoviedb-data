Since 2012, a series of repressive laws were passed, labelling everyone who publicly disagreed with the official narrative as „foreign agent“. In these circumstances, a group of independent Russian media and activists are trying to resist and continue their work. Right after the invasion their work becomes virtually impossible. Shot during one decisive year, before and after the invasion, the new film by fearless filmmaker Askold Kurov (The Trial  - The State of Russia vs. Oleg Sentsov) portrays the last defenders of democracy in Russia and gives a glimpse of hope for another future.","popularity":0.3984,"poster_path":"/kg8fAYxATX0J1mfIWgbVxeZxdp7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anonymous
