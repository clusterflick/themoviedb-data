Its unique tone, which expertly straddles laugh-out-loud comedy and heartbreaking drama, depicts the reality of losing an unwanted pregnancy. Pregnancy loss is extremely common yet grossly under-depicted in TV and film. Here in the US, dangerous abortion laws are passing everyday. Fish Bowl is a radically pro-choice film that needs to be seen. A haunting score comopsed by Nandi Rose, known for her own music as Half Waif, provides a powerful undercurrent for writer, director, and lead actor Rachel Sweeneyâ€™s tour de force performance.","popularity":0.079,"poster_path":"/hKhwAxqIjyqM2aw8fW6koyEwQFY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not a body.","title":"Fish Bowl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Sweeney","original_name":"Rachel Sweeney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Zoe","credit_id":"65d925bd3520e80187d661d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1764557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Culhane","original_name":"Jeremy Culhane","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/vrmnlXy1qmf50zFTER9Ak2CFBmW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jude","credit_id":"65d925caaaf8970165bc5de2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4553730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Serje","original_name":"Michelle Serje","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"65d925daaaf897017ebc6b9d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Sweeney","original_name":"Rachel Sweeney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d92fcf42f19f01861a1d80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Sweeney","original_name":"Rachel Sweeney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d92fdbfc5f060185cabe07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4300945,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tamara Santos","original_name":"Tamara Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d9301b9a358d0186ff5bfa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hKhwAxqIjyqM2aw8fW6koyEwQFY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
