France, colonizer since 1830, hastened to reinforce its military contingent in the four corners of the country and to prevent the advance of the rebels. A little Chaoui, born in a mountainous region of the country, sees his placid childhood collapse in the middle of a crossfire that he does not understand. The story, inspired by real testimonies, is constructed with images from the archives of the French army. From this apparently dissociated dialogue between image and word arises a sensitive homage to the memory that rests in the archives and to the ignored voice of its protagonists.","popularity":0.2812,"poster_path":"/lPFaqNjenhz4830zFjjyesABk2T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Dodier","original_name":"Anna Dodier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"65da80e362f33501494c151c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4498587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Blasco","original_name":"Frédéric Blasco","popularity":0.182,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"65da81131750510187f8a5fc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3440408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","original_name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da760f62f335017c4c322d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3440408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","original_name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da7a16cabfe40186d032fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3440408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","original_name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da76301750510163f88c3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555679,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Jose Delgado","original_name":"Juan Jose Delgado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da816da24c5001860f5dda","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fanny Wojkiewicz","original_name":"Fanny Wojkiewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da84f9e9c0dc0130c0f427","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4555674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Markunda Aurès","original_name":"Markunda Aurès","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da81369f1be7018568d06c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3440408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","original_name":"María Alejandra Zúñiga Delgado","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65da850362f335017c4c4671","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31465746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3gBWxT8uPQrv5udfCREzAxN3R6P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPFaqNjenhz4830zFjjyesABk2T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":293846,"name":"liberation war"},{"id":302822,"name":"aurès"},{"id":324637,"name":"berbere culture"},{"id":329191,"name":"chaoui"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
