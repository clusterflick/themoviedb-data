A reminder of the way in which sunlight allows images to appear onto surfaces such as water or glass. Though these things can all be easily explained through science, their appearance is other wordly, seeming to materialise from somewhere unknown. Therefore throughout the film the role of reflections directly influences the movements and experiences of two unknown women, where it is becomes apparent that it is they themselves who are reflecting each other.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/p1TJRA0z2jv9BJbGHltJ7HeRdSL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Specular","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102515,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Veronica Charmont","original_name":"Veronica Charmont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67530eb3871a42c9c245388a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p1TJRA0z2jv9BJbGHltJ7HeRdSL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1273}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
