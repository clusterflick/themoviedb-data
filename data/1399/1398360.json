Oliver has schizophrenia and struggles with alcohol use disorder. He drinks to cope with his psychiatric issues, but his dual diagnosis makes it challenging to find effective treatment.

The Testament of Oliver reveals what happens to the people who fall through the cracks of the healthcare system. Nilsson’s documentary offers a raw and hardhitting account of a man in dire need  of specialized treatment and support systems. Nilsson captures her dear friend’s struggles with an unflinching eye, sharing Oliver’s soaring highs and crushing lows on his arduous road to recovery.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/AaUILfRLOXrQOGUDtJa7nXEIzy4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Testament of Oliver","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Juvonen-Peel","original_name":"Oliver Juvonen-Peel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6752f3f04624397fa8117ef2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Nilsson","original_name":"Jessica Nilsson","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/xvfHT604399nxX0HJqiPMY6iHns.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6752f409ab6cc3a4c8fc8d65","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Nilsson","original_name":"Jessica Nilsson","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/xvfHT604399nxX0HJqiPMY6iHns.jpg","credit_id":"6752f422f043bd8a60275187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361790,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jesper Jack","original_name":"Jesper Jack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752f446b1eaa5c891dafc0b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTwfFQIT88SGv6zqSI3XjpaJssO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AaUILfRLOXrQOGUDtJa7nXEIzy4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"DR2 21:30","release_date":"2019-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
