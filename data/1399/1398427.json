Then I’m joined by the guys from The Resonance, and we have some intros to them before we talk through a playback of the title track from the album that was released that day: No Hill For A Climber. So you get to hear about all the various elements that went into that song.  1. Already There\r 2. To Love You And Be Alive\r 3. The Kind of Heart\r 4. The Resonance – introductions\r 5.
