It is a kind of \"making of\", a documentary that brings a new dimension of reality, humor, absurdity to this music. In addition to an intense experience of traditional, but less known to the public, Romani original music, the film also brings the social context of the singers' lives and an intimate picture of the emotional world of the Roma. It is a real, vivid and at the same time positive picture of the Romani minority.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Občianske združenie Žudro","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2010-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cigarettes & Songs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188837,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marek Šulík","original_name":"Marek Šulík","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753f325871a42c9c24555ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188837,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marek Šulík","original_name":"Marek Šulík","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753f32b871a42c9c24555b2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188837,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marek Šulík","original_name":"Marek Šulík","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753f332b1eaa5c891db1d51","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2552444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jana Bučka Kovalčíková","original_name":"Jana Bučka Kovalčíková","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/6adihoW4MTMU5qMNzljCr9eyYdV.jpg","credit_id":"6753f33cab6cc3a4c8fca173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2552444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jana Bučka Kovalčíková","original_name":"Jana Bučka Kovalčíková","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/6adihoW4MTMU5qMNzljCr9eyYdV.jpg","credit_id":"6753f34eab6cc3a4c8fca179","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2552444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jana Bučka Kovalčíková","original_name":"Jana Bučka Kovalčíková","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/6adihoW4MTMU5qMNzljCr9eyYdV.jpg","credit_id":"6753f356b1eaa5c891db1d5d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15041270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"MAFF Bratislava 2010","release_date":"2010-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
