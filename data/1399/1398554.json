This is the origin story of social media, youtube reality stars, and selfies.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lHjFZEEAQf6XfiAkXSX1dugeNlk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Everything Is Terrible!","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Hole - Animals Are Over!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1361,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lHjFZEEAQf6XfiAkXSX1dugeNlk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":907}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
