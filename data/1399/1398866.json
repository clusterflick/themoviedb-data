They leave everything behind: love, family and their carefree youth. But when the reality of war overtakes them, they are confronted with the raw and relentless truth. When the violence takes its toll, they face a struggle that goes beyond the battlefield. The loss of home, the traumas that haunt them, and the question of whether they will ever find themselves again drive them to extremes.","popularity":0.1016,"poster_path":"/6y4gBC3eQmM6MHxvLjPy1lF7tRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84387,"logo_path":"/rmIZMZvwb7rMNCTZMGHnduRKXkT.png","name":"The Coca-Cola
