Its ingredients are rooted in the land's geography and seasons, while its flavors reflect its conflicts and politics. Palestinian cuisine carries within it a blend of popular, personal, and feminine history; it intertwines with the narrative found in books, adds depth to it, and brings it to life.  Cook and culinary historian Muzna Bishara embarks on an eight-chapter journey, one that also explores a vanishing generation of women who preserve the memory of rural cooking. Each chapter focuses on a key ingredient or raw material, its region of cultivation, its season, and a local family who works with it. Olives, sumac, akoub, and eggplants are among the foundational elements that shape the flavor of the land—stories that Muzna seeks to uncover, offering a new way to touch the tragic history of her people.","popularity":0.1574,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grounded","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muzna Bishara","original_name":"Muzna Bishara","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"675317e0f043bd8a6027588e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shady Srour","original_name":"Shady Srour","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675318618af6d3feb3b0167d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilla Medalia","original_name":"Hilla Medalia","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/68lHnt3NabSSIV42xDQhFfGhvs.jpg","credit_id":"6753186e516edeab299947d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102341,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rotem Heyman","original_name":"Rotem Heyman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753187a8e033e9136dc8809","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625021,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avner Shahaf","original_name":"Avner Shahaf","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67531887ab37fcd3e8853180","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2101380,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Naaman Bishara","original_name":"Naaman Bishara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67531897516edeab299947da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1108868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miri Laufer","original_name":"Miri Laufer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675318a28af6d3feb3b0169a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2016711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Markovich","original_name":"Daniel Markovich","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675318ac8af6d3feb3b016a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s4B736JdtLTxK3yCHSrDTil58qr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grounded preopening eng","key":"Ewls6eJMQmA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-29T16:37:00.000Z","id":"67531843802bad16091aba3a"}]}}}
