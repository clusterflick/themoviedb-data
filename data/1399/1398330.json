Stefano Cappellaro plows through the mountains following his goats. A nomad of places, he has a center within himself, but he is not antisocial.  He found a way to support himself by getting milk from animals, water from rocks, food from the garden, and a little money for flour, rice and  newspaper from some manual work. It is made of the same substance as the grass, the moss and the stone that frames the Valle Cervo, in the  Biella area, where it lives all year round along the course of the stream of the same name. He doesn't accept this society; he longs for another one  made up of authentic relationships. In the meantime, he does his part by giving an example of how it is possible to live with little, smiling.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vaJMVfM66TgktNIwQX0ejgp0CRP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prospettiva Nevskij","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HOMO HÛMÎLIS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Cappellaro","original_name":"Stefano Cappellaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6752e257802bad16091ab454","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuele Cecconello","original_name":"Manuele Cecconello","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e27dab6cc3a4c8fc8915","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuele Cecconello","original_name":"Manuele Cecconello","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e285ab37fcd3e88527c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuele Cecconello","original_name":"Manuele Cecconello","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e2c8ab6cc3a4c8fc8933","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuele Cecconello","original_name":"Manuele Cecconello","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e2d4802bad16091ab47b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuele Cecconello","original_name":"Manuele Cecconello","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e2e8ab6cc3a4c8fc8949","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luca Sigurtà","original_name":"Luca Sigurtà","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e309ab6cc3a4c8fc8975","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luca Sigurtà","original_name":"Luca Sigurtà","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e312ab37fcd3e8852806","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Taglier","original_name":"Andrea Taglier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e32cfa107dc4ed404e51","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leonardo Jon Scotta","original_name":"Leonardo Jon Scotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752e33bb1eaa5c891daf6b6","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ROCZdZo0G1TFFs8U1uKYMCQcHa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":756,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/vaJMVfM66TgktNIwQX0ejgp0CRP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival delle Foreste 2024","release_date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
