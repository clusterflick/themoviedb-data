And the communities and ecosystems that are most threatened by rising sea levels and storms will continue to bear the brunt of the Ike Dike’s costly shortcomings. IT IS A GOOD PROJECT AND SHOULD BE BUILT offers perspectives on intervening in purposefully opaque bureaucratic procedures and demonstrates the importance of questioning seemingly innocuous administrative performances through imaginative and collaborative methods.  --Max Fields","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/2QNjAyHW3wxToPNr5ivatCOF7dy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IT IS A GOOD PROJECT AND SHOULD BE BUILT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Schmidt-Arenales","original_name":"Fred Schmidt-Arenales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754b033a18cb8695afd5225","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Schmidt-Arenales","original_name":"Fred Schmidt-Arenales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754b042187d27b266a3a9ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Schmidt-Arenales","original_name":"Fred Schmidt-Arenales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754b050a7b2fcb11e524be4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QNjAyHW3wxToPNr5ivatCOF7dy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
