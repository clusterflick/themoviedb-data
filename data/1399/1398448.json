The farm and its little world are presented during the four seasons: the introduction of children to agricultural work, the holidays, the return to school. From November to the end of April, the older ones take courses in the various agricultural schools scattered across Quebec. In addition to studying the methods of cultivation and breeding, they receive notions of carpentry, blacksmithing and other lessons likely to be useful in their future work as farmers. In the spring, the young girls go to secondary schools of agriculture to learn domestic art, beekeeping, weaving, sewing, etc.","popularity":0.1949,"poster_path":"/sXyQT2kgzx7gr7R2l0O5tHbQjBJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Service de ciné-photographie du Québec","origin_country":""},{"id":246597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omega Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rural Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Proulx","original_name":"Maurice Proulx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753260880e5b8f0a7564151","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4245623,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Vergnes","original_name":"Michel Vergnes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67532624516edeab2999499e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102440,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Charles Magnan","original_name":"Jean-Charles Magnan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675326aadf3ae97e1c2f2e52","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26255680","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/siwoFfslIerQWtTKVI1kn2cufQ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sXyQT2kgzx7gr7R2l0O5tHbQjBJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":293194,"name":"youth"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jeunesse rurale","key":"TF8HI4-48TE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2014-11-03T20:00:19.000Z","id":"675327e5f043bd8a60275bf2"}]}}}
