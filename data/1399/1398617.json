Six feet  under the street where Egypt meets the Gaza strip, they laugh while  comparing the conflict to a cartoon: \"it's always Jerry who wins\"! But this  laughter stops when Israel's bombs shake the earth. It's December 2008, and  Israel's deadly air strikes, which will destroy almost all of the tunnels  transporting supplies from Egypt to Palestine, have begun. When the worst  of the bombing stops, the men emerge from the shells of their former homes  with new drive: \"they destroy one, and another one appears\". Because as  long as Israel's embargo stands, stopping even foreign aid from coming into  Palestine, the tunnels remain an important symbol of resistance and a  matter of pride. \"Some tunnels transport weapons,\" acknowledges Abu  Sleeman, but for him, it's just about \"bringing back food, so people can  survive\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x559ybAzOMmgrHCTztIUxati0R1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abu Jamil Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Abu Jamil St.","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Οδός Αμπού Τζαμίλ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marchetti","original_name":"Stéphane Marchetti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/aWkLxFByvgrbnvzlfuaz3qtNzys.jpg","credit_id":"675386ce802bad16091acb6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marchetti","original_name":"Stéphane Marchetti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/aWkLxFByvgrbnvzlfuaz3qtNzys.jpg","credit_id":"675389ba516edeab29995a49","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marchetti","original_name":"Stéphane Marchetti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/aWkLxFByvgrbnvzlfuaz3qtNzys.jpg","credit_id":"675389cc516edeab29995a4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5103292,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Damien Traversaz","original_name":"Damien Traversaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67538a1772d1a8a59c29c042","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Monchovet","original_name":"Alexis Monchovet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67def7b4210fa80a0f4d753f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Monchovet","original_name":"Alexis Monchovet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67def7cc210fa80a0f4d7547","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1904832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qzUWOJoArvbFLMYaQ8TYwXO2hv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hYSKWDZFFhK82LuJKZaFgVHdBNN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x559ybAzOMmgrHCTztIUxati0R1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
