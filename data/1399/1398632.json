While he kept his personal, professional, and family lives largely separate, his partner Francisco Kripacz, considered the love of his life, designed interiors for many of his projects. The documentary also examines Erickson’s fall from grace in the 1980s and '90s, his struggles during the AIDS crisis that claimed many close to him, and his professional resurgence in his later years.","popularity":0.1368,"poster_path":"/fUgWsVg1YZtYzuTlH8yBEqwpKmn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arthur Erickson: Beauty Between The Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5209383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Erickson","original_name":"Arthur Erickson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Arthur Erickson (self)","credit_id":"67991becba4f941f448f48fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2675250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Mah","original_name":"Ryan Mah","popularity":0.2003,"profile_path":"/28pyjtzP3uEUTiTBLMNZu9qBWLu.jpg","credit_id":"675390183a9c6990b1e479e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3094068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Berish","original_name":"Danny Berish","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753907a84ca928d00ca1aae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34657671","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUgWsVg1YZtYzuTlH8yBEqwpKmn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
