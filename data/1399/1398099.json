At a house party, Paula meets Dr. Smith, who falls in love with her, but a misunderstanding separates them. Unsuccessful in locating the man but knowing that papers in the house of Van Brunt, one of the ring members, will identify the leader, Paula secures the papers with the aid of Old Bill Fitch, a reformed burglar. To her horror, she discovers that the man is Dr. Smith's father. Paula relinquishes vengeance for love, and Dr. Smith's father, realizing the error of his ways, agrees to make reparations.","popularity":0.1831,"poster_path":"/wrB7vcPrYlmEC765v0a1mEGuvTe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vengeance Is Mine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1192601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Castle","original_name":"Irene Castle","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/gHHsxjXFNqpLfHB78odcPVdka8T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paula Farrington","credit_id":"67521f7b84ca928d00c9f5d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Sheridan","original_name":"Frank Sheridan","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/r2QMcX8x5I4irV2oVDZOF7AAkzi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Peter Van Brunt","credit_id":"67521f83fa107dc4ed40408d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Chadwick","original_name":"Helene Chadwick","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/hQ6wcUWMxCRed2DLRTpfutPtnuD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marion De Long","credit_id":"67521f8d84ca928d00c9f5db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Dexter","original_name":"Elliott Dexter","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/A4PeHk6k2qeVN4DjI0VmcxdvDW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Smith","credit_id":"67521f990e8c237986a8f60d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Mason","original_name":"Reginald Mason","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":"/l40LznvlBofVrLv5KBi4xGhdd80.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67521fa637f185620208818c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Grey Terry","original_name":"Ethel Grey Terry","popularity":0.1909,"profile_path":"/fYMETqh7IpasIWZD182kIf3juvA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67521fae72d1a8a59c2996c9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5101193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Monroe","original_name":"Frank Monroe","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pggz2U6xyD1eP7jz7GYe2YvFGjQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67521fbd37f18562020881ab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Stuart","original_name":"Julia Stuart","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/jpCfflR0f7xcdZZgdw3yjMs2G09.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67521fc437f18562020881af","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hoyt","original_name":"Edward Hoyt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67521fa00e8c237986a8f611","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Tiden","original_name":"Fred Tiden","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67521fd737f18562020881c4","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Hall Crane","original_name":"Frank Hall Crane","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/2zd8LQQjBcb01YyJm3EqdxTm4SU.jpg","credit_id":"67521fe537f18562020881cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John A.
