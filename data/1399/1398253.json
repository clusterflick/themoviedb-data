As the forest shrinks and hunting becomes more difficult, Sandi is trying to make sure that the people who still live in the forest can access health and education services. This trend started when Sandi lost two of her children. However, not all Punan Batu communities in the forest welcomed her intentions. In the end, Sandi decided to resign from the position of RT head. Sandi, as a young Punan Batu tribesman who has made peace with the old and modern conditions, aspires for his children to go to school in the city, but his family refuses because of the distance. Sandi, who is worried about the future of Punan Batu, can only hope that the people who still live in the Sajau Benau forest can get proper attention and not disturb the forest.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flintstones Digital of Bulungan Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
