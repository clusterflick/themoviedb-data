Mallory is staying at Little Birdie B&B, run by Robin, a much-loved, long-term resident of Meramec, and her charming son Wren, a former Marine who is partial to his small-town home but finds Mallory’s big-city confidence alluring. Beneath her driven exterior, Mallory’s warm side is revealed as she bonds with the community of Meramec, especially Wren. Zeke, Mallory’s best friend and Hollywood heartthrob, is impulsive, fun, and the life of the party, balancing his stardom with a down-to-earth loyalty to Mallory that challenges her to rethink what she really wants.","popularity":0.4463,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ana Vera Films","origin_country":""},{"id":112797,"logo_path":"/A0YBZCJOgtvmcuZJKoj84Mb4R1q.png","name":"The Ninth House","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"How Hard Can It Be","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":984582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Schafer","original_name":"Anna Schafer","popularity":0.4424,"profile_path":"/AtpZOzp7t6ybvB1bJrSwTJfWTyZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mallory","credit_id":"675346a037f185620208a330","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Kesy","original_name":"Jack Kesy","popularity":0.6268,"profile_path":"/lQ8nUYK6InbCFk2TWNnXjjvG9IY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wren","credit_id":"675346c23494cc9bfbc64201","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":304282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Flannery","original_name":"Kate Flannery","popularity":0.5852,"profile_path":"/wFXWKB2IUyB6Cu08PyovyBAm9WT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Robin","credit_id":"675346dd802bad16091ac335","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Barr","original_name":"Matt Barr","popularity":0.8701,"profile_path":"/ew7lOiIbAW0AxYmh49FH1l1ukkk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zeke","credit_id":"675346f6802bad16091ac346","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Day","original_name":"Michael Day","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675347353494cc9bfbc64248","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marlana Hope","original_name":"Marlana Hope","popularity":0.2106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753475db1eaa5c891db06fd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Klock","original_name":"Jim Klock","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/uP9BqJHWhtLmJ2UEmwSiRp4jpp6.jpg","credit_id":"6753478d37f185620208a373","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":523979,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Autumn Federici","original_name":"Autumn Federici","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/nYA7E8XcoynUmoXUbACwpoL0x04.jpg","credit_id":"67534799b1eaa5c891db0715","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jake Helgren","original_name":"Jake Helgren","popularity":0.2398,"profile_path":"/virgDMoUS8fwCZXcoFchTYdiLgL.jpg","credit_id":"675347a3b1eaa5c891db0719","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
