Shutting himself off from the world around him, he settles in one of the apartments in the house, which only has a television and a collection of videotapes. Spending his days in the secluded environment, his only \"guests\" are the neighbor-woman in the opposite window of the house, the food delivery girl Mon and a dark being whose rare visits are unpredictable and yet closely related to the \"burdens\" the young man brought with him from the past. Over time, trust and affection for the not- so-talkative food delivery girl grows, and the connection between the apparitions in the apartment and Ren's guests becomes more and more obvious. The real begins to merge with the unreal, the stroboscopic fragmentaryness of consciousness drives Ren into a corner and he is forced to find a solution.","popularity":0.1278,"poster_path":"/nAL9S63UIMeFxHyk9ci9Mx0gysW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latvijas Kultūras akadēmija","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Running from the ghosts of his past, Ren takes up with a caterer who  helps him to realise and find a solution to his past reproaches.","title":"Consolation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dāvids Pētersons","original_name":"Dāvids Pētersons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qhtAqDkYA4oIZ76Vev6AAjS1MPx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ren","credit_id":"6753686cf043bd8a6027635c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5103054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alise Anna Naricka","original_name":"Alise Anna Naricka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mon","credit_id":"6753688972d1a8a59c29bd1d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1702174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivars Krasts","original_name":"Ivars Krasts","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/gsscyBPqDAPVSoXTiBGq1zpIIhl.jpg","credit_id":"675368a1f043bd8a6027636c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260974,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Artis Pārups","original_name":"Artis Pārups","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675368bb72d1a8a59c29bd2f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4988611,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anete Mārtuža","original_name":"Anete Mārtuža","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675368d8f043bd8a60276386","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3317671,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Elīna Pērkone","original_name":"Elīna Pērkone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675368f18e033e9136dc93b0","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5103061,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Nadežda Kustova","original_name":"Nadežda Kustova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753691bf043bd8a602763be","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4285990,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paula Jansone","original_name":"Paula Jansone","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67536930f043bd8a602763cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1970185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daiga Livčāne","original_name":"Daiga Livčāne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753694a8e033e9136dc93e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231042,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dace Sloka","original_name":"Dace Sloka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753697737f185620208a776","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uģis Olte","original_name":"Uģis Olte","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/4Q1h86acRgz6B8LFEpPY46WPc0A.jpg","credit_id":"6753698a37f185620208a780","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2231045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Pāss","original_name":"Pēteris Pāss","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675369bcf043bd8a60276420","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4556698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleonora Balode","original_name":"Eleonora Balode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675369eb3494cc9bfbc64778","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5103071,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loreta Livčāne","original_name":"Loreta Livčāne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675369ff3494cc9bfbc6479d","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nAL9S63UIMeFxHyk9ci9Mx0gysW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
