At each step, he observes the world before his eyes, forcing him to fix it and freeze it in an “other” space and time, on the celluloid of his old camera. This man is Kurt Diemberger, climber and filmmaker of high peaks and distant lands. He is 82 years old, but he lives in the \"now\" rather than the past, continually exploring the land beneath his feet, in places dear to him in Austria, Italy and the Dolomites, as if he continued his research through the eye of the camera he uses for the observer.","popularity":0.1963,"poster_path":"/9cH0MIKbkl8bSnuZsqKhBppferY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213880,"logo_path":null,"name":"L’Eubage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurt Diemberger - Verso Dove","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Diemberger","original_name":"Kurt Diemberger","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/hOAwgauVWDVUmvMGITduiR6lG61.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675281ca4624397fa8116f77","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Bich","original_name":"Luca Bich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tEUhcoe91IpMhIrH69z40fEX1Lh.jpg","credit_id":"675280b51234b99a9473fd47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Bich","original_name":"Luca Bich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tEUhcoe91IpMhIrH69z40fEX1Lh.jpg","credit_id":"675280bbab37fcd3e8851fb1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3747374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Enrico Montrosset","original_name":"Enrico Montrosset","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675280c8ab37fcd3e8851fba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2134305,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefano Cravero","original_name":"Stefano Cravero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675280d984ca928d00c9fc79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3954420,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-Michel Petit","original_name":"Jean-Michel Petit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675280e684ca928d00c9fc7d","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3714368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bBGHpoP0IzzRQIW79EWU9KPzASN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pzgvtEKaJp9YruX3go0uM0o4XTX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cH0MIKbkl8bSnuZsqKhBppferY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":4560,"name":"mountaineer"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":160175,"name":"alps mountains"},{"id":343358,"name":"goat alpinist"},{"id":343359,"name":"himalayist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
