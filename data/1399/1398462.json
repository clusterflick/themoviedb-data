That of Monte Rosa and its southern slope  which overlooks wild over Alagna. A journey written over time. The same one that goes into stories and  in the mountains of men; in their homes. The time that lives in traditions, in an ancient  Walser costume worn, as well as in the deep cracks of the highest glaciers. A short story  in honor of the people who live in the mountains, in the mountains. So that I can continue to do so.  Remembering that we are all passing through, but there is something eternal.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/t4mdXNASmFY8Y6zGlOOpNyTngf3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Actionmovie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eterno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Guglielmina","original_name":"Chiara Guglielmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67532e538e033e9136dc8b2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Guglielmina","original_name":"Chiara Guglielmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753306680e5b8f0a7564311","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102489,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matteo Cottardo","original_name":"Matteo Cottardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753307eb1eaa5c891db00bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102492,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marco Orbassano","original_name":"Marco Orbassano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675330c684ca928d00ca0e79","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Guglielmina","original_name":"Chiara Guglielmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675330d6b1eaa5c891db010d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5102489,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matteo Cottardo","original_name":"Matteo Cottardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675330e580e5b8f0a756434c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y5i3KQjFf0BJd7O0NPaWbt5DXD4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t4mdXNASmFY8Y6zGlOOpNyTngf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1980}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Teatro Unione Alagnese","release_date":"2023-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
