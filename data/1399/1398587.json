Focusing on a track-by-track analysis of The Smiths’ seminal 1986 Album “The Queen Is Dead” Laumann’s film adopts the form of a conspiracy-theory-cum-urban-myth, and despite its labyrinthine twists-and turns, seems to make absolute sense: somehow proving its case, suggesting that perhaps Morrissey – albeit aided and abetted by extraterrestrial forces – did indeed possess clairvoyant powers.","popularity":0.2348,"poster_path":"/jaAyBUJyLSyISGNBWen1DyjQ0WR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morrissey Foretelling The Death of Diana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1589032,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lars Laumann","original_name":"Lars Laumann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6753691637f185620208a760","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1589032,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lars Laumann","original_name":"Lars Laumann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67536925f043bd8a602763c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":414041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morrissey","original_name":"Morrissey","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/h4NgzVBnzwWg6LbnmsxXZ6UUcbV.jpg","credit_id":"675369318e033e9136dc93de","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":419327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Marr","original_name":"Johnny Marr","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/vJESfF4XvN99aBXHgoxj1gTrEAj.jpg","credit_id":"67536941678b1834d97b86f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jaAyBUJyLSyISGNBWen1DyjQ0WR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
