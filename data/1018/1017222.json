The focus of the 4-channel video installation is a fictional “Dorothy”. In dreamlike episodes，she recites quotations from the film “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) and the television series “China Beach” (1988-1991) against the background of the Central Vietnamese jungle and in opposition to an overbearing moon. Melhus refers to two events, the 1969 moon landing and the Vietnam War (1955-1975)，which received worldwide media attention.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens if you get used to the End Time?
