Lacking options thanks to her criminal record, Ashleigh concocts a plan to get them jobs at an isolated desert dollar store. As of 2021, dollar stores are the most robbed stores in America thanks to low security, female cashiers, and merchandise that preys on low-income buyers who pay in cash. When the store gets robbed, Ashleigh and Braxton pocket some cash for themselves. But it isnâ€™t enough. Ashleigh and Braxton find themselves luring a criminal on the FBI Most Wanted List to the store. The plan goes haywire, and our heroes must face the consequences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dHuZ1ZcmTdSKAw3efPuAPBgKdq7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nobody robs banks anymore.","title":"Dollar Generals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14604922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dHuZ1ZcmTdSKAw3efPuAPBgKdq7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
