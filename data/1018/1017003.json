For Maria, a well-established, professional Filipino woman, her biggest regret has to do with her relationship with her mother, Gloria. When Maria finds out Gloria has passed away, she is angry that she has been abandoned once again without explanation (just as Gloria did when Maria was a child) - an anger she has carried with her throughout her life. Gloria, on the other hand, is full of regret about all of the decisions she has made regarding Maria - a regret she has carried throughout her life. But given Gloria's situation, was she really to blame?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12344700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
