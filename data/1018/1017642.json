This leads him to choose a path of selfishness and drug abuse. Consequently there's a breakdown of relationships with his family and his wife. When things start to crumble all around him, John gets the wake up call that he needs in the form of a caring new friend, and others in his life that reach out to him in ways they hadn't before. God working through them and reaching out to John, guides him on a path of discovery about where his worth and value truly come from, and what in life is truly valuable.","popularity":0.4832,"poster_path":"/4lJp1L5cQf96zHCn3Nfuc8qJojY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bright Horizon
