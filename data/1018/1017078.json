He also opened his home to the more vulnerable often homeless teenagers, including Leak, thus providing these LGBTQ+ players a safe place to be themselves. After living with Pa Vann for many years, Leak, driven by the pressure to make more money for his family and forced off the football team because of his age, takes the heart-breaking decision to move to Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, leaving behind the one person he loves the most.","popularity":0.1305,"poster_path":"/mVy6uSbVXUC21qlLUgNYO49xgUa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"2022-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lotus Sports Club","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanna Hem","original_name":"Vanna Hem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63086e97dcb6a3008358de41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tommaso Colognese","original_name":"Tommaso Colognese","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63086e8918864b00832853d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16746504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tk2HazuLJ6BkSeh5CPf6oKAIMbJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mVy6uSbVXUC21qlLUgNYO49xgUa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aQSNzIC77JLzxQN6cS21QyIKKh0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Korea Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2023-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
