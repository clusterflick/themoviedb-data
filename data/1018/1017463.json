Far from feeling safer, he soon becomes obsessed with the idea that someone is stalking him, and he connects the signal from the surveillance cameras to the TV in the living room. Progressively, the images of the closed circuit supplant the programs and the movies, until becoming the only thing that is reproduced on the screen. His wife and his children helplessly witness the man's madness... but maybe \"something\" out there is really threatening the family. Something visible only between the pixels of the TV.","popularity":0.2788,"poster_path":"/voKSvLbyNaoDqWOGDM7HNMHeGSv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prointel","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":114310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isla Audiovisual","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El televisor","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Historias para no dormir: \"El televisor\"","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuela Vellés","original_name":"Manuela Vellés","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/tehIQs0SgHA7vNJ3fzPPZ1hO8Mk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Daniela","credit_id":"6309eb8d0398ab00829fde9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Derqui","original_name":"Pablo Derqui","popularity":0.245,"profile_path":"/aqwJOsmnqbigPR5tZ6QFp4Q25XM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marcos","credit_id":"6309eb96c392660082877d34","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3690350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasia Russo","original_name":"Anastasia Russo","popularity":0.5722,"profile_path":"/8RQi40pI2ddocE8S3GbXnpUKZ9S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"636cc7fcf14dad0083998301","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Ortega","original_name":"Esther Ortega","popularity":0.1085,"profile_path":"/1LmXnHrF94SADrMtl3OFLLDYz7g.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"636cc834f14dad0083998319","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaume Balagueró","original_name":"Jaume Balagueró","popularity":0.244,"profile_path":"/geO40SjPO5G7nHn1pRrAGORD7xM.jpg","credit_id":"6309ebb818864b0080e4637a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaume Balagueró","original_name":"Jaume Balagueró","popularity":0.244,"profile_path":"/geO40SjPO5G7nHn1pRrAGORD7xM.jpg","credit_id":"6309ebe7b04228007f4bb259","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alberto Marini","original_name":"Alberto Marini","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/f5HQElD4y1YYE9Oblwib2DIh1sm.jpg","credit_id":"6309ebf6e18b97007bdabd15","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17089,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luis de la Madrid","original_name":"Luis de la Madrid","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b59b3a1d1bf400a0301104","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2592888,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillermo Lorenzana Torns","original_name":"Guillermo Lorenzana Torns","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b59b48875d1a00a02138ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133004,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chicho Ibáñez Serrador","original_name":"Chicho Ibáñez Serrador","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/qinTKbheCdx4vR0ouaPwqarWbdd.jpg","credit_id":"67e151e07d0565af0207ee3a","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18303776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2231,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/voKSvLbyNaoDqWOGDM7HNMHeGSv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1487},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ubYMjdyNBLVAAvBQNOHtzXI9bfl.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/7EUjsgX8TLo9YCN2Xj9t2pNPRAN.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Sitges Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
