The species also disappeared from the Netherlands 150 years ago and it was believed that this was forever. Only small populations survived in the large forests of Eastern Europe. In recent decades, not only did the wolf get legal protection, it also started a remarkable comeback. With time this magnificent animal found its way back from Poland through Germany to the Netherlands and Belgium. The carnivore, around which there are many myths and which is very often portrayed as bloodthirsty, welcomed back by many and despised by others. Are wolves really that dangerous to people? This exceptional documentary follows the journey of a young, lone wolf which grows up in eastern Germany and then head westwards on its search for its own territory and a consort to finally settle down in the Netherlands to found there the first permanent wolf pack since the extermination of the species long time ago.","popularity":0.6969,"poster_path":"/nbCDVEZef0QECyi6kKvsnSUT5oS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216716,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ipsida Wildlife
