While ruminating on his fixed idea, he is disturbed by an intruder, a doctor on vacation like him. The man with a fixed idea (Pierre Arditi) declares \"I felt in a state of inhumanity\", the doctor (Bernard Murat) decked out in all the holidaymaker's accessories: a landing net, an easel and a colored box, comes to invade the morbid loneliness. The importunate debonair begins a conversation that will turn into a philosophical joust where we approach science, Einstein, politics, and the verb. THE MATERIALIST AND THE PHILOSOPHER scrap at speckled foils with the sharpest and most divinely French spirit. Conversation is a balm, an intellectual bandage. The good doctor is a good practitioner and a brave man!","popularity":0.1321,"poster_path":"/fgWyBycOEVU5hiMxsFHXexd41fk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A fixed idea by Paul Valéry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Arditi","original_name":"Pierre Arditi","popularity":0.5328,"profile_path":"/kLvyrJkfcGUKzn3rHI0SYX5uPwj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Moi","credit_id":"6308e5cee18b97007ed0a9a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Murat","original_name":"Bernard Murat","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/gniuqvF49lxzL2JxyAyk1YETAGN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Le Docteur","credit_id":"6308e5dd0398ab007d768b77","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2445651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Valéry","original_name":"Paul Valéry","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/d8J8mbq0FH818myGIjXRRsIW1a5.jpg","credit_id":"6308e641ca7ec6009246fa6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Murat","original_name":"Bernard Murat","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/gniuqvF49lxzL2JxyAyk1YETAGN.jpg","credit_id":"6308e607fdf8b7007d761c2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fgWyBycOEVU5hiMxsFHXexd41fk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
