She is dreaming about going beyond the confines of her urban surroundings, amongst thousands of flickering windows in apartment blocks, to travel somewhere over the rainbow. As she stumbles upon her yellow brick road, a bedside telephone, her communications take her far far away, becoming entangled in her obsession with connecting to this far away place. Swept into a cyclone of dizzying imagery, she becomes somewhat more realized, sceptical about who she is and her dreams. Much like the ubiquity of television, her dreams are nothing more than commodified imagination that has nonetheless shaped her life. In this fairy-tale land, she desperately tries to find her way back home.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/8PlxcKLWrhebHdHmBGqM22R5AUZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far Far Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"6309237db7d3520083aa7f98","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6309236f32489b007e85a8b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63092abfc39266007ac8c0a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8PlxcKLWrhebHdHmBGqM22R5AUZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Weit Weit Weg (Far Far Away), 39 min., 1995","key":"59914936","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-02-18T16:12:33.000Z","id":"6309241032489b009217eba5"}]}}}
