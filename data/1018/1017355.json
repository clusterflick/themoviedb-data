Together, they take an imaginary trip from Sesame Street to the Moon, where they discover how different it is from Earth. One World, One Sky is a brilliant spectacle of light and colour as the furry friends watch the stars twinkle over Sesame Street. Children attending the show can interact as they watch, drawing constellations and counting the time it takes the sun to set. One, World, One Sky is a production of Adler Planetarium, Sesame Workshop, Beijing Planetarium, and Liberty Science Center and was produced with major support from the National Science Foundation.","popularity":0.8665,"poster_path":"/mCACPJaIFzjB3bDYXFJjfxav8l6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One World, One Sky: Big Bird’s Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroll Spinney","original_name":"Caroll Spinney","popularity":0.2904,"profile_path":"/rYn1E9Um326MA1sWCEBlMCFkRGD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Big Bird","credit_id":"6309725385090f008268856c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Clash","original_name":"Kevin Clash","popularity":0.3547,"profile_path":"/yZ5EdQQvjifJ0hLh8CU7Ug7kz1e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elmo","credit_id":"6309728018864b008328a977","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Bunch","original_name":"Tyler Bunch","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/h9uxOioFww3lcf2ttG8IqF0m765.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hu Hu Zhu","credit_id":"630972a9b3e627007d44c2d3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3678236,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie Evans","original_name":"Annie Evans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63097311b7d3520083aa93e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Diego","original_name":"Ken Diego","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67533908516edeab29994d13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6144192","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mCACPJaIFzjB3bDYXFJjfxav8l6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"English ","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
