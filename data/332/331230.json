Kaliardáwas the secret language of the homosexual community in Greece, from the 40s until the first years following the fall of the dictatorship in the mid-70s. Paola became acquainted with the use of kaliardá towards its end, in the 80s. We started out with an aim to record the history of kaliardá, but along the way we realized we were recording the history of the homosexual community in Greece during the twentieth century. Themes started emerging, such as love, sexuality, hangouts, problems faced by people at the time and how conditions gradually changed. In the documentary, we speak with academics and people from the street who have first-hand experience of our topic.","popularity":0.0587,"poster_path":"/dQv9swkZvNKQGSRDTcHzkysZPgg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaliarda","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1441588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Revenioti","original_name":"Πάολα Ρεβενιώτη","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/ly6IgW8uewWcjHScQDkmITpivYb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(Herself)","credit_id":"65f8465e903c52017e29f25b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1441588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Revenioti","original_name":"Πάολα Ρεβενιώτη","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/ly6IgW8uewWcjHScQDkmITpivYb.jpg","credit_id":"5508b207c3a36856ce00071f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5065320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3So8j9sjNwJ5zGIGj6UuxrQpPOS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQv9swkZvNKQGSRDTcHzkysZPgg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
