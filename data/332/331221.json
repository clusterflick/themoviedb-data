A man and woman guide us on this trip, taking us past gently falling Mondrian paintings, violent car crashes and bombing raids, and a pair of dancing, multicolored boxes, among many other settings. Based on an improvised performance, 'Suggestive Gestures' leads us gradually and indirectly towards a mysterious animal, hiding in the center of the maze.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lake Ivan Performance Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suggestive Gestures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55089133c3a3682b4c001d54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441554,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cassie Tunick","original_name":"Cassie Tunick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5508914992514130b400197d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5508923cc3a36856ce000510","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5508924b92514110da001ce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55089258c3a36856ce000514","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441554,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cassie Tunick","original_name":"Cassie Tunick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5508926892514110d7001b5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5508927a92514110dd001ce4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5508928e92514110dd001ce6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550892a69251413c71000512","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550892bdc3a3682b4c001d7c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Finkelstein","original_name":"David Finkelstein","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550892ccc3a3682b43001b1d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2898884","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
