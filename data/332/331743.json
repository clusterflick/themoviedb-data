Packard left town in 1954, but the plant still stands as a symbol of decay. The half-mile stretch of rubble and ruin tells a story of failed politics and criminal activity, of scrappers and arsonists who went too far, and of the perseverance of one business to stick it out. The lawless plant has become a haven for street artists and curiosity seekers from around the world, including a developer from Peru.","popularity":0.5779,"poster_path":"/4zpWudb3MioO2cJhbwPepTPRjCh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Detroit Free Press","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Packard: The Last Shift","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1743861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celeste Headlee","original_name":"Celeste Headlee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bcwXPyUoKfrG3JLtyH9yPd1Fi2z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"58857b4e925141322300172a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Levine","original_name":"Philip Levine","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64851977c9dbf900ad460441","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Palazuelo","original_name":"Fernando Palazuelo","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64852eceb6c264011ecd9619","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Kaufman","original_name":"Brian Kaufman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58857ab5c3a3684d5a00198b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathy Kieliszewski","original_name":"Kathy Kieliszewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58857ad5c3a3684d6000146e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Kaufman","original_name":"Brian Kaufman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58857ae8c3a3684d6d0017f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richie Hawtin","original_name":"Richie Hawtin","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/40s0ZQBGrn9LjidRymimFM2vnt3.jpg","credit_id":"6485194bb6c26400c7f15392","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Kaufman","original_name":"Brian Kaufman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64852f92e272600107226ce3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Kaufman","original_name":"Brian Kaufman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64852f7ae375c00139c05d7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3981692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/soi9om77qEFQI4FJkoxVuzOlGny.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDeFdiNDj9mopJ5MQZrY9uBiemA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4zpWudb3MioO2cJhbwPepTPRjCh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u1TEeyV3g4cTummzjlrlt9wSKvc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163919,"name":"manufacturing"},{"id":181579,"name":"auto industry"},{"id":286354,"name":"cars"},{"id":303205,"name":"detroit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Freep Film Festival, Detroit","release_date":"2014-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Freep Film Festival (again)","release_date":"2015-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Packard: The Last Shift (extended trailer)","key":"76144774","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-04T13:48:33.000Z","id":"6485135fd2b20900ca1f649d"}]}}}
