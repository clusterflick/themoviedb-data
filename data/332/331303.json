From 1971 to 1987, and over the course of twelve series and eight specials, The Two Ronnies was one of the nation's favourite television comedy shows. The show was practically an institution, with Christmas and Easter holidays only really being complete for most families, with a Two Ronnies special. This compilation features favourite sketches from sixteen years of the much-loved and much-missed programme, including:  * The Vagaband Lover (before he died of drink, women and horses)  * Swedish Made Simple  * Mastermind (answering the question before last) and  * The St. Botolph's Country Dance Team","popularity":0.1216,"poster_path":"/aB7FiwyOhRPWH7yBOhOSH3Xh7P1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Two Ronnies","title":"The Best Of The Two Ronnies - Volume 1","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Barker","original_name":"Ronnie Barker","popularity":0.257,"profile_path":"/n7Ngv3HrOnYlIpykoe6WzgtO1gV.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58e75466925141354c011c1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Corbett","original_name":"Ronnie Corbett","popularity":0.2571,"profile_path":"/nAaP1oQQ9tLC4enD8m9x6KWXfic.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58e7546dc3a368730204ac94","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ae77bmxejHKC1UrlJ8Qvfd5A8bR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aB7FiwyOhRPWH7yBOhOSH3Xh7P1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
