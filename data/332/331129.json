It follows the original tale rather closely, though a few variations of the legend do exist. The essence of each of the variations is more or less the same: Radin Mas Ayu is the baby daughter of Pangeran (brother of the Sultan of Java) and a court dancer; she is forced to go on exile to Temasek with his father after the Sultan disagrees with her parents' marriage and burns their house down, killing her mother. Radin Mas Ayu grows up to be a pious and filial daughter, but is despised out of jealousy by her stepmother. She eventually sacrifices herself as she shields her father from a murderous attack.","popularity":0.1529,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay-Keris Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raden Mas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nordin Ahmad","original_name":"Nordin Ahmad","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":"/5e0ctiamhQvPSYpSDLOGkgfmjVq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"561c6ad99251415a64002965","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latifah Omar","original_name":"Latifah Omar","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/k7xIeREOi72zep8IbX4zAUqFKak.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"561c6aeac3a3682256002dc4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.
