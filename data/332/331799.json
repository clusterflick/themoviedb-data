Between 1934 and 1939, the Land Settlement Association (LSA) established 1,100 smallholdings within 26 settlements across the country, the objective of which was to re-settle unemployed workers and their families (mainly miners at Oxcroft) and get them working and producing on the land.  The film examines ideas of food production, environment and community through the eyes of current residents, some of whom moved onto the estate at its inception in 1936 as the children of original settlers and have never left.","popularity":0.3888,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Junction Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Settlers in England","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1442819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ian Nesbitt","original_name":"Ian Nesbitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550ce6d19251413443002463","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1442819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ian Nesbitt","original_name":"Ian Nesbitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550ce6e3c3a3684872004d65","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1442819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ian Nesbitt","original_name":"Ian Nesbitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550ce6f1c3a3684874005039","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1442819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ian Nesbitt","original_name":"Ian Nesbitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550ce71dc3a3684883004b06","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1442820,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Frankie Shakarian","original_name":"Frankie Shakarian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550ce742c3a3684883004b0b","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1442822,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hannah Short","original_name":"Hannah Short","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550ce753c3a3684872004d7c","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11004,"name":"rural area"},{"id":158431,"name":"united kingdom"},{"id":182278,"name":"farming community"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
