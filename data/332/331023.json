In the future of our dreams, there lurks a villain from our nightmares. Matt Mercury and his Rocket Rangers encounter a mutant super-genius, called Professor Brainwave, who is on a mission to steal the Earth. Brainwave is from a mysterious region of space, known as the Alpha Zone and he is under the control of a giant one-eyed brain called the Galactic Mastermind. Mercury is more concerned about the affections of his half human, half house cat girlfriend, Mulkress Dunner. Pressure builds on Mercury when Mulkress is kidnapped, along with the Earth. Will Dr. Syfer's robotic Lima Beans save the day? Can a cranky robot, an ape scientist, an inarticulate Cyclops, a molten man in an iron mask, a self-absorbed battleship Captain, an eight-year-old boy or a disaffected girl side-kick do any better? Will Matt, see justice prevail... or at least get a call back from his girlfriend?","popularity":0.3093,"poster_path":"/auR4llcK8wpzjRPDMWRvJm86o9s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Tex Movin' Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matt Mercury, Plot of the Galactic Mastermind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Lavine","original_name":"Matt Lavine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Matt Mercury","credit_id":"65ef9aab0e29a2017b36f982","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bounds","original_name":"Eric Bounds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Nemo","credit_id":"65ef9ac78b959e0130e3f44d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4586681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Hughes","original_name":"Bill Hughes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Professor Brainwave","credit_id":"65ef9b41946318018560502a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curt Clendenin","original_name":"Curt Clendenin","popularity":0.2492,"profile_path":"/vpRZqKk0CcVmaK4qG45gOVGBlrW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Max Neptune","credit_id":"66fc0fd6061afe114bf186ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4802053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shontel Cosby","original_name":"Shontel Cosby","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66fc10058aa734b376a68cd9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Corrigan","original_name":"Rick Corrigan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Syfer","credit_id":"66fc103a4955b4a206f18c97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1493346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Drexler","original_name":"Doug Drexler","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Drex McCloud","credit_id":"66fc107d4955b4a206f18caa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3893177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Galley","original_name":"Lauren Galley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sparx McCoy","credit_id":"66fc10a06ec7804796d64cb1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Hughes","original_name":"Bill Hughes","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Professor Brainwave","credit_id":"66fc10ed9b1f9121abd64cb4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roc Living","original_name":"Roc Living","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/1VpZlwOsSQbYXyr1TQuncsXFBqp.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jett Lightning","credit_id":"66fc119602e2e3fa4aa67683","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mister Lobo","original_name":"Mister Lobo","popularity":0.1295,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Hologram Mr. Lobo","credit_id":"66fc11bc8aa734b376a68d69","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2926787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Pentecost","original_name":"Brandon Pentecost","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"66fc11ee411656c0e4f18a5f","order":11}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2230916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/auR4llcK8wpzjRPDMWRvJm86o9s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":2850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKJQjaifDdCLahXfvS2IDxSJ2dc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
