Director Steven Spielberg, author Michael Crichton, actor Jeff Goldblum, and a host of scientific experts answer this compelling question in the award-winning Nova documentary, The Real Jurassic Park. Behind-the-scenes clips, interviews, and demonstrations with leading paleontologists investigate the viability of reviving the extinct species. All phases of logistics are addressed, including extracting prehistoric insect DNA, creating embryos for placement in host eggs, and more. The scientific analysis of the process leads to the examination of the ethics of recreating a vanished life form.","popularity":0.9819,"poster_path":"/vdH1Gk5V5R9cXILsoLmYol6OYLW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6773,"logo_path":"/thh8BxybjvOoI618djeXzwhGfh4.png","name":"NOVA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Jurassic Park","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Goldblum","original_name":"Jeff Goldblum","popularity":3.3862,"profile_path":"/o3PahuK7OmCI0RAQUq38CUBWYZ9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"550e2053c3a3683f0a000816","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":196507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Dugan","original_name":"David Dugan","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550e20f2925141073d0008d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":196507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Dugan","original_name":"David Dugan","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550e20fb92514107010008ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":196507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Dugan","original_name":"David Dugan","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550e21039251413554005ac5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2652568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vdH1Gk5V5R9cXILsoLmYol6OYLW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1719,"name":"paleontology"},{"id":12616,"name":"dinosaur"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"1993-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
