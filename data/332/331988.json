They're soon led astray by two young men who take them on an urban canoe ride through the downtown canals. As they make their way back to the post office, Irene and Paula are repeatedly diverted by a variety of encounters, sidewalk spectacles, and reminiscences of past adventures. TAX DAY follows their vacation around town, in an ode to getting out into the world, and to the pleasures of a lost afternoon.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tax Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Colella","original_name":"Laura Colella","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550e34339251410701000e74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0163867","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
