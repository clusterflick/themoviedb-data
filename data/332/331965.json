Only fourteen minutes long, Untitled is uncut, rejecting the implications of edited sequences and also purposefully excluding subtitles over the couple's conversation. The style of the film confronts the history of ethnography as a controversial study of the \"other\" by refusing us any clear messages or meanings behind what is being presented, challenging the viewer to come up with their own answers to any questions that may arise.","popularity":0.3571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stephanie Spray","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2010-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Spray","original_name":"Stephanie Spray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550def7c92514146a0006e60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Spray","original_name":"Stephanie Spray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550def87c3a3684872007659","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Spray","original_name":"Stephanie Spray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550def93c3a3684877006e60","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":204233,"name":"ethnographical"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
