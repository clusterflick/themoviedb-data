But before this current wave of fancy shops, mortgage priced bikes, and superstar builders came to light, the chopper subculture was (and still is) heralded by the home-builder. The true essence lies with the guy that works a full day, comes home and then builds in his garage. The guy that turns out a killer custom with limited time, tooling, and resources. This movie pays homage the home bike builder and explores the undergound chopper scene.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Choppahead Volume 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
