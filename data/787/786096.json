My problem is a problem of a woman (1979) is the culmination and the turning point of a process which began with Change in 1974. The latter was an action in which the artist had half of her face aged using make-up and immortalized in a portrait posted in the streets of Warsaw. Up to that point, Partum had used make-up to glamorize herself, signing various words with her lips outlined in red and pressed against paper as she spoke 1. But in Change. My problem is a problem of a woman, Partum had wrinkles, varicose veins, and grey hair applied over half of her body while, reclining on a white podium, she recited passages from the critic Lucy Lippard and the artist VALIE EXPORT.","popularity":0.0427,"poster_path":"/v8mNN2PMVFs9BdVAs6FQPtI4PDb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Change.
