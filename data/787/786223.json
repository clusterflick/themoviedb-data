The way in which each room is occupied individually stands in contrast to the chamber maids' daily experience of cleaning countless rooms, all of them identical in design and appearance. In a field of tension between the chamber maids' work and their knowledge of the short-term inhabitants of the rooms the film visualizes an aspect of daily life which is often experienced but rarely reflected.","popularity":0.0663,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Housekeeping","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Mascha","original_name":"Michael Mascha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b4e7d5db5003cccfce8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b6ddb952d0040d34dd1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Mascha","original_name":"Michael Mascha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b7d7390c0003df72d82","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937183,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karin Helml","original_name":"Karin Helml","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b5ebe4b36003f510f84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Mascha","original_name":"Michael Mascha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b577d5db5003bcdea76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Mascha","original_name":"Michael Mascha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b47db952d0040d34da2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867296,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susanne Thomas","original_name":"Susanne Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60016b75cb3084003dd79316","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
