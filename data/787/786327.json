With the help of interviews with historians and railroad experts, legends and folklore are explored as well as the mechanics and maintenance of locomotives. The collection of working locomotives in Pennsylvania's Amish country are particularly fun to see maintained and operated under 19th-century conditions. Special segments include passenger train history, the Pacific Railroad Act, commuter train operations, and the controls on Amtrak's EMD 103 super locomotive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Trains of America: Eastern Railroading","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
