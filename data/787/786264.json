In the foreground stand five people whose lives have been taken many different directions because of Aids. They tell of the experiences which they or others have had with the disease. The \"topic\" is not the important thing, rather the situation in which the environment confronts one with resistance - often enough in the form of negative experiences - rather than mysteries. These experiences do not require definition or inclusion in a discussion which demands distance between the way of considering and the concept of the disease.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":133338,"logo_path":null,"name":"LOOP TV-Video-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1993-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vom Leben Lieben Sterben","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Benner","original_name":"Walter Benner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"600189ea223e200040b341c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Holoubek","original_name":"Brigitte Holoubek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"600189f56aa8e0004077ee27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Müller","original_name":"Irene Müller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"600189fadb952d003ed37b6a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Paar","original_name":"Ernst Paar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"600189ffc0348b003c359ff5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Reder","original_name":"Wolfgang Reder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"60018a04420228003eea7268","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Hiller","original_name":"Walter Hiller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60018993c99826003c9fd331","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Neuwirth","original_name":"Manfred Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mgxc4ejAmB3Jnqa6b3K0ZxwjwtJ.jpg","credit_id":"6001899b6aa8e0003f77ce70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Neuwirth","original_name":"Manfred Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mgxc4ejAmB3Jnqa6b3K0ZxwjwtJ.jpg","credit_id":"600189a2c99826003da04662","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Hiller","original_name":"Walter Hiller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600189a9326c19003f80bf93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Neuwirth","original_name":"Manfred Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mgxc4ejAmB3Jnqa6b3K0ZxwjwtJ.jpg","credit_id":"600189af719aeb0044431b98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Hiller","original_name":"Walter Hiller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600189b690cf51003d51b976","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Neuwirth","original_name":"Manfred Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mgxc4ejAmB3Jnqa6b3K0ZxwjwtJ.jpg","credit_id":"600189bcc0348b003d36b3eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerda Lampalzer","original_name":"Gerda Lampalzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600189c47390c0003df74b18","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867091,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Curd Duca","original_name":"Curd Duca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600189cc719aeb0044431bc3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Neuwirth","original_name":"Manfred Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mgxc4ejAmB3Jnqa6b3K0ZxwjwtJ.jpg","credit_id":"600189dec0348b003d36b3fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0108503","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Viennale","release_date":"1993-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
