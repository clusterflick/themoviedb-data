Paradise is called San Pigro and is situated on the border of the Carribbean. The natives call their island the “island of the lazy”, as even the mangos weigh up to two kilos. And if you‘re still hungry, you just crack open a fresh coconut at the beach. After he ruptures a cruciate ligament, the unemployed BMX pro Pete knows exactly where he‘s heading. And Rico, his Reeperbahn friend with a criminal record, is easily convinced of the prospect of never having to work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dPVUt2gmM5MY8VrLQ0R6XqdaXDX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pete the Heat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1592777","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dPVUt2gmM5MY8VrLQ0R6XqdaXDX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
