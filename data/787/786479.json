A young man accompanies her to show the way but when they arrive at the graveyard, Tuty lets out such a fearsome laugh that the young man runs away in fear. Tutyâ€™s laugh sounds like a kuntilanak (Indonesian version of banshee). Iskak, who also hears the freakish sound, flees at once. The news about kuntilanak spreads. But it is Tuty who has the last laugh. She snares a new boyfriend, a reporter assigned to cover the news.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":147467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rita & Rina Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1961-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuntilanak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2938117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tien Rostini","original_name":"Tien Rostini","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tuty","credit_id":"60025037719aeb004444a4cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddy Sud","original_name":"Eddy Sud","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/bjRKIxrtpe6OKTc5Vm0YoPljKNr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6002501f2f7915003c9a1ff0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1690732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iskak","original_name":"Iskak","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/ovik9ppVPTnKLm5lIAueN7U4Gbl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Iskak","credit_id":"600250267390c0003df891bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.
