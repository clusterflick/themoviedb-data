But as the temperatures rose, three-quarters of these species died out. What happened? Can environmental changes alone really explain this mass extinction, or did humans - who at this very time were beginning their conquest of the planet - play a key role? To find out, researchers around the world are hunting and studying fossils in their search for answers to solve the mystery of the Ice Age giants.","popularity":0.5894,"poster_path":"/qdvKzcI9hasweX2VTXdDMy4XRIw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bilderfest","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":84339,"logo_path":"/xHTkcQihsN49kgVZNWEHT4omGym.png","name":"ZDF
