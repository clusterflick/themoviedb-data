The film relates the story of the distinguished Latgalian poet Anna Rancāne and her family – her daughter Terēze, her grandson Daniel, and Daniel’s father, Dara Muhammad Ali – who are trying to stick together despite unfortunate circumstances. Even though Terēze and Anna are Catholic, while Dara is a Muslim from Kurdistan, their love transcends religious, national and cultural prejudice. However, due to circumstances beyond their control, the family is not destined to remain together, despite doing everything they can to stay close.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/nA39DIzEl4hUy2ng0dATJEjVy9Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Devini","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prayer for a Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ināra Kolmane","original_name":"Ināra Kolmane","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/74CJ7nfEt9bB4Q4ax4xkUaum6Fx.jpg","credit_id":"6001ed1f7390c0003ef8ed60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2350477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nora Ikstena","original_name":"Nora Ikstena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ed3b1c635b004feef7b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uldis Jancis","original_name":"Uldis Jancis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ed53a9b9a4003f862111","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2874104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asnāte Rībena","original_name":"Asnāte Rībena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ed68c99826003ca070aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","original_name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001ed94db952d003dd428fe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2026526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","original_name":"Jānis Juhņevičs","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001eda17390c0003bf88860","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mārtiņš Miļevskis","original_name":"Mārtiņš Miļevskis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6001edbc7d5db5003dce6378","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2231045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Pāss","original_name":"Pēteris Pāss","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6775deb16234c1b46f61a2e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nA39DIzEl4hUy2ng0dATJEjVy9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
