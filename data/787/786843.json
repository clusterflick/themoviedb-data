His days are kept as simple as the loaf of bread he makes every morning; the first slice his breakfast, the last slice his dessert--this gives him a \"sense of closure for the day.\" On the verge of jumping he finds a tumor on his neck. Through this new found bad news he gets the strength to talk to Claire, another patient of his psychiatrist's. Claire, a beautiful stripper with a badly stained childhood lets her male guard down and lets Brian in. In order to protect Claire, Brian gets involved with a motley crew of gangsters, faces his fears and gains the will to live... but is it too late?","popularity":1.0543,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life on the Ledge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2939295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Helfer","original_name":"Lewis Helfer","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Brian","credit_id":"6003a8f87390c0003cfcf459","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Sagemiller","original_name":"Melissa Sagemiller","popularity":0.6789,"profile_path":"/s8JEuWY5wnrm5D0uZCh9ezYztx6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"6003a90f719aeb003d4622ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tovah Feldshuh","original_name":"Tovah Feldshuh","popularity":0.7213,"profile_path":"/c0VOkTP88UneW37YOBebtBhMHYF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6003a927cb3084003edd47c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Blum","original_name":"Mark Blum","popularity":0.4739,"profile_path":"/xJ9pudGFNrmkD2Lkn4rEYBUCjV2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Father","credit_id":"6003a934e8d0b4003e2b4e67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Reynolds","original_name":"Jacob Reynolds","popularity":0.3164,"profile_path":"/zyhqlnG7KfPR9MRw1ptkjXzNd0R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Donnie","credit_id":"6003a946420228003eee05d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irma St. Paule","original_name":"Irma St. Paule","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/qtJmKcPHbTyveOE2NhLcsU04KUF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"64a591d41bf2660105183b6f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2939295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Helfer","original_name":"Lewis Helfer","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6003a98f904f6d003fc30c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2939295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Helfer","original_name":"Lewis Helfer","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6003a9996aa8e0003f7b1162","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
