Sākums","overview":"Choosing the fate of a rock musician was similar to being a dissident. From the 60s, the Soviet Union tried to discourage and restrict the expansion of rock music by any means. They called it the “rotten fruit of degraded capitalism, demoralizing the minds of Soviet youth”. Despite that, rock music broke the wall – made a hole in the Iron Curtain – and gained the hearts and minds of tens of thousands of young people.Rock musicians were on the frontline of the rebellion against the Soviet regime. Despite censorship, they managed to deliver, in a hidden, roundabout way through lyrics and music, the spirit of nonconformity and freedom of choice to their audience. A film about Latvian and Soviet rock pioneers, their lives and destinies.","popularity":0.584,"poster_path":"/8XqJfZeas6pD3nR2EJ9H7cLcm8l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Vision","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first film in the trilogy about the history of rock music in Latvia","title":"Rockin' Down The Curtain: The 60ies.
