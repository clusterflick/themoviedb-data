And while some South Side neighborhoods might seem defined by how much things stay the same, most demonstrate how much in Chicago continuously evolves.\r Explore some of the South Side’s neighborhoods and their stories.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicago's South Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Baer","original_name":"Geoffrey Baer","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/yR1vMIXjkIMpI6jDFUGNEqgzJER.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself/Host","credit_id":"6001deac719aeb004443c374","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
