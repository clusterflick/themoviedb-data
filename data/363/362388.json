Aided by mysterious benefactors, he must delve beneath the city into a modern labyrinth of gutters whose tendrils have grown deep while he was gone. What unfolds is a desperate tale of brute force tragedy set in the supernatural underworld of Chicago, where heroes are reduced to horror-shows, villains dream of their own demise, and good and evil prove to be antiquated concepts.","popularity":0.1848,"poster_path":"/lTL5lqOxrRLS1lslJPmFtlxDuvd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dakini
