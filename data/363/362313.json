Young Carlos faces the forgetfulness of old Carlos, who doesn't recognize his own appearance. They get a package. But the package seems odd. The knot that ties, the smell, the handwriting on the envelope: this could only be sent by his father, Ernesto, who has been dead for many years. A father who always created unusual situations. In this time warp, Carlos is split in two: one Carlos remembers and the other forgets the moments he spent with his father.","popularity":0.504,"poster_path":"/cUe78tCYn26SJKvSSSopXMNz2XV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinossaurus
