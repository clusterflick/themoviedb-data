He gives the thief a chance to return it by putting an empty box on a table and turning out the lights. When the lights are turned back on the box is gone, and the district attorney has a knife in his back and is quite dead. The police and the coroner arrive. There are several attempts made on the life of the coroner. Ruth Whitman is found hiding in a grandfather-clock, holding the gem box. She claims the box was pushed into her hands and she was pushed into the clock. The district attorney's butler/valet tells the coroner he saw who killed his employer and a few minutes later he is also murdered. The mystery deepens.","popularity":0.9467,"poster_path":"/9lcAvLNLwpKAMOZwyTHkDGbV2Km.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You'd Be Surprised","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Griffith","original_name":"Raymond Griffith","popularity":0.0815,"profile_path":"/5cEBptaTW0zhi9rh7XKq4bPpwsa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Green","credit_id":"5610fed1c3a368680b0119ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Martindel","original_name":"Edward Martindel","popularity":0.1934,"profile_path":"/6UHRDttqYAVIA9wtp5tRwObr8Uo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. White","credit_id":"5610fde8925141061500498e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Williams","original_name":"Earle Williams","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/h8NOjETlZvKzVeRp5uAalEoPOu3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Black","credit_id":"5610fdf2c3a368680b01199b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom McGuire","original_name":"Tom McGuire","popularity":0.4054,"profile_path":"/gEi4brY4vNuG8gTwpdtnTkxIfnI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Inspector Brown","credit_id":"5610fdfe9251410d80003d73","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Sebastian","original_name":"Dorothy Sebastian","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/3soMuXtGrf2v4haxG07xLNd94Wd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5610fe089251410615004993","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1518443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Granville Redmond","original_name":"Granville Redmond","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/wHzkZ1bXrNOhrZXzaUxz714xo4J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Grey â€“ a Valet","credit_id":"5610fedac3a3686819010efc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Arlen","original_name":"Richard Arlen","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/dDr230NdMlxt4BC0OxwG0pJZV7t.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Reporter (uncredited)","credit_id":"5610ff0d925141478d0085e6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Collins Sr.","original_name":"Monte Collins Sr.","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/8xPnbXwfjEtNm4Rmc3mAnBXy7ip.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Milkman \"Juror\" (uncredited)","credit_id":"593d954992514105b70218de","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe Karns","original_name":"Roscoe Karns","popularity":0.2759,"profile_path":"/eDXhkieC1icm4lGnuDziIIl5nO8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Party Guest (uncredited)","credit_id":"5610ff27c3a3686810011e06","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Keith","original_name":"Isabelle Keith","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/w7smwshGFGuDG3lHO8WYf6KhHVn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Party Guest (uncredited)","credit_id":"5610ff3092514147d8008549","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick La Reno","original_name":"Dick La Reno","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"\"Jury\" Foreman (uncredited)","credit_id":"678769119c6c37987b7af0f0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl M.
