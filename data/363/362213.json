Four hundred years later, however, this treaty – among many others – has not been honoured and a strong Indigenous mobilization is rising across North America in reaction. Maracle’s formidable documentary revisits this agreement and examines the Indigenous response to this broken agreement.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grandfather of All Treaties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Candace Maracle","original_name":"Candace Maracle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"560dc11c9251413f09001157","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
