Retrograde Premonition looks and sounds like floating mind, the vicissitudes of thought, feeling, and the senses. Not limited by the portrayal of actual events, this video works to encourage a roaming consciousness through images and sounds that may or may not be present. Pierce shoots these videos with a digital still camera hand held at long exposures and then weaves the stills into video shots. Each individual image bears the mark of time from motion blur, a blur that may in fact contradict the apparent motion of the frame. He composes the entire sound scape once picture editing is complete.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retrograde Premonition","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leighton Pierce","original_name":"Leighton Pierce","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/yPQEX7xbdJmVN49JtQ8TV62RjiU.jpg","credit_id":"560da0a29251413f09000cc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1720208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
