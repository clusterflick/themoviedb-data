Taking place shortly before the resumption of Japanese sovereignty over Okinawa, Takamine’s film tacitly addresses the island prefecture's complicated history of occupation and feelings of dislocation through the story of a small community and its preparations for a wedding between a local girl and a Japanese teacher. On the periphery of these events is Reishu (Kaoru Kobayashi), who quits his job on a US military base and uses the extra time to catch snakes and play with ants – and get the bride-to-be pregnant. Takamine’s leisurely-paced film is full of uniquely Okinawan touches that mix in aspects of the island's folklore, accompanied by Haruomi Hosono’s spare and evocative score.","popularity":0.5699,"poster_path":"/mqstyFsKmNP5T1u4DNqXXFDlopR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise View","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Paradaisu Byû","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaoru Kobayashi","original_name":"小林薫","popularity":0.8178,"profile_path":"/pJSt6nRgcIsli0hw2aOCzc2l622.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reishu Goya","credit_id":"5610bb5cc3a3686810011304","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1433795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Togawa","original_name":"Jun Togawa","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":"/9gJXBLhZs4NJzalNEAqNwaDFu4s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chiru","credit_id":"5610bb75c3a368682400fd93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Haruomi Hosono","original_name":"細野晴臣","popularity":0.2829,"profile_path":"/xcyfoBn0zSMiXcSTezPGmoOWZsK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ito","credit_id":"5610bbeec3a3686817010f40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1414847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomi Taira","original_name":"平良とみ","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/jXvQDNKX2DsVu0NApFGK4TAG1c6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4638510f2fbd0fa0eea2cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2378152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saburo Kitamura","original_name":"Saburo Kitamura","popularity":0.0477,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4638a4a0be280455a2ee2b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gō Takamine","original_name":"高嶺剛","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/ok3yPK5ZqQ8BNd5KDpZyNRvaPng.jpg","credit_id":"5610bb36c3a3686814011f89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Haruomi Hosono","original_name":"細野晴臣","popularity":0.2829,"profile_path":"/xcyfoBn0zSMiXcSTezPGmoOWZsK.jpg","credit_id":"56189280925141375d001431","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gō Takamine","original_name":"高嶺剛","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/ok3yPK5ZqQ8BNd5KDpZyNRvaPng.jpg","credit_id":"5a04b9fc9251416afa005117","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228699","wikidata_id":"Q11329349","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zTwMY8oUkc9gjtqFd5zrPknXLQx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1022,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/2rH6kXKik1zivCmpKqtyqLdPXRq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mqstyFsKmNP5T1u4DNqXXFDlopR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8676,"name":"okinawa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
