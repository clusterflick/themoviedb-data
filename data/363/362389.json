The viewer meets local visual artist Dan Hudson as he ruminates on the very mountains that define his lifestyle, and inspires his artistic expression.  The film tracks the artist as he shoots skiers and snowboarders on the mountain and then into his studio as nature becomes muse and inspiration flows both ways, translating to canvas.","popularity":0.2801,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sherpas Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sculpted in Time: The Artist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518100,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Hudson","original_name":"Dan Hudson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5610212192514147d8006644","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Hjertaas","original_name":"Kevin Hjertaas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56102126c3a368681900ef7d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keegan Capel","original_name":"Keegan Capel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"561021299251414feb006158","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rauri MacFarlane","original_name":"Rauri MacFarlane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"561021359251415e5300363f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Maisonet","original_name":"Noah Maisonet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5610213f925141061500296e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Wittstock","original_name":"Drew Wittstock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"561021489251410615002973","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Mossop","original_name":"Dave Mossop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561021a19251415e53003646","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314469,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacob Yoffee","original_name":"Jacob Yoffee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/e39EVNCC8q9j0epLzIYI6dkJxOK.jpg","credit_id":"561024abc3a368680b00f97e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Mossop","original_name":"Dave Mossop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56102197c3a368681700fa13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Sangster","original_name":"Malcolm Sangster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561022c4c3a368681000fdd7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Trusler","original_name":"Jay Trusler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561024e292514147d800669d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Trusler","original_name":"Jay Trusler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561023179251414feb006184","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Mossop","original_name":"Dave Mossop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561023039251410d80001cb0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518095,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Symes","original_name":"Tim Symes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561024cfc3a368680b00f981","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Trusler","original_name":"Jay Trusler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561021fa9251415e5300364d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4352434","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195732,"name":"ski"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
