The DVD discusses the process of recreating the partially lost opera for its first performance in nearly 70 years. Director Robert Benedetti narrates the film as a documentary on the recreation process and as a guide to the surreal plot of the opera itself. A stage performance of the opera (translated into English) comprises the bulk of the film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victory Over the Sun: A Recreation of the 1913 Performance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1519495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Benedetti","original_name":"Robert Benedetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561412999251410d8000b47b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
