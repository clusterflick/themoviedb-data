As the regime begins to slightly relax its iron grip, the island begins to slowly open up to the world. Despite the economic hardship, a life full of passion, temperament and energy still pulsates in Cuban cities. Food is rationed and decent living conditions is an illusion for many. The dreams of today’s senior citizens, who believed in Fidel and his communist experiment 50 years ago, have not been fully realized. Children of these revolutionaries still follow the ideals of the revolution but do not seem all that convinced. Instead young people prefer to enjoy small pleasures the regime allows for. While many Cubans look for life outside of Cuba, for tourists the island is for many reasons very special destination. Motherland or Death is the story of real life played out against the picturesque background of today’s Cuba.","popularity":0.1138,"poster_path":"/yEjKlj2wWPh8PZTVbMsH4sPbYQ3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motherland or Death","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Patria O Muerte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vitaly Mansky","original_name":"Виталий Манский","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/lfuKoHM7F4SKjnQjQWoO6yUM8jg.jpg","credit_id":"599a77ac92514151ad008cb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2005330","wikidata_id":"Q17582656","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yEjKlj2wWPh8PZTVbMsH4sPbYQ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
