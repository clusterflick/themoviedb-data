What happens when collective trauma enters a family? A story told from the personal point of view of the filmmaker who experienced the war in many layers: intimate, family related, as a mother and a daughter, as a professional, as a world citizen who tries to understand odds of nationalism and hatred. Is there any wisdom gained from what one has observed and encountered? Lidija’s film confronts us with challenging questions. What is left of each of us once we got displaced? What happens to a family long after a war is over? Can one ensure that their children don’t have to carry their burden? In this very personal documentary, the director makes an inner journey through her memories, places and people she loves as she tries to leave her past behind her.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yFJAOAUNncwXZO8Z79eWr3BOsPk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Own Private War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lidija Zelovic","original_name":"Lidija Zelovic","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eFQs8HfQNTycfZF7vSxKom6gOZZ.jpg","credit_id":"5994c6c492514107c80023e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFJAOAUNncwXZO8Z79eWr3BOsPk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Eastern Neighbors Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
