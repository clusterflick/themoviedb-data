A proud Indian international student is attacked in a brightly lit train carriage against a backdrop of darkness. Unknown to his attackers his high caste status has little relevance, and in one poignant moment, he is rescued by his counterpart, an 'untouchable', a low caste. They are united by what would otherwise be impossible. The highly publicised event sends shock waves through the international community.","popularity":0.2689,"poster_path":"/z4L0dihxpJmEKdT3vwPQZjmGqAz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871342,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Girish Makwana","original_name":"Girish Makwana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599599f8c3a36856ef014395","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871342,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Girish Makwana","original_name":"Girish Makwana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599599f1c3a36856bd013ffc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5717184","wikidata_id":"Q55394429","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8EkxJXtA0ghJ7ljCe6C93FxKOsP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oCvYsjiIFl7PYmITF7gFHpNAtwj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":596},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z4L0dihxpJmEKdT3vwPQZjmGqAz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Colour of Darkness (English) | Official Trailer | Girish Makwana | Lorraine Grigg | Red Ribbon","key":"5g-ezea3zKg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2017-10-11T09:51:38.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c1395f792514132b409bddd"}]}}}
