Recorded at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California for an MTV special, the live sessions produced eleven tracks for the album, including a new acoustic version of “Hotel California”.","popularity":1.9742,"poster_path":"/aw4906OVExLaOcrfsxwJFEUEWwq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3086,"logo_path":"/iksa7hXQMvPIzfSq0Tuo4WPU8gc.png","name":"Image Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4485,"logo_path":"/nDWAVXc8LyfAj8Sb9yeH4ivoWxp.png","name":"Geffen Records","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Recorded in a film studio in Burbank, California in April 1994","title":"Eagles: Hell Freezes Over","video":true,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Eagles - Hell Freezes Over","type":"DVD"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Eagles - Hell Freezes Over","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Henley","original_name":"Don Henley","popularity":0.5938,"profile_path":"/mFVfzuSL1bEhnRwcdNG2vYY3q0D.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Drums, Acoustic Guitar, Percussion, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe463e9251416c75071f03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Walsh","original_name":"Joe Walsh","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/2cihrXQeODd0JiYd78IVu9whHW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Electric & Acoustic Guitar,  Slide-Guitar, Organ, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe463e9251416c75071f07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Frey","original_name":"Glenn Frey","popularity":0.178,"profile_path":"/f4Mi3Uws3ZLlb0cIGwkPX51R4ti.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Electric & Acoustic Guitar, Piano, Keyboards, Vocals","credit_id":"52fe463e9251416c75071eff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy B.
