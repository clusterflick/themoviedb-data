Fueled by curiosity and a dash of naiveté, two college buddies return to their ancestral home of Greene, Iowa to figure out how a modest kernel conquered America. With the help of some real farmers, oodles of fertilizer and government aide, and some genetically modified seeds, the friends manage to grow one acre of corn. Along the way, they unlock the hilarious absurdities and scary but hidden truths about America’s modern food system in this engrossing and eye-opening documentary.","popularity":0.4631,"poster_path":"/zVHWzV9o2FU1SasNxuiJMW2FY0V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-10-12","revenue":81368,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You Are What You Eat.","title":"King Corn","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":32,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe464a9251416c750739df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curtis Ellis","original_name":"Curtis Ellis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe464a9251416c750739e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl L.
