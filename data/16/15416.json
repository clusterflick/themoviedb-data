The good ones - the Ferraris, the Porches and the Aston Martins are driven to within an inch of their lives on the track. Some are even handed over to the Stig who makes a guest appearance. The bad ones are killed. Sawn in half. Hung, drawn and quartered. They're hammered and blown to pieces with dynamite and their skeletons left in the open to rot. I even find time for a game of car jousting. It's Heaven then, and Hell.","popularity":0.6428,"poster_path":"/n4Fw9YlfgrUr20kVaom1mNn0NcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18445,"logo_path":"/aLLOkuMcuuIff2oTIT1IuNzfAe7.png","name":"2Entertain","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":73186,"logo_path":null,"name":"On the Box Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"And so, this is the big one.","title":"Clarkson: Heaven and Hell","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Clarkson - Heaven and Hell","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c7507543b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russ Swift","original_name":"Russ Swift","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c75075467","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Collins","original_name":"Ben Collins","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/wD2YERFOIqmZlf5KRxyTR6GFAWa.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"The Stig","credit_id":"6067abaa0a94d40056fe367a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4123613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Jackson","original_name":"Charlotte Jackson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"6522def80cb33516f5c513e8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46579251416c75075447","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Klein","original_name":"Brian Klein","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46579251416c75075441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Klein","original_name":"Brian Klein","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46579251416c7507544d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85077,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Hembury","original_name":"Paul Hembury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46579251416c75075453","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85078,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Brown","original_name":"Ian Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ac8f87c3a3684091003bd0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Hodgson","original_name":"Brian Hodgson","popularity":0.0736,"profile_path":"/wVNhPZloslXnksOjzG6tAzx6jls.jpg","credit_id":"54ac8efcc3a36822b7004f39","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0940674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n4Fw9YlfgrUr20kVaom1mNn0NcW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":999,"name":"sports car"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
