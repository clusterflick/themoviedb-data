He is a renowned and celebrated conductor, sought after all over the world, and his talent is a source of national pride. He is rich, intelligent, and cultured. He has a dream wife with a promising future in aerospace. He has just moved into a magnificent apartment. In short, he is thriving, and everything is going perfectly for him. But a simple traffic light triggers his downfall! He spirals into depression, consults the top specialists, raises countless questions, experiences periods of recovery and bursts of excitement, only to plunge back into a bottomless pit, pushing away everyone trying to bring him back to reason. When \"Tom the genius\" collapses under the weight of his illness, it marks the beginning of a nightmare for all his friends.
