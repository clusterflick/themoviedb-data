The makers claimed that 'Old Media' documentary crews couldn't understand the internet culture that filesharers took part in, and that they saw peer-to-peer organization as a threat to their livelihoods. Because of that, they were determined to accurately represent the filesharing community from within. Notably, Steal This Film was released and distributed, free of charge, through the same filesharing networks that the film documents.","popularity":0.2435,"poster_path":"/4Q7EahFIXrbB3buo4zeMNKNHCIt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steal This Film","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":30,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rickard Falkvinge","original_name":"Rickard Falkvinge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe464d9251416c7507412f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gottfrid Svartholm","original_name":"Gottfrid Svartholm","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/m6pVQSGrFM3IdQE2x7vbD4sHzTl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe464d9251416c75074133","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fredrik Neij","original_name":"Fredrik Neij","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/nIHA0GfEOaLrzYKJ0rash7z6PPc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe464d9251416c75074137","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sunde","original_name":"Peter Sunde","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/lXRXctfyTtd6BcuBNEfy7Tu6XCf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe464d9251416c7507413b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Swartz","original_name":"Aaron Swartz","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/p1un4XSPLPCp4LaQoVOY6upr0Yq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55b0e876c3a3687265008368","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sunde","original_name":"Peter Sunde","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/lXRXctfyTtd6BcuBNEfy7Tu6XCf.jpg","credit_id":"57b9e360c3a36845d3000a0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie King","original_name":"Jamie King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6762b30d67c96321804a279d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1422757","wikidata_id":"Q1852055","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nGWrIVGbY2mW4CNzxiSgh576gkq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x3DvtlP9XJCH1geMQHqvyJml13x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.29,"height":483,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kecBRe1i5EEolXh1H9iPIfnrVXk.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2072}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":951,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Q7EahFIXrbB3buo4zeMNKNHCIt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":634}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"},{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
