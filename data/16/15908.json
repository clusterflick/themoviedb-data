Since the tragic accidental death of his beloved wife, the soul of the gourmet restaurant \"La Vie\", business has been bad. Daughter Franzi, handicapped by a stiff knee joint since the accident, doesn't let anyone get near her. The little son Michael also feels neglected, because Frank mainly concentrates on cooking. When preparing his famous lobster or seasoning one of his irresistible sauces, the gourmet chef is in his element. But Frank has lost sight of reality: Since the friendly reception from Frank's wife has been missing, far too few guests appreciate his exquisite cuisine, and so \"La Vie\" is on the verge of bankruptcy.","popularity":0.5259,"poster_path":"/h59OmSPNqW1eygdQZGJKVoktDJQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verführung in 6 Gängen","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Cuisine et séduction","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Verführung in sechs Gängen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heio von Stetten","original_name":"Heio von Stetten","popularity":0.2374,"profile_path":"/7NzeRqqRGnWmdFX7DoPofPAU8Cc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank Dranneman","credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rüdiger Vogler","original_name":"Rüdiger Vogler","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/bW9FkPAZ1HnzxmlLsXNIgOyTQ0O.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Georg Krimmler","credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Ruland","original_name":"Tina Ruland","popularity":0.2649,"profile_path":"/r0jwJf980PHeMl4TqvN3uGaXRZv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marlene Renner","credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frau Hirschfuß","credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Kretschmar","original_name":"Ralph Kretschmar","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/mp0hw8YDDSLav7JJghWVMliS1dW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"5607169dc3a368121b0026c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Deiß","original_name":"Victor Deiß","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/pT9zyuhy7QEkuQ5aQFG1PPfE2kt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Marlenes Vater","credit_id":"560716a9c3a36812150026dc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Andres","original_name":"Pascal Andres","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/cMmdgo37oyeDJnPucgthDJ81LuO.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"62cd569295665822ce7c4c9b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33974,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Axel Henschel","original_name":"Axel Henschel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6dd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42399,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melanie Werwie","original_name":"Melanie Werwie","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78915,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saskia Lechtenbrink","original_name":"Saskia Lechtenbrink","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6d1","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Pose","original_name":"Wolfgang Pose","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6d7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariane Zeller","original_name":"Ariane Zeller","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32965,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanja Ziegler","original_name":"Tanja Ziegler","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46899251416c7507b6e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0376301","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h59OmSPNqW1eygdQZGJKVoktDJQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
