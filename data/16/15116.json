A large part of the action takes place around the snowboard wunderkind Shaun White, as he prepares to compete in the 2006 winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy. The other various narrative strands follow the different paths of the individual boarders as we see them in action and they talk about why it is they do what they do. The film also introduces Burton Snow Board founder and CEO of Burton, Jake Burton Carpenter.","popularity":0.2054,"poster_path":"/xK46qE5AXhdR8ENKl5YBYOV2iR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4931,"logo_path":"/hmJLws39uLGtI8uX9yitDMMD0oq.png","name":"Burton Snowboards","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Right Or Wrong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Burton","original_name":"Jake Burton","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/quzgAdfbjGCscVOF8IDvpYYkExE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe463b9251416c75071943","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Burton Carpenter","original_name":"George Burton Carpenter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe463b9251416c75071947","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun White","original_name":"Shaun White","popularity":0.2483,"profile_path":"/mTQtLpRHgMD6tE6ir77XRXq6Gyw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe463b9251416c7507194b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terje Haakonsen","original_name":"Terje Haakonsen","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/6A2Oo2oCcVmVwGV8MS3oFgJoH04.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe463b9251416c7507194f","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0841021","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xK46qE5AXhdR8ENKl5YBYOV2iR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
