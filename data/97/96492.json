The Europeans who work for the Belgian mining company and the Blacks who live in the town are taken as hostages by the invaders, who start a blood bath, shooting Europeans as well as Africans. Many of the Europeans being French, the French decide to organize a counter-attack, and to send a Regiment of Paratroopers from the Foreign Legion. The movie follows the stories of Delbart, a former non-commissioned officer, who was about to go back to France with his African wife and his child, Damrémont, who was Delbart's replacement, Bia, a Zairian doctor, and Annie, an American married to a Belgian engineer as well as Non com Legion officer Federico and the French Ambassador and the Military Attaché.","popularity":0.8314,"poster_path":"/75BY7cj2TQDYRSLms3OS2ZuK9zp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16670,"logo_path":null,"name":"SNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bela
