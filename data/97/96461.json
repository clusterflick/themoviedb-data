When Native Canadian Silas Crow is forced to write a personal essay in order to get a much-desired job, he tells the story of the rape and murder of an Indian girl by a drunken thug. When the killer received a lenient two-year sentence for manslaughter, the First Nations community felt shock and anger—and tried desperately to deal with the after-effects of this lack of justice.","popularity":1.9206,"poster_path":"/exqsixP7i48pMsV2ejfBaSyWhno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineplex-Odeon
