He calls on her, and although she will not talk to him about her life, his visit sends her to her chest of Bolívar's letters. As she reads them, the sepia-toned present gives way to flashbacks in color: she meets 'the Liberator' in 1822, becomes his lover, and also becomes a colonel in his military movement to realize the 'Gran Colombia', one nation across South America. As plague (brought by the ship) closes in on Manuela's household, so does her tempestuous story move toward Bolívar's betrayal and death.","popularity":0.2427,"poster_path":"/6hrA1PXzF9QgNlIdipo1qAndUyr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Guakamaya","origin_country":"VE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2000-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuela Sáenz","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1009347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Valdés","original_name":"Beatriz Valdés","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/fzhxn5IRErfRGx1xlCeFIaZUXox.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Manuela","credit_id":"52fe49b39251416c750d076d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariano Álvarez","original_name":"Mariano Álvarez","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Simón Bolívar","credit_id":"55512f02c3a368436d0013c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Wildpret","original_name":"Erich Wildpret","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/GIGdxiDUoKyNvXvYGYbjg0p0x1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herman Melville","credit_id":"55512f4dc3a3683032002c1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orlando Urdaneta","original_name":"Orlando Urdaneta","popularity":0.1775,"profile_path":"/zre1ADIgACzmXRAdVGM7gGakNWj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67bfafb2c029139b0e358d75","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejo Felipe","original_name":"Alejo Felipe","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/fSn4KGJ4B4xi7nAYGVKt60LeXz7.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67bfafd010e79c3424a23aba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asdrúbal Meléndez","original_name":"Asdrúbal Meléndez","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/pU0w4LPlc3dhSjohPJYF8mDsvdS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67d2b5af64443984b11e39a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Carlos Alarcón","original_name":"Juan Carlos Alarcón","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"667c927fa457d98a3fadb83b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Salazar","original_name":"Manuel Salazar","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"667c92959d65bea400aa765b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Manuel Montesinos","original_name":"Juan Manuel Montesinos","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67bfafc1c5de842b4ba238d1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leonardo Padrón","original_name":"Leonardo Padrón","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/4uX82OYBoqCqoOQGS7X25Zj6B1I.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49b39251416c750d0769","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Rísquez","original_name":"Diego Rísquez","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/RMg2OcmRGHlapaOLGfUjqkT2Vp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49b39251416c750d0773","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0295423","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1066,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hrA1PXzF9QgNlIdipo1qAndUyr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
