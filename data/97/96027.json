Through the documentary, we witness the absurdity of war, the responsibilities of governments and armies and the atrociousness of blinded fanatics.","popularity":0.3146,"poster_path":"/jUyljU5jf1RRRRKUlhC4Tss08Vv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8940,"logo_path":"/rUoTXqWRNJ58b0UMbwMcPy0I8bi.png","name":"CL Productions","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2011-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“In every war, truth is always the first victim” Aeschylus (525-456 B.C.)","title":"Shooting VS Shooting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dying for the truth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Megrelis","original_name":"Νίκος Μεγγρέλης","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/yqDhYHcaTWDMdSHQilhPCQA1a87.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Director / Narrator","credit_id":"66fd3fbf7e90373237595d93","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Megrelis","original_name":"Νίκος Μεγγρέλης","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/yqDhYHcaTWDMdSHQilhPCQA1a87.jpg","credit_id":"52fe499d9251416c750cdd75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kostas Lambropoulos","original_name":"Κώστας Λαμπρόπουλος","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499d9251416c750cdd7b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicola Piovani","original_name":"Nicola Piovani","popularity":0.1775,"profile_path":"/56tRfEIn4RBPhjJ7JOGCOtTZApU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe499d9251416c750cdd87","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1007610,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christoforos Lazaris","original_name":"Χριστόφορος Λάζαρης","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499d9251416c750cdd81","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1007614,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nikos Politis","original_name":"Νίκος Πολίτης","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499d9251416c750cdd99","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christos V.
