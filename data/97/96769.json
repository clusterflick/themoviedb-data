She gets to know her latex and wooden travelling partners along the way, and with them deconstructs herself and her lost love in this ventriloquial docu-mockumentary requiem. Ken Campbell was a hugely respected maverick of the British theatre, an eccentric genius who would snort out forgotten artforms. Nina was his protégé in ventriloquism and has been said to have reinvented the artform. This film is truly unique in genre and style. No one has seen ventriloquism like this before.","popularity":1.2979,"poster_path":"/yb6FOH4nsB6A4VpuvUM975Mz52e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":21620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nina Conti Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The legacy of six bereaved puppets","title":"Nina Conti: Her Master's Voice","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"A Ventriloquist's Story: Her Master's Voice","type":"TV title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Conti","original_name":"Nina Conti","popularity":0.3444,"profile_path":"/eytK1qN2GW74k00DlRmiI7fclhN.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d254b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Broadbent","original_name":"Jim Broadbent","popularity":1.9528,"profile_path":"/s7lXYfrsJoGA4vKmyv61SPgABmR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d254f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Cummings","original_name":"Brad Cummings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d255b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nacho Estrada","original_name":"Nacho Estrada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d255f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Horn","original_name":"Dan Horn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d2563","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hoskins","original_name":"Bob Hoskins","popularity":1.1612,"profile_path":"/qOeE7bVHAsNTbP77Qk6TwrrWHZc.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d2567","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Johnson","original_name":"Jay Johnson","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/dTi4KR3Y8XgZGa45QZqOpjCMAS0.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d256b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":204965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Johnson","original_name":"Kevin Johnson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49c19251416c750d256f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Campbell","original_name":"Ken Campbell","popularity":0.2515,"profile_path":"/vnDf7qSyuZ5EsVPKNNeocvnA0Qo.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"551da4079251413741000c48","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2258022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Campbell","original_name":"Daisy Campbell","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":"/iExD2dUm34ZZvw38il4Ze29MlNS.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c7e6d8c925141276c16c4a6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2258022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Campbell","original_name":"Daisy Campbell","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":"/iExD2dUm34ZZvw38il4Ze29MlNS.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Self -
