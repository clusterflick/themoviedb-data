A ferry boat docks, disgorging its huddled mass. People move briskly along Wall St. or stroll more languorously through a cemetery. Ranks of skyscrapers extrude columns of smoke and steam. In plain view. Or framed, as through a balustrade. A crane promotes the city's upward progress, as an ironworker balances on a high beam. A locomotive in a railway yard prepares to depart, while an arriving ocean liner jostles with attentive tugboats. Fading sunlight is reflected in the waters of the harbor. The imagery is interspersed with quotations from Walt Whitman, who is left unnamed.","popularity":0.5438,"poster_path":"/scVpkeRVTp1xcwG5mHZeB4Euain.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manhatta","video":false,"vote_average":6.609,"vote_count":69,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mannahatta","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"New York the Magnificent","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Strand","original_name":"Paul Strand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/10rw1BdClbxzfwGEMJaj8GJEZyW.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49c79251416c750d2fa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Sheeler","original_name":"Charles Sheeler","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49c79251416c750d2fab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578446,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sarah McGrail","original_name":"Sarah McGrail","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c3303c9251414b0a001bb4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Strand","original_name":"Paul Strand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/10rw1BdClbxzfwGEMJaj8GJEZyW.jpg","credit_id":"5bb8f334c3a36824280115a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Sheeler","original_name":"Charles Sheeler","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb8f34cc3a368241f01554e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2583611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walt Whitman","original_name":"Walt Whitman","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/qBZxzIEMkEQri8acpZ48nI7osCD.jpg","credit_id":"5e81dc8a2a210c00132c298b","department":"Crew","job":"Poem"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0131468","wikidata_id":"Q2098642","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Ds2InC8XuwswApyl6t146JeEp9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTlDgxur93gKdXQHpYR1ifFSLuv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/scVpkeRVTp1xcwG5mHZeB4Euain.jpg","vote_average":8.034,"vote_count":5,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mZN5lsNurWIoTcG07aXq2X925c4.jpg","vote_average":1.066,"vote_count":5,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":558,"name":"city portrait"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":168346,"name":"manhattan, new york city"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":269412,"name":"poetic documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
