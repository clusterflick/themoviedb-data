The tale of how Molly had actually been born a boy called Bradford Dillman but, because of Mum's want for a little girl, she asked the doctors to chop her willy off. The offending item has been kept for Molly in a shoebox on top of her wardrobe which now looms over everything she does. Molly's over active imagination manifests itself into the arrival of Bradford Dillman.
