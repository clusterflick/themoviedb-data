The sides of the box fall to the ground, but instead of containing the magician a lively clown steps forth who further mystifies the audience by causing the box to disappear, and in its place is seen a fully laid table with a smoking dinner, to which the clown applies himself. The table, however, suddenly disappears much to the astonishment of the clown, who is confronted by the magician in the garb of Mephistopheles. This he suddenly changes to that of a sculptor, and in the background is seen a pedestal with the bust of a young lady, which comes to life as the sculptor applies the mallet and chisel.","popularity":0.3075,"poster_path":"/bGhMSIKGkinEPJnEEQMxt8BhbPS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1898-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magician","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":51,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A bűvész","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Black Magic","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Le Sculpteur","credit_id":"609f3396a2750200789b4fdc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49a69251416c750cec55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0214902","wikidata_id":"Q742305","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bBXZ3ZqkXnIRjtlWMxgtTAE2pEa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bGhMSIKGkinEPJnEEQMxt8BhbPS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ZMxtk3XFeNQtOMP9XpLc414RZN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":855}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2343,"name":"magic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1898-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
