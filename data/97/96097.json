The man who loves her is in shock over her departure from his life. When Philippa arrives at Brede, a cloistered Benedictine monastery, the abbess who was responsible for convincing her to enter this vocation suddenly dies. Her successor is Catherine, a sensitive leader who's the first to tell the newcomer to the community that all nuns are to love without a preference for one over another. This becomes very difficult when Joanna, a young nun, singles Sister Philippa out and grows very attached to her.","popularity":1.2705,"poster_path":"/p0IhHu92K9i5Jl1KdMjjcktctfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4898,"logo_path":"/nm8d7P7MJNiBLdgIzUK0gkuEA4r.png","name":"CBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1925,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tomorrow
