Malins during the First World War, is brilliantly decoded in this riveting experimental doc that unravels fascinating secrets and manipulations. A compelling contemplation of the ownership of history plays out on intertitles taken from excerpts of Malins’s controversial autobiography juxtaposed with conflicting historical accounts and emotionally devastating clips from the original film. Dispatched to the front as Britain’s “Official Kinematographer,” Malins filmed from the muddy trenches to capture the valour and horror of “the big push” on July 1, 1916—a day that has become synonymous with the futility of war. The British alone suffered 58,000 casualties by nightfall. The rising tension in this fascinating deconstruction of propaganda, illusion, and “truth” in documentary is underscored by a haunting electro-ambient soundscape.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How I Filmed The War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1010069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuval Sagiv","original_name":"Yuval Sagiv","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49bc9251416c750d1abf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2007397","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2010 Trailers: HOW I FILMED THE WAR","key":"Oz74mddIV0g","published_at":"2010-04-01T05:14:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d9c3a3685448008068"}]}}}
