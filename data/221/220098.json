On the 4th of July, while the drunken Sheriff Paisley is busy with the local parade and festivities, Burt quietly steals a million dollars in cash from the cellar safe in the local rich old widow's house. Unsuspected, Burt makes plans to live the rest of his life in the lap of luxury in a far off place with his attractive girlfriend, local hash house waitress Jeanette. But when a crisis of conscience hits him like a wave of ice cold water, he starts to think twice about his dastardly deed, and how that purloining of the old lady's money is wrongly affecting his friends as well as innocent locals. But will Burt do the right thing?","popularity":1.312,"poster_path":"/bhIoQ7QP3o0ZWOQL4DOH84XpZov.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shapiro Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":158310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westfront Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You gotta be cool when the money's this hot.","title":"Hot Money","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Zen Business","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Murphy","original_name":"Michael Murphy","popularity":0.444,"profile_path":"/3quWjoqh8vKoSXE9Ll3AC7pgsRh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Burt / Tom","credit_id":"52fe4d999251416c7513a8f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sheriff Paisley","credit_id":"52fe4d999251416c7513a8fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Lange","original_name":"Ann Lange","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jeanette","credit_id":"61052973ee43e8005e37be82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Buccos","original_name":"Daniel Buccos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Federal Agent","credit_id":"61052a362a210c007e1643f2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu M.
