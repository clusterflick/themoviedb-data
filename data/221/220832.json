Mathematical notations of precise time-code editing were applied to construct illustrations of temporal symmetry, duality and transposition — time-based equivalents of musical compositional principles such as counterpoint and serialism. Astonishing temporal interventions — a 180-degree pan gazing downward on a New York City street that progresses from day to night, an image of Mount Rainier in which the foreground and background unfold in different time planes — unfold as symbolic transformations of natural and urban landscapes.","popularity":0.108,"poster_path":"/adE1aGblmK5h0CU0jv2d3Ern1gk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ancient of Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Viola","original_name":"Bill Viola","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/qvXzhdfBNfL7RVaqtmw9STYvUAu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db99251416c7513e781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1798599","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/adE1aGblmK5h0CU0jv2d3Ern1gk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":764},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d8sUOG5p2E51aQYTGt7MPu7pnwu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
