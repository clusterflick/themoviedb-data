Fronting a crack band featuring Blondie drummer Clem Burke and future David Bowie guitarist Carlos Alomar, Pop is as unpredictable and dominant as ever (no small feat since he is sporting a mini skirt, garters and stockings for most of the show). Filmed on November 25 1981 near the end of their tour supporting his 1981 album Party, Iggy and co. are raw and ready for business. Iggy Pop Live 1981 provides a snapshot of a hungry artist at the top of his game in front of an adoring crowd.","popularity":0.3027,"poster_path":"/4AVmwNjIwTJCHLZmhsNxTqQzVoB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iggy Pop: Live San Fran 1981","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iggy Pop","original_name":"Iggy Pop","popularity":1.0052,"profile_path":"/kZwFoGujhS3D39R1uyuyNbgSPr0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d9d9251416c7513afe9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Alomar","original_name":"Carlos Alomar","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d9d9251416c7513afed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clem Burke","original_name":"Clem Burke","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/ihIQ9bj1vQRMzGVamgRh8Y1EIG6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d9d9251416c7513aff1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Rees","original_name":"Joe Rees","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6433c34f391b9c00774797cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sBcE4dMVFZUUUwfiagOa7U3Ux7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4AVmwNjIwTJCHLZmhsNxTqQzVoB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
