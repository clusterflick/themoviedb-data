After a very successful run in London’s West End in 1968, viewings of this controversial movie have been few and far between.  Stunning black and white camera work by Ian Wilson brings to life this “chilling fable” by Max Steuer, a lecturer (now Reader Emeritus) at the London School of Economics. Avoiding easy answers, The Committee uses a surreal murder to explore the tension and conflict between bureaucracy on one side, and individual freedom on the other. Many films, such as Total Recall, Fahrenheit 451 and Camus’ The Stranger, see the state as ignorant and repressive, and pass over the inevitable weaknesses lying deep in individuals. Drawing on the ideas of R.D. Laing, a psychologically hip state faces an all too human protagonist.","popularity":0.6365,"poster_path":"/kUhoyYIsByrYLsdvccftoycU0IQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Craytic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The mystery film of the 1960's","title":"The Committee","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Brown","original_name":"Arthur Brown","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/pbDHIrCeYwcYyZc8IM8wCIMN5fr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"534661f6c3a3682f19000f3e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Gardner","original_name":"Jimmy Gardner","popularity":0.1202,"profile_path":"/v6QxfIDuoCTJlD5Rk6eLw6pnHQc.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Boss","credit_id":"59dd7fef925141251f08422e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Jones","original_name":"Paul Jones","popularity":0.16,"profile_path":"/WpFH0zZbpfYFWntJ7TyzPeWo5l.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Central figure","credit_id":"5346622fc3a3682f0b000f62","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Kempinski","original_name":"Tom Kempinski","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/bOAIsl37mhqyXehjua83w3q5qzI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Victim","credit_id":"53466238c3a3682f20000eee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Langdon Lloyd","original_name":"Robert Langdon Lloyd","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/jK6BCHtEurkn5dCDeLMKKv6DWar.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Committee Director","credit_id":"53466242c3a3682f20000ef3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Munro","original_name":"Pauline Munro","popularity":0.2744,"profile_path":"/irhfKEzLpqJsU8ruV7SI7PUWnhR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"5346624cc3a3682f26000f6f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Brown","original_name":"Arthur Brown","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/pbDHIrCeYwcYyZc8IM8wCIMN5fr.jpg","credit_id":"61071ef4f10a1a00752365e2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Steuer","original_name":"Max Steuer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53466394c3a3682f20000f0e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308584,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Steuer","original_name":"Max Steuer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53466266c3a3682f0b000f67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sykes","original_name":"Peter Sykes","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5346625ec3a3682f26000f71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185959,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Elliott","original_name":"Peter Elliott","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53466360c3a3682f19000f55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sykes","original_name":"Peter Sykes","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5346626ec3a3682f04000f16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ian Wilson","original_name":"Ian Wilson","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db2e4d84b0c630014ea9997","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0062820","wikidata_id":"Q2562732","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ctBzu5DHpOOvpcsK8rS4Okkdwy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1133,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kUhoyYIsByrYLsdvccftoycU0IQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1133,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/j3Oko1k0EptL4KlDO5YtYStCqPb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4480,"name":"businessman"},{"id":5340,"name":"investigation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
