She is taken to a boarding school where she is forced to adopt Western Euro-centric ways and learn English, often under brutal treatment. Only one sympathetic white teacher who is more and more repelled by this bigotry offers her any help from among the staff. That, with her force of will, Ashtecome (forced to take the name Amelia) is determined to hold on to her identity and that of her siblings, who were also abducted.","popularity":1.868,"poster_path":"/jfWLHsA3Camw64SzqDIMsunwQAE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantis Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":16744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazing Spirit Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A moving tribute to a young girl's courage and indomitable spirit...","title":"Where the Spirit Lives","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Henkien tanssi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wo ich zuhause bin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":163070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle St. John","original_name":"Michelle St. John","popularity":0.2193,"profile_path":"/sscpMgCvvC6IIa6iELjJGMmy7X4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Komi / Amelia","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513be8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Bruisedhead Fox","original_name":"Kim Bruisedhead Fox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anataki","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513be93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":163132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Jones","original_name":"Marianne Jones","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Komi's Mother","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513be97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Chief Moon","original_name":"Gus Chief Moon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ka - moos - ee","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513be9b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clayton Julian","original_name":"Clayton Julian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pita / Abraham","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513be9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Cozry","original_name":"Margaret Cozry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513bea3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marge Fox","original_name":"Marge Fox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Anataki's Mother","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513bea7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann-Marie MacDonald","original_name":"Ann-Marie MacDonald","popularity":0.1519,"profile_path":"/wQn2Tv7CdYEq7YjOV6vHj4infO8.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Kathleen","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513beab","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":181497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Mulcahy","original_name":"Sean Mulcahy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513beaf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Malkin","original_name":"Sam Malkin","popularity":0.1859,"profile_path":"/uWu7qpq6cXXhuzSKhCHzkLIpfUV.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Crawford","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513beb3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":563095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Petrie","original_name":"Doris Petrie","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/wme62CJ43ZYF1jKhTj13oK4oHdB.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Miss Weir","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513beb7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chapelle Jaffe","original_name":"Chapelle Jaffe","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/zG5NSiL9l8BcuFrz7sCOF0FMDHx.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Miss Appleby","credit_id":"52fe4da49251416c7513bebb","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":201730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Louise Bomberry","original_name":"Tina Louise Bomberry","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Asst.
