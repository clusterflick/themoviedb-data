They prefer the sounds of the birds to the roar of highway traffic, and scorn the money-chasing of city life. Covering a period of four seasons in the remote backwoods of Maine, Dead River Rough Cut presents a revealing look at an individual way of life. Wagg  and Lane earn a living and accept their isolation for the independence it allows them. But not everyone would want to draw water from a hole in the ice. They share their reflections about women, politics, taxes, the lone life and death.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-20","revenue":24,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead River Rough Cut","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dead River Rough Cut - Home Dentistry -","key":"sr6B_msM1FE","published_at":"2008-12-18T22:21:12.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec71bc3a368544800b257"}]}}}
