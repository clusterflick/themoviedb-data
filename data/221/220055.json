(N.B. proper prints and a negative do exist, just not in Lampert's possession!) With dubious methods used to achieve authenticity, El Adios Largos is at once an uncanny aesthetic experience and a playful exploration of the philosophical conundrums involved for those working to preserve film history for generations to come.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Adios Largos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Lampert","original_name":"Andrew Lampert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/82CSy39rkc6U3dclAdvrrMBeFIe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d979251416c7513a5ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3118724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
