He gets a job with an insurance company, and assures the company president he will get the goods on the gang or die in the attempt. At the company offices, he meets Carol Carter and she, believing he is a shyster (possibly redundant) lawyer in the employ of the racketeers gives him as little help as possible. Dan visits his brother Eddie, who is mixed up with the gang and tries to make him break away. Eddie is belligerent but finally, because of the pressure brought by Dan and his wife Tonia, agrees to go straight. The gang, led by \"Duke\" Trotti, fears he will squeal and they kill him, plus they make his death look like an accident and plan to collect on it. Dan is closing in on the gang when Carol, who is now his assistant, comes up with some conclusive evidence, but \"Duke\" has plans to get rid of her before she can give the information to Dan.","popularity":0.6764,"poster_path":"/gYAuONAr5p5nTFoT6OtUWKeIYvX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invincible Pictures Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easy Money","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Onslow Stevens","original_name":"Onslow Stevens","popularity":0.3669,"profile_path":"/gbDKyMLZx2Wrjv9uwAAJZjFw0Pv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dan Adams","credit_id":"52fe4dad9251416c7513d01f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Linaker","original_name":"Kay Linaker","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/iDi0YyfjOPVRiwr4GS2z5UOcdTO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carol Carter","credit_id":"52fe4dad9251416c7513d023","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Madison","original_name":"Noel Madison","popularity":0.1314,"profile_path":"/xegNlV2ey900Pgr4aXJ0zVbXKpj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"'Duke' Trotti","credit_id":"52fe4dad9251416c7513d027","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Vincent","original_name":"Allen Vincent","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/lNlNtpQJVAmLYzgQhnaeZNdC0H3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Edward Adams, alias Edward Clayton","credit_id":"52fe4dad9251416c7513d02b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1143281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Barondess","original_name":"Barbara Barondess","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/8NWNQjRRdWeknIrl2Off0F0DWxS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tonia","credit_id":"52fe4dad9251416c7513d02f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Homans","original_name":"Robert Homans","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/4milvzRXMyVrDsVNdZ70pQwyPx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Det.
