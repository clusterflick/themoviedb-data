Adhering to a solitary intimacy while simultaneously acting as an ode to human endeavour and shared impulses toward fulfillment through art, Listening to the Space in my Room is a moving testament to existence (whose traces are found in literature, music, filmmaking, gardening) and our endless search for meaning and authenticity. The film's precise yet enigmatic sound-image construction carries a rare emotional weight.","popularity":0.4194,"poster_path":"/8iHnwjBp2towaKR80aj7BnXz5CO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listening to the Space in My Room","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a5e1ce1c3a3686a4e00bb81","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4da29251416c7513b99b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5a5e1c68c3a3686a4e00bb34","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5a5e1c6dc3a3686a8800b9a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3120868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":894,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n46lfIxqPVDfN9ltWJ6BXmgAZOE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1589},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rlh3jWmyBDJbVPGSFqdc6NKqt8V.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":4,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/IUnaZL5odQrQLXQDc6ei1tawXw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2046}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iHnwjBp2towaKR80aj7BnXz5CO.jpg","vote_average":2.066,"vote_count":5,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sSG2lyphNknpQs0ZgtfZ7Sw6uho.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":4,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2105,"name":"garden"},{"id":3457,"name":"cellist"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
