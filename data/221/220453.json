Set in the early 1980s, The Cherokee Word for Water begins in the homes of a small town in rural Oklahoma where many houses lack running water and others are little more than shacks. The movie is told from the perspective of Wilma Mankiller and full-blood Cherokee organizer Charlie Soap who join forces to battle opposition and build a 16-mile waterline system using a community of volunteers. In the process, they inspire the townspeople to trust each other, to trust their way of thinking, and to spark a reawakening of the universal indigenous values of reciprocity and interconnectedness. This project also inspired a self-help movement in Indian Country that continues to this day.  The movie is dedicated to Wilma Mankillerâ€™s vision, compassion and incredible grace.","popularity":1.332,"poster_path":"/4C2CmPAoBl3kmxWT34JfrjeMCiL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of Wilma Mankiller, the first modern female Chief of the Cherokee Nation.","title":"The Cherokee Word for Water","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Guerrero","original_name":"Kimberly Guerrero","popularity":0.3136,"profile_path":"/faH5QqtRVkI25U6VJ7MNR66jiNe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wilma Mankiller","credit_id":"52fe4da89251416c7513c675","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mo J.","original_name":"Mo J.","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Charlie Soap","credit_id":"52fe4da89251416c7513c679","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steeve Reeves","original_name":"Steeve Reeves","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Johnson Soap","credit_id":"52fe4da89251416c7513c67d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darryl Tonemah","original_name":"Darryl Tonemah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Chief Ross Swimmer","credit_id":"52fe4da89251416c7513c681","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oren R.
