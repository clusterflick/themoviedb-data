INSIDE starts with a shot of a burnt tree stump in a forest. Materials are gathered. What are the various branches, stones and pieces of grass for and what will the silent activities lead to? INSIDE slowly uncovers an act of human solidarity. The camera hovers around two boys, ramping up the tension, and is supported by an excellent soundtrack.","popularity":0.0608,"poster_path":"/2Y9moTuaqPObAVrSH6hPENMyPyT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2013-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Álvarez Rebeil","original_name":"Fernando Álvarez Rebeil","popularity":0.2226,"profile_path":"/zhICVhOwphg1owi9ujKOPhjrfWA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a717","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Huerta Zamacona","original_name":"Fernando Huerta Zamacona","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a71b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","original_name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/7eOt3Py78URTlExrXSGmL0iiF2D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","original_name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/7eOt3Py78URTlExrXSGmL0iiF2D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a707","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","original_name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/7eOt3Py78URTlExrXSGmL0iiF2D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a713","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","original_name":"Emiliano Rocha Minter","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/7eOt3Py78URTlExrXSGmL0iiF2D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a721","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205021,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cristian Manzutto","original_name":"Cristian Manzutto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d989251416c7513a733","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205019,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Emiliano García","original_name":"Emiliano García","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570a21b2c3a3681d3a006e60","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205020,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Fermín Díaz","original_name":"Fermín Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570a21bcc3a3680b77003809","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205022,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nico Raibak","original_name":"Nico Raibak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570a21d1c3a36873a6003211","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yollótl Alvarado","original_name":"Yollótl Alvarado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbd083d925141378b01d881","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2665228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Y9moTuaqPObAVrSH6hPENMyPyT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.575,"height":915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jHtO6pDwRARe6hSghZ1aJugTwcs.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":526},{"aspect_ratio":0.596,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXLvd2Tcy42ZcoBfJ4J6nMgmckO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":3,"width":595}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER-DENTRO","key":"56726051","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-01-03T23:52:00.000Z","id":"5d675a5ea9b9a4000ff47344"}]}}}
