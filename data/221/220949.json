The clatter of the carriages quickly disappears, along with the wail of the locomotive. The people at the station are all asleep. But why are they so exhausted ? And what are they waiting for?  Set inside an isolated train depot, The Train Station is one of Sergei Loznitsa's most haunting films. It is also one of his most pointed social critiques. In this film, we are brought to a remote train station deep in the Russian woods. It's nighttime. In the distance, we hear the clatter of locomotives. The station, a small wooden building, sits silently, surrounded only by snow and train tracks.","popularity":0.0904,"poster_path":"/e19TiJTjoIab1y4fuQmHJ7gF5kW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70149,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Okno","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2000-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Halt","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Train Stop","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Haltepunkt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La station","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"O stathmos tou trenou","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Przystanek","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Полустанок","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Train Station","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Halt","type":"aka"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Polustanok","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"The Train Stop","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4dbc9251416c7513edd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238619,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Kostomarov","original_name":"Pavel Kostomarov","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/pqatuWDMaRtRkkBtC8jInaMw70Y.jpg","credit_id":"56729cc992514163cb0023c2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1765619,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Zakarjewskiy","original_name":"Alexander Zakarjewskiy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b2854892514177b0000350","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"5ebd46151283e9001ecc2375","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0266861","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n5ZWNuGoOClOOJWxeJCBpyS9OkA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sxx84lvzD8mYJMUHuYzkvLushng.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e19TiJTjoIab1y4fuQmHJ7gF5kW.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fSknuLo2xr8Wx3Qi652QXXnelI1.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Leipzig DOK Festival","release_date":"2000-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
