Michael, a successful photographer in London, no longer feels at home in the parochial environment of his upbringing. With little interest in football and almost no emotional connection with his father, Michael struggles through the game as a bored spectator whilst his father is both irritable and irritating. As time passes, though, Michael soon realizes that his father's bad-tempered quirks could be the signs of something graver. Full Time examines the fragile connections that bind love, memory and the gaps in between","popularity":0.3747,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Full tid","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Langham","original_name":"Chris Langham","popularity":0.4053,"profile_path":"/nBMD5a0XVnk8DQbj7yTjRXX5NHc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vinnie","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kieran Hill","original_name":"Kieran Hill","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huw Higginson","original_name":"Huw Higginson","popularity":0.2001,"profile_path":"/8rcClDBYrVvnvyhGeyYKRxJ8wth.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenyon Garrish","original_name":"Kenyon Garrish","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Paul's Son","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":192933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Leicester","original_name":"Margot Leicester","popularity":0.1993,"profile_path":"/M2PEeYUdkrd4VjI1D0lsHbiG8t.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vinnie's Wife","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Begluk","original_name":"Corinne Begluk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Michael's Wife","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3dd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Gill","original_name":"Mark Gill","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/wQwnvdkCZMXSx4Retj5LJ1RBu2j.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Gill","original_name":"Mark Gill","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/wQwnvdkCZMXSx4Retj5LJ1RBu2j.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3e9","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205882,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Thacker","original_name":"William Thacker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3ef","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182440,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Baldwin Li","original_name":"Baldwin Li","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4db89251416c7513e3f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2666096","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
