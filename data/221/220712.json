Within 50 years, that population was cut in half as Western diseases claimed thousands of lives. A litany of events followed: American missionaries preached unfamiliar ideas and customs; sugarcane and pineapple plantations absorbed individual farmlands; waves of immigrant workers arrived, making Hawaiians a minority in their own land; and WWII brought a lasting military presence. University of Hawai'i sociologists estimate that the extinction of full-blooded Hawaiians could come within the next 45 years.  This compelling story of a race displaced and now on the verge of extinction is brilliantly told in this award-winning documentary created by the great-granddaughter of Hawaiian high chiefs and English seafarers.","popularity":0.1882,"poster_path":"/hsl0JePvUTofYDF1TxEHYgarjcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73486,"logo_path":"/6CiuYMBxpBvuYnNTPFW7KsvNVAh.png","name":"Pacific Islanders in Communications","origin_country":"US"},{"id":73487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hawaii Public Television","origin_country":""},{"id":73488,"logo_path":null,"name":"LLB Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Then There Were None","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":189482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Lindsey","original_name":"Elizabeth Lindsey","popularity":0.1406,"profile_path":"/ubqfc1i48M9iyqe1libSkU74deO.jpg","credit_id":"56c9ad8fc3a36840910072be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":189482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Lindsey","original_name":"Elizabeth Lindsey","popularity":0.1406,"profile_path":"/ubqfc1i48M9iyqe1libSkU74deO.jpg","credit_id":"56c9adba92514130a90001fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martha Noyes","original_name":"Martha Noyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c9adec92514130a90001fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580905,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Robinson","original_name":"Rob Robinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c9ae0e92514130a9000208","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0220093","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1104,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hsl0JePvUTofYDF1TxEHYgarjcX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Then There Were None","key":"fAmK2LQ0sWc","published_at":"2008-06-19T19:17:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"56c9a71ec3a3684097007ded"}]}}}
