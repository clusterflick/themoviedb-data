But his happiness is short-lived. Marina only wants Gideon to pretend to be her boyfriend so she can investigate a séance as an undercover reporter. It turns out that Gideon and Marina aren’t the only ones with something to hide. Ramona, the not-so-typical medium, suspects there are hidden cameras and her creepy sidekick Errol keeps disappearing when the lights go out. Something’s unsettling about Marina’s editor, Trevor, and his timid wife, Helen. A dead woman’s daughter, Lily, is an unbalanced mess, and her boyfriend, David, is less of a rock and more of a stoner. When the séance turns south, a mournful spirit will ensure all of their buried secrets are brought to light.","popularity":0.211,"poster_path":"/9QWwoeqjR5k4F03XlkkOxcByevs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit Cabinet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Naito","original_name":"Jun Naito","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/xnGZNA3dthVmvw5pkTdEXdl2HDm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gideon","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d959","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Brock","original_name":"Marian Brock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d95d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":476555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Franklin","original_name":"Marina Franklin","popularity":0.1488,"profile_path":"/aUxvi30n1kk48fdavcSgV5JiXJT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d961","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Sands","original_name":"Mina Sands","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ramona","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d965","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Ryan","original_name":"Mickey Ryan","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d969","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Micari","original_name":"Mary Micari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d96d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Herbig","original_name":"Paul Herbig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"David","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d971","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Francini","original_name":"Joseph Francini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Erroll","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d975","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Stern","original_name":"Jay Stern","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/nlFkpjPibd2cHwr3qUKjXwrYCky.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db39251416c7513d94f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205599,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
