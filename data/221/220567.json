In addition to gazillions of press and radio interviews, and television appearances, the main event of the visit was the taping of a television special devoted entirely to ABBA. The special featured ABBA performing no less than 14 songs, three of which were performed live with a full orchestra backing, resulting in unique arrangements never used before or since. The television special, simply entitled ABBA Special, was subsequently released on VHS and laser-disc.","popularity":0.4539,"poster_path":"/aE7xt5svX6ixvr9pixTGDlDBc7Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1978-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ABBA In Japan","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ABBA Special","type":"Original onscreen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnetha Fältskog","original_name":"Agnetha Fältskog","popularity":0.3209,"profile_path":"/646ezF8wHWPoSWPWiSNUvZoL7d6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (Vocals)","credit_id":"52fe4dae9251416c7513d191","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anni-Frid Lyngstad","original_name":"Anni-Frid Lyngstad","popularity":0.6422,"profile_path":"/2bM3C2AiaIi7varkKweLXgYW4vj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Vocals)","credit_id":"52fe4dae9251416c7513d195","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Björn Ulvaeus","original_name":"Björn Ulvaeus","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/oPKcX8FVvbOnOqIaKovVOO55aIJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (Vocals / Guitar)","credit_id":"52fe4dae9251416c7513d199","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Andersson","original_name":"Benny Andersson","popularity":0.2414,"profile_path":"/eNzKMlaZh2d38iWUllcHQf8MUnY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (Vocals / Keyboards)","credit_id":"52fe4dae9251416c7513d19d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5252368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katsuhiko Fujii","original_name":"Katsuhiko Fujii","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b34f5fe9ee3dcc77e0dd4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1795,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aE7xt5svX6ixvr9pixTGDlDBc7Z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bfjZyH8sQnWFGJEywffZfvyHneb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
