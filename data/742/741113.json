Following the great French tradition, this opéra-comique has it all: 18th-century Rococo Parisian glamour and a perilous love story involving the dashing and flirtatious Chapelou and his opposite, the powerful and clever Madeleine. This lavish and spectacular production from the Opéra Comique in Paris received widespread critical acclaim and also features costumes by the iconic French fashion designer Christian Lacroix.","popularity":0.103,"poster_path":"/yF9VijWKDNNoL2tFoz9eKjB2nBt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra Comique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Postillon de Lonjumeau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2153831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Spyres","original_name":"Michael Spyres","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/ynfY9zhWR1edrzjvCmwg4Ml7B5Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chapelou / Saint-Phar","credit_id":"5f58e168c9dbf90034b3cbf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florie Valiquette","original_name":"Florie Valiquette","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Madeleine / Madame de Latour","credit_id":"5f58e170c9dbf90034b3cd48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2164457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franck Leguérinel","original_name":"Franck Leguérinel","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Le Marquis de Corcy","credit_id":"5f58e179e860170039047597","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Kubla","original_name":"Laurent Kubla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Biju / Alcidor","credit_id":"5f58e18105a533003820e0d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Fau","original_name":"Michel Fau","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/feskKEOsyrqZrnQr2LpmQvdXV2f.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"5f58e190befb09003656b97c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2771362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yannis Ezziadi","original_name":"Yannis Ezziadi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Louis XV","credit_id":"5f58e197befb090035578611","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Clément","original_name":"Julien Clément","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bourdon","credit_id":"66ead6f5b66746dd790b2cb7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680789,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sébastien Rouland","original_name":"Sébastien Rouland","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"66ead71db66746dd790b2ce7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Fau","original_name":"Michel Fau","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/feskKEOsyrqZrnQr2LpmQvdXV2f.jpg","credit_id":"5f58e1be5b2f470036d4f376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/woS8i37RZU09TjDaCgUFksTl5R6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yF9VijWKDNNoL2tFoz9eKjB2nBt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":786,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/arKfFYyI3kaZSE8EsXYeouFGclB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
