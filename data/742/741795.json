It grew out of an unusual process of interchange between the painter Jean Detheux and the composer Jean Derome. The result is a rare meeting of images and music. What we get is an intense meditation on a world in constant renewal, where every form that emerges is immediately engulfed by the next one. It constitutes a sort of diptych with the film Rupture, which follows. A film without words.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jgNuV7RuVMcXA5DdnN3DuU6DfHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liaisons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Detheux","original_name":"Jean Detheux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5be7c86af8f8003346be76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jgNuV7RuVMcXA5DdnN3DuU6DfHg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
