The inside is Belgium and its cultural codes. Consisting of a white box with a hidden entrance in the screen, only visible in some moments while the video is running, the installation creates a situation where inside and outside are obscured. The projection shows parts of the feature film Télé Réalité directed by Desamory, Glodie Mubikay, and Gustave Fundi: Three Congolese women are discussing a reality TV show they plan to produce in Belgium during carnival. When visitors enter the video screen, they find themselves in a secret chamber with a surveillance monitor. On it, strange characters evolve in the house where the brotherhood of the Blancs Moussis of Stavelot make and store tons and tons of confetti.","popularity":0.0548,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seen from the Outside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucile Desamory","original_name":"Lucile Desamory","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5b4ddc7ad08c0039557fb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
