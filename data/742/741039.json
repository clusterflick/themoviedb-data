It is still unclear whether Rossini was 14 or 18 when he wrote it; what is beyond doubt, however, is the anticipation of great things to come. The libretto is a far-fetched tale of feuding kings, mistaken identities, disguises and cruel fates typical of the late 18th-century opera seria. Young stage director Davide Livermore, heading a production of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino, turns the libretto into a ghost story, setting the action behind the stage of an opera house, when everyone has left and all that remains are the spirits of an opera that yearns for the breath of life much like the practically forgotten Demetrio e Polibio itself.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/p25Kvctw2BTSOYQ6i4riT5eL2Me.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossini Opera Festival","origin_country":""},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demetrio E Polibio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María José Moreno","original_name":"María José Moreno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588f71706b9f003a2b9b2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2771072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Zaytseva","original_name":"Victoria Zaytseva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588f79befb09003757b52a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2180574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yijie Shi","original_name":"Yijie Shi","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/uNwUByK2eX9ucn9kl4LzyOlzi6N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588f81befb09003856ee3e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirco Palazzi","original_name":"Mirco Palazzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588f882d93750036a16794","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Livermore","original_name":"Davide Livermore","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f588fa1706b9f003a2b9cbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2771073,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Corrado Rovaris","original_name":"Corrado Rovaris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f588f9705a53300381e6b3b","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p25Kvctw2BTSOYQ6i4riT5eL2Me.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
