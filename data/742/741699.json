In the course of telling his story, through his triumphs and travails, Jumonji emerges in this portrait as an adolescent innocent, much like skateboarding itself. He is irrepressible, manically energetic and ultimately, pure. He has a transcendent presence, well beyond charm or charisma, of such unalloyed joy that nothing he does is unforgiveable. This is fortunate because, as a drug addict, unsurprisingly, he lies, cheats and steals. Harry is rendered as the poet, the sprite, the artist and the street saint he is.","popularity":0.5516,"poster_path":"/l9boLsBhYwdXxVYWHfA1EY8rK0q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37432,"logo_path":"/4jf93b9QJmuHxtb1CAFxakApt5K.png","name":"Bow + Arrow
