The shipwreck resulted in the death of at least 43 people, making it the deadliest incident of that period, also known as “the long summer of migration.” One of the survivors, the artist Amel Alzakout, recorded the journey and the shipwreck on a waterproof camera attached to her wrist. This footage – which also forms the basis of her subsequent film Purple Sea – provides a unique situated perspective on this tragic event at the threshold of Europe.","popularity":0.1557,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":150573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forensic Architecture","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shipwreck at the Threshold of Europe, Lesvos, Aegean Sea: 28 October 2015","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2510308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amel Alzakout","original_name":"Amel Alzakout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da4215d100b6011c833532","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4212658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Pezzani","original_name":"Lorenzo Pezzani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da42bcf495ee0294312a59","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4212656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Heller","original_name":"Charles Heller","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da42abbf31f201cd50a4d8","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5b4cb463d9370036b1ffda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
