No matter how lucky, young or even in love we are, we bear our loneliness inside at all times. There is no escaping from it. Its lingering around during drunken parties in the dorms... Watching us... even when we are not in our own bed. The main character of this movie meets a girl who completely turns his world upside down as he is just beginning to learn how to find his inner peace. Her deliberate loneliness is a reassured protection from all the pain, lost hopes and disappointments. Not quite a love story, but more than just a story of someone's life! - Do you feel lonesome with me? - Of course.","popularity":0.0992,"poster_path":"/yMANPBZ3PzalmXxtcNyOC03Zyng.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101779,"logo_path":"/p9Wx4zJw8AI3Vp46KydNbFy5Cuy.png","name":"VKSR","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lonely Souls of Microbes","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Odinokie dushi mikrobov","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artem Klyuchnikov","original_name":"Artem Klyuchnikov","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/djXlq3WEZUQK53zKBRIGHUgpAz0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f59d1817ad08c003a50ad2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asya Domskaya","original_name":"Asya Domskaya","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/oMzm3S7lHpqmPRVupcm1mvx9I1a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f59d19fa294f0003925cab1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2772343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Levina","original_name":"Tatyana Levina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f59d1b15c324700371b5294","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2020163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yury Skulyabin","original_name":"Юрий Скулябин","popularity":0.344,"profile_path":"/oGtz470VoiPLkN5kKZG6EOfvbkK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f59d1cba294f0003826a6c7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Romanovsky","original_name":"Mikhail Romanovsky","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d1dd7ad08c003752371a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Romanovsky","original_name":"Mikhail Romanovsky","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d1fa5c324700371b53b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Maximov","original_name":"Maxim Maximov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d2180e44190038f855ee","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Petr Markichev","original_name":"Petr Markichev","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d26dec0c580038a2298f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2090372,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Svyatoslav Osipov","original_name":"Святослав Осипов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hrUS2zNsbInOvRjzC5JHEPXeKjN.jpg","credit_id":"5f59d28b7314a10036d9f279","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2772354,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anastasiya Ryazanova","original_name":"Anastasiya Ryazanova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d2c460c51d00374729ff","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Romanovsky","original_name":"Mikhail Romanovsky","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d2dd5bce9e0039c126bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2002108,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitaly Ivanchenko","original_name":"Vitaly Ivanchenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d2ea60c51d003a463da2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2474539,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Rizun","original_name":"Vladimir Rizun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f59d2f7079a970036b61027","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3954382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yMANPBZ3PzalmXxtcNyOC03Zyng.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/liDkTLsEbim77RsBnHfZ2u3GekV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Reflection Moscow Open Youth Film Festival","release_date":"2014-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
