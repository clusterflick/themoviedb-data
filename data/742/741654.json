An orbital facility of unknown origin. Here, the debt of taking a life will finally be repaid... through resurrection. The victims of military violence across time are systematically brought back to life and guided through the all-too-familiar facility. As a staff of identical ushers draws back layers of confusion and pain, the freshly resurrected gradually become aware of the reality of their corporeal reinsertion: perhaps the world of the living is not a world at all; to be alive in this place may merely be an exhibit. We, the resurrected, overwhelmed by a literal second life, will of course discover our one inevitable destination: a place to sit, have a drink, and talk it out.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A I O U","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Khalil","original_name":"Adam Khalil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5b4827fd7aa40039dc409d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Vidokle","original_name":"Anton Vidokle","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5b4861da10f0003690a530","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bayley Sweitzer","original_name":"Bayley Sweitzer","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5b485356b9f700347af0fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
