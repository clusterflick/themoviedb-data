After Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler himself had the most controversial scene cut, the film could be broadcast on television and triggered a lively discussion about the practical value of art.","popularity":0.0609,"poster_path":"/l3d9vauCOHcJwI9dnRgKjZ0Bmjg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84627,"logo_path":"/74qSw4gEVWDsK1gO0qwwhz2N4Ju.png","name":"Hochschule für Film und Fernsehen der DDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kollwitz and Her Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768700,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karin Döring","original_name":"Karin Döring","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6363abfe8289a00081c016ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Hasse","original_name":"Wolfgang Hasse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6363ac0969d2800082595580","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3768702,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christiane Kunow","original_name":"Christiane Kunow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6363ac17ecbde900825efca8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Hecht","original_name":"Werner Hecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5c902f6af8f800344a335d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christa Mühl","original_name":"Christa Mühl","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5c90271cc4ff0035b0119c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christa Mühl","original_name":"Christa Mühl","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5c8fd5bdc34c0039e9498e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cbAIEE1WHryggZmkmo9tzsHSLhL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l3d9vauCOHcJwI9dnRgKjZ0Bmjg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"DOK Leipzig 2022","release_date":"2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
