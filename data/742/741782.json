They are two strangers for whom the process of creation awakens intimacy that touches their very being. For the artist it is the need to go beyond appearances; for the model it is the refusal to look at the self. From scene to scene the film progresses, transforms, reconstructs the human interior landscape. A dramatic confrontation ensues.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/oRMCvEWHMoD2MyhAmfdP3f06fpj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Studio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Gervais","original_name":"Suzanne Gervais","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5bdd45da10f0003792dee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1386,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oRMCvEWHMoD2MyhAmfdP3f06fpj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":924}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
