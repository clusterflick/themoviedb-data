This is a surrealistic garden where the earth seethes with strange, unusual shapes and activity, accelerated in movement, compressed in time. Insect-like creatures dart under and over the sand with elusive swiftness; Picasso-like faces stare momentarily upward, mutate, and disappear; wilted blossoms become suddenly animated. What happens on the screen is punctuated and accompanied by synthetic sound effects.","popularity":0.0558,"poster_path":"/7aCcRClQhjFnzFfpDkWx5I8slY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2773923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Nutter","original_name":"Christopher Nutter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5bd4cb56b9f700377a027d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7aCcRClQhjFnzFfpDkWx5I8slY3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
