Originally set during Sicily's 13th-century uprising against French rule, in Christof Loy's staging for the Netherlands Opera the action is transposed to a 1940s world of sudden violence and shadowy double-dealing. Imaginatively cast and idiomatically conducted, the performance presents this magnificent score in its entirety, including the allegorical ballet The Four Seasons.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/zstS0qFrWTr6SlM7RG7sEDezj9z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":232,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giuseppe Verdi: Les vêpres siciliennes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Haveman","original_name":"Barbara Haveman","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f58b27c2d93750038a3f5a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burkhard Fritz","original_name":"Burkhard Fritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f58b2837a97ab00359fd580","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Marco-Buhrmester","original_name":"Alejandro Marco-Buhrmester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f58b2892d93750039a21c31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bálint Szabó","original_name":"Bálint Szabó","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f58b2917a97ab00339dfbde","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christof Loy","original_name":"Christof Loy","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f58b2a08c22c00038c9a8ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zstS0qFrWTr6SlM7RG7sEDezj9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
