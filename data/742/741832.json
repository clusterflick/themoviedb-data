Even when they decide to divorce, he meets the lawyers with a smile. When one of the attorneys suggests a charge of brutality, Mrs. Dorian points out that it is ludicrous. Dorian offers to have a party on his yacht, during which he will try very hard to be brutal to her to give her grounds for the divorce. Among the partygoers are Mrs. Dorian's guardian and Morgan, a smuggler who is buying the yacht. The guardian, who has squandered Mrs. Dorian's money on the stock market, kills himself. Dorian thinks that his wife killed him, gallantly takes the blame himself, and dives overboard. He becomes a tramp and is shanghaied by Morgan's men to become a stoker on his former yacht. Dorian's steward, Puck, is still onboard, and he tells Dorian that the guardian committed suicide.","popularity":0.2415,"poster_path":"/anOGxSDAYVG9B3QkPtQgTJnZgsB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rolfe Photoplays","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Showing the Odd Way Devised to Secure a Divorce and Its Interruption by Fate.","title":"Dorian's Divorce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Richard Dorian","credit_id":"5f5c10ff7314a10034dca999","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Valentine","original_name":"Grace Valentine","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/5p1JRGJfQ2xtAzdQ9wTRztg4HH4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Dorian","credit_id":"5f5c1104fd7aa4003be0290a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William B.
