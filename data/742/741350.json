It was also the year fans got to salute Jorge Lorenzo as the three-time World Champion called an end to his stellar MotoGP™ career. As one hero exited the pitlane, it looked as if another was entering. France’s Fabio Quartararo, aged just 20, took seven podium finishes and six pole positions in his first year of the premier class, securing fifth place in the World Championship overall. Andrea Dovizioso continued to impress on the Ducati and Maverick Viñales and Álex Rins led the charge for Yamaha and Suzuki respectively, so the season ended with four different manufacturers in the top four spots. MotoGP™ can always be relied on to deliver excitement and drama in spadefuls throughout the season and 2019 is certainly no exception.","popularity":0.5387,"poster_path":"/wGG0eJ7b88kk5V0SHJYUuTADkUZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":265,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MotoGP 2019 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"MotoGP Review 2019","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"MotoGP 2019 Official Review","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"MotoGP Official Review 2019","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1402369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Márquez","original_name":"Marc Márquez","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/sUZncER3y3nQM1IwRWkyYFszSMt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f59b75860b58d003885a4a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Lorenzo","original_name":"Jorge Lorenzo","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/hnqbhnNL7uMKwzTBD38iYeZP9Np.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f59b779ec0c580035a219f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Dovizioso","original_name":"Andrea Dovizioso","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/9dRrQ9ZJehqbG3XKZars5B8tQB7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f59b8fe079a970037b55546","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2771742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maverick Viñales","original_name":"Maverick Viñales","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/1114qPH0xKOXzRA4cQ7ibAMQXrI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f59b91aa294f00038261f7d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álex Rins","original_name":"Álex Rins","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/99v0Raq14z6kNhSQT5NjwV51ZKT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f59b9445c324700391b927a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Quartararo","original_name":"Fabio Quartararo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zwFJhXjV8PnMSao0mp3kBu2806f.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f59bf2460c51d003a45f71b","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wGG0eJ7b88kk5V0SHJYUuTADkUZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5DvqB0E1kfQAuiqCym4q3cs98Gc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3743,"name":"season"},{"id":9571,"name":"motor sport"},{"id":10039,"name":"racing"},{"id":14735,"name":"motorcycle"},{"id":210098,"name":"motogp"},{"id":242128,"name":"motorsport"},{"id":251645,"name":"motorbike"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-ray Release","release_date":"2020-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
