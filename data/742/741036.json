In 2011 the Rossini Festival in Pesaro presented the second staged performance of Adelaide di Borgogna since 1825. The story of the opera was taken from a historical event that took place in the medieval period, marking the end of an independent Italian kingdom and leading to the birth of the German Holy Roman Empire through the efforts of Otto I of Saxony. Caught between political rivalry and the love of two men, Adelaide of Burgundy struggles to fight for her people and chooses Otto, the better ruler, for herself and her kingdom.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/y9xAVDVgrx6rpPGMRbSmBUOsmno.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adelaide Di Borgogna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Barcellona","original_name":"Daniela Barcellona","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/zBDbRhpP62h9jolgaGXx2qSDjer.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588aa705a53300371d1b7a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1682064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Pratt","original_name":"Jessica Pratt","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/r3MXm90D0oLXigPC7zk9ctVQC68.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588aaf5b12400036902c15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogdan Mihai","original_name":"Bogdan Mihai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588ab9da10f0003a0f1e03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Ulivieri","original_name":"Nicola Ulivieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588ac1befb09003655a096","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannette Fischer","original_name":"Jeannette Fischer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f588acb5b1240003591a088","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2771061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dmitri Jurowski","original_name":"Dmitri Jurowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f588ad6befb09003757ab0a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier' Alli","original_name":"Pier' Alli","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f588ae3e86017003803e42b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y9xAVDVgrx6rpPGMRbSmBUOsmno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
