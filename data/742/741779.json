The film is divided into three sections--game, conflict and flirtation--that repeat themselves without seeming to do so.

A film without words.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":"/famdSDZAxKoIjmyqUjDl380ahFD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listen, You'll See...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636672,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gaston Sarault","original_name":"Gaston Sarault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5bda965c324700392340fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/famdSDZAxKoIjmyqUjDl380ahFD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
