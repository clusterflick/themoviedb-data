One day he accompanies a friend to the casting of an important film that will be shot in the city and so, almost by chance, he too finds himself taking part in the selections. In this circumstance, Francesco finds himself having to retrace the salient events of his life that made him the boy he is. The early loss of innocence due to a difficult childhood, marked by the drama of his mother's premature death and the harassment of an excessively authoritarian father, plunged him into the degraded context of street life. The subsequent encounters dragged him towards an impetuous and unruly adolescence, which led him first under the protection of social services and then to correctional institutions. Thanks to cinema, Francesco finds himself faced with the opportunity to completely change his life. Will he be able to seize it and redeem himself from an inexorable destiny, which seems to have already been written?","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":256479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associazione Culturale Mary Per
