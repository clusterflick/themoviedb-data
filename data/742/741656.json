The sound piece addresses the many forms of injustice that are symptomatic of aggressive policing, from direct physical violence on communities held suspect, or as systematic violence from a justice system that values certain lives, skin tones, and cultural groups over others.\r In Half Blue, Namy offers a space for contemplation, a space to honor those who have fallen victim to this type of injustice, and a space to celebrate strategies for coping and resilience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1151491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joe Namy","original_name":"Joe Namy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5b49a17314a10036dfbda4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
