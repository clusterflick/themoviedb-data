From April to June 2023, fishing and peasant communities, social movements and activists-artists and researchers from the Riverhood and River Commons projects engaged in local counter-mapping workshops on four rivers in Colombia and two in Ecuador: the Magdalena, La Miel, Bogot√° and, Sumapaz and the Guargalla y Alao rivers. By taking the mapping workshops and the maps themselves from one context to another, the different experiences and struggles were woven together, connecting stories, concerns, debates and movements. Rivers travelled and promoted transnational solidarity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of Travelling Rivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"River Commons Rio Viajeros Trailer","key":"910101624","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-05T16:32:20.000Z","id":"665851cd9ef4718ae693e37f"}]}}}
