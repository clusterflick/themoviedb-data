The painting is based on portraits of Yaroslavl residents from the distant past and Yaroslavl residents of the late twentieth century: workers, restorers, engineers, artists. The frame contains many recognizable places of the city, as well as courtyards, factories, and cultural institutions. This 10-minute film perfectly conveys the atmosphere of life in Yaroslavl in the mid-1980s.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/4TBjxgU8qOVEtitn2u2Wpc3KmH2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89930,"logo_path":"/ncWu4Fo1g4i5BRqnwATTKWm56bQ.png","name":"Leningrad Documentary Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1985-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yaroslavl Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Yaroslavskiy portret","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4261383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Semenyuk","original_name":"Виктор Семенюк","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/aRJS05KFyVfJ8kmzafgtbnnelkA.jpg","credit_id":"6658fb7f9ef4718ae693f1d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2304122,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Skvortsov","original_name":"Сергей Скворцов","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658fbf123d6cea1046c3560","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745593,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yevgeniy Bryukhanov","original_name":"Yevgeniy Bryukhanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658fbb84c1ad8d5306c2c6e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4261383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Semenyuk","original_name":"Виктор Семенюк","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/aRJS05KFyVfJ8kmzafgtbnnelkA.jpg","credit_id":"6658fb5adab77cca4e1d3313","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4TBjxgU8qOVEtitn2u2Wpc3KmH2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
