The film separates (and connects) two distinct states of being “[…] half hope, half fear; that a dog will become a wolf.” This interstitial state translates to a discontinuous editing style, alternating between different times and environments. The central motif is a tunnel. At a metaphorical level, the tunnel could serve as an exit from the unconscious or a means to descend into unknown depths.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hour Between Dog and Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3640382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pan Daijing","original_name":"Pan Daijing","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sBboqsoHA8xWxjiv3rWQY6PAxn8.jpg","credit_id":"6657cd7c9ef4718ae693c7f7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3640382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pan Daijing","original_name":"Pan Daijing","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sBboqsoHA8xWxjiv3rWQY6PAxn8.jpg","credit_id":"6657cf0548d202dec970d143","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3640382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pan Daijing","original_name":"Pan Daijing","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sBboqsoHA8xWxjiv3rWQY6PAxn8.jpg","credit_id":"6657cd6e1d04f3b44d2d086c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tai Kwun","release_date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
