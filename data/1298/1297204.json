On March 9, 2020, following the advance of COVID-19, the Italian Government orders mandatory self-isolation for all citizens.

Job insecurity, instability of affections, loneliness. Anna, Mamadou, Waleed and Ajmeen, Simone, Gil, Mother Myriam, Suon Daisy, Sister Milena, Regina and Gideon: a building in Turin becomes a single window onto many different and distant worlds, all united by the same uncertainty, the same concern for the future, the same refuge in the past and in the most intimate affections, to face the precariousness of the present.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/28hnYV60B2k0rOmcHBPZNlWi8S4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tutti I Nostri Affanni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869181,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Federico Palmerini","original_name":"Federico Palmerini","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6656f6dd1c28c61989b91eea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225436,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Davide Crudetti","original_name":"Davide Crudetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6656f6d1f17cf6c083a6f3c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4742407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paola Di Mitri","original_name":"Paola Di Mitri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66570320542a7939f8709974","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19883300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":887,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/28hnYV60B2k0rOmcHBPZNlWi8S4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
