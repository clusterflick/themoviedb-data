Luckily for Ava, however, her two best friends, Willow (Sophia Scott) and Ethan (Benno Hennig), are with her every step of the way… that is until an impromptu student body election ends up pitting Ava against Willow, with poor Ethan stuck in the middle. Through her adventure, Ava has to grapple with the opinions of those around her: a local business owner and classmate who struggles with human interaction (Anna Lupien), a people pleasing young teacher (Ben Hauptman), a doubtful and pessimistic principal (Tim Cunningham), and a mother who can never find the right words to say (Nanette Hennig Fraser). Ava will learn that becoming her own person is not just about stepping out of someone’s shadow, but about making hard choices even when you see no light at the end of the tunnel.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v7YtdSiAPVhBwHo0O5dyUjvbEzT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heartwood Regional Theater
