The two meet stuck in an escalator which seems infinite. Everybody walks a certain way, some stroll, some fast, and some even stop constantly either lost or contemplative. For Ratel, it says a lot about people and this is something that crosses her mind a lot. While she walks up an endless stairway, she stops and meets someone who makes her doubt how she perceives the world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La fonceuse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Auger","original_name":"Emma Auger","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66589a5c68635a7fb174e645","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skad","original_name":"Skad","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66589a67d03602f82967c0a3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Montesano","original_name":"Dominique Montesano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66589a333a32742591a61ef0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Montesano","original_name":"Dominique Montesano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66589a3ccd22f2f92e74e554","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Montesano","original_name":"Dominique Montesano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66589a42a2649378cb1d0e9e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryley Lapointe","original_name":"Ryley Lapointe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66589a4cbce2ac9689506134","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryley Lapointe","original_name":"Ryley Lapointe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66589a5197b7c5247574e90c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Image+Nation Festival Court Queer Short Film Fest","release_date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
