The energy of the gesture and the distortive effect of the double screen evoke a sinister prior event and a sense panic or fear. Here Nauman continues his ongoing investigation into human psychology and feelings of discomfort. The sense of anxiety is heightened by the echoing sound of the water draining away for the fifty-five-minute duration of the double footage.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/b1CNCoWJJKWOfDvG6JoZGLHvPDn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Washing Hands Normal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6658fbaa8e42e6dc246c2e11","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Nauman","original_name":"Bruce Nauman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658fbbd23d6cea1046c3559","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b1CNCoWJJKWOfDvG6JoZGLHvPDn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
