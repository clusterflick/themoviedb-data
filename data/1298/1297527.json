The ongoing existence of these establishments creates a paradox, making one ponder whether our aspirations for a substance-free community are hindered by a lack of faith or if such a transformation is not in line with what some believe to be God's plan. This situation brings to light the complex interplay between faith, societal goals, and the challenges associated with achieving a drug-free status.","popularity":0.1234,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jhewin Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Faith","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743646,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Austin Solomon Raj","original_name":"Austin Solomon Raj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6657d59bc347bfd0b3b77aed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jhewin Frank","original_name":"Jhewin Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6657d5a4aecabf7a69c4851e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvin Isaac","original_name":"Melvin Isaac","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6657d5bfdc1154cd74cd63a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelin Jenifer","original_name":"Angelin Jenifer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6657d5d607abad903fa8cc31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gifto Davi","original_name":"Gifto Davi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Andu","credit_id":"6657d5e568635a7fb174ce0f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jhewin Frank","original_name":"Jhewin Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6657d5869fb50d168872681d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jhewin Frank","original_name":"Jhewin Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6657d578c347bfd0b3b77a9f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jhewin Frank","original_name":"Jhewin Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6657d5272f924e740093d297","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743646,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Austin Solomon Raj","original_name":"Austin Solomon Raj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6657d54380bb46155fe21003","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743644,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jhewin Frank","original_name":"Jhewin Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6657d56723d6cea1046c1659","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743646,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Austin Solomon Raj","original_name":"Austin Solomon Raj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6657d55448d202dec970db7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30745973","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6150,"name":"faith"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
