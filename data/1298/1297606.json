Yang hates communicating with other people. Therefore, she has already kept herself inside her apartment for a whole year and eats rice with pork chop in each single day. Reading is the only hobby left for her. Lili Wu heard of Xu Yang from her parents who cook pork chop for Yang. One day, Lili, a girl who has trouble writing scripts, knocked on Yang’s door and entered her life. They started to know each other and found they were indeed complementary to each other: Lili knew how to write a script and Yang went out the door. Some feelings that were hard to define started to rise between them. However, the destiny of being apart was that hard to escape: Yang thought Lili was a betrayer after she knew the reason why Lili knocked on her door, while Lili thought Yang was a selfish coward.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/thfUNWUFOIpul3RLQTbBxug3owQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You, Written by Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuchen Shao","original_name":"Yuchen Shao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66581c50bce2ac96895057c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jingyao Yu","original_name":"Jingyao Yu","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66581c5953ebd5d68693de47","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiao Ni","original_name":"Jiao Ni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/fSZa0CWWwb4JNWLq8uFLsWGdsAB.jpg","credit_id":"66581c354c1ad8d5306c1b20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiao Ni","original_name":"Jiao Ni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/fSZa0CWWwb4JNWLq8uFLsWGdsAB.jpg","credit_id":"66581c3d23d6cea1046c2475","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/thfUNWUFOIpul3RLQTbBxug3owQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
