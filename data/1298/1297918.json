In the documentary, filmmaker Phil Schneider provides a compelling, insightful, and comprehensive look into Weiss' extraordinary life, and how, as a result of his crusading activism and \"speaking truth to power,\" he has inspired others to \"show up, stand up, and speak up\" in times of crisis. The film also explores the softer side of Rabbi Weiss and his relentless commitment to create an environment of inclusion and dignity for his community.","popularity":0.044,"poster_path":"/nASjerivxjhNzIMzmLelHB6Ikxx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Righteous Rebel: Rabbi Avi Weiss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avi Weiss","original_name":"Avi Weiss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66590594512f151cfa93f455","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"6659056297b7c5247574f1d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Justin Matley","original_name":"Justin Matley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66590576dab77cca4e1d33c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Justin Matley","original_name":"Justin Matley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659056d9ef4718ae693f282","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Schneider","original_name":"Phil Schneider","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665905578f75c3347a506a03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4169566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1295,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nASjerivxjhNzIMzmLelHB6Ikxx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":910}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
