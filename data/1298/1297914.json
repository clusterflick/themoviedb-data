A pickpocket cinema projectionist in Bologna, Italy, narrates three intertwining stories of tourists who visit his city one summer. A timid adjunct professor from Australia receives word from a mysterious stranger about his imminent death while nervously preparing to present his paper on the classic film Last Year at Marienbad. An apostate ex-priest gifts a naive and destitute young couple with a camcorder...for possibly lecherous purposes. And, lastly, the pickpocket projectionist narrator pursues his own adventure with a lovely but understandably cautious Icelandic girl.","popularity":0.2089,"poster_path":"/nEEK2kGzArvgREYBew6C8fYKlJi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The pickpocket lurks, and the projectionist works...in the dark.","title":"Next Week in Bologna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Victorine Van Der Burg","original_name":"Sophie Victorine Van Der Burg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alba","credit_id":"6659032adab77cca4e1d33ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raffaelo Rossini","original_name":"Raffaelo Rossini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"6659034abf4e331d736c2dae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Nilsson","original_name":"Rob Nilsson","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/kqMgOljEdjiXSo8iWuOZ75ccPTr.jpg","credit_id":"665903db2f924e740093f0ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raffaelo Rossini","original_name":"Raffaelo Rossini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659040e4c1ad8d5306c2d36","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745662,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Andrews","original_name":"Ben Andrews","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665903ffdd28a2224e93f986","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Nilsson","original_name":"Rob Nilsson","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/kqMgOljEdjiXSo8iWuOZ75ccPTr.jpg","credit_id":"665902b1ff1b2e5e2c2d3212","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745659,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vivek Venkatraman","original_name":"Vivek Venkatraman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66590392a9aadc2d322d3824","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"665902bd68635a7fb174ee52","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745657,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aleks Rydzkowska","original_name":"Aleks Rydzkowska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659037646f30f137474f1bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5565174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.735,"height":1322,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nEEK2kGzArvgREYBew6C8fYKlJi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":972}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
