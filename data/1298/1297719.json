Hollywood no longer wanted to know about Frank Sinatra, he divorced his wife Nancy in 1951 to marry the actress Ava Gardner, \"the most beautiful woman in the world\" and he went to Las Vegas to get his career going again. But in 1952 he was fired from Columbia Pictures.. A year later he was in Sweden on tour and performed in Finspång. Only 537 turned up.The ticket was a whopping SEK 4 against the normal 1:50.
