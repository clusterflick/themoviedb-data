The film explains the Rabbi’s political and religious points of view, while exposing behind-the-scenes stories of historical events in Israel and the Rabbinical influence on them.  Although perceived as a controversial persona throughout his life, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef was with no doubt a leading image in the religious world, as a rabbinical decision maker who often ruled with creativity, originality, and surprisingly liberal in his approach and understanding of modern day life. The film tracks his path in becoming a powerful religious leader.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King of the Sephardim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4744388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ofer Panchasov","original_name":"Ofer Panchasov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665858b4dc8efee4671d1adf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"MA 15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"Docaviv","release_date":"2024-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
