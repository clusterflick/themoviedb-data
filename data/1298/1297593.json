Living alone, she self-medicates using homemade opiates mixed with alcohol. The potent concoction causes hallucinatory flashbacks to her life as one of the ‘Unknowns’ an elite IRA unit that interrogated and killed suspected informers, burying them in the surrounding countryside. Haunted by the daily visitations, her private torment is further disturbed by the arrival of a teenaged boy, who bears a striking resemblance to one of her victims: an infiltrator whom she had once loved. A fervent young recruit, on the run after accidentally shooting a girl in a Derry riot, needing a place to hide. Erin allows him to stay and, as she deteriorates, the boy becomes her carer and confessor, an unready witness to her fight with her relentless demons.","popularity":0.4598,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":189612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Reckoning of Erin Morrigan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olwen Fouéré","original_name":"Olwen Fouéré","popularity":0.3003,"profile_path":"/jvBLYkqqEdZGGcg4YVUZhBl6or4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Erin Morrigan","credit_id":"66580e540e3589ad5c5055dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4729582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Doyle","original_name":"Jake Doyle","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Boy","credit_id":"66580e69dc8efee4671d1484","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2208341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aidan O'Callaghan","original_name":"Aidan O'Callaghan","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/jIqbGCqzGmwjhzxc14nN3kC6hD2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Col","credit_id":"66580e727afa4b9bdba8de20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2937771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciara Ivie","original_name":"Ciara Ivie","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Young Erin","credit_id":"66580e802c7537f5811d1081","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabrielle Russell","original_name":"Gabrielle Russell","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66580e2d21aff2d3d9b4363d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabrielle Russell","original_name":"Gabrielle Russell","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66580e3683229c42deb436be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Torenbeek","original_name":"Laura Torenbeek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66580e47dc8efee4671d147a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22188462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14552,"name":"ira (irish republican army)"},{"id":258990,"name":"personal demons"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
