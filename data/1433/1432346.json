These are Japanese macaques, the northernmost population of monkeys in the world. Highly adaptable, they are the only primates to inhabit environments that range from low coastal plains to mountainous areas 3,000 meters above sea level, with temperatures that can drop to -30 degrees Celsius. How is this single species of macaque able to thrive in such widely diverse habitats? Shot in beautiful 4K UHD, the cameras travel through Japan to capture unique monkey groups displaying different localized food habits, including a world-first footage of monkeys catching live fish as well as how such new behaviors spread among individuals in the pack.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/2hGRorEkYMXZvcnVBOGWDvy4Xry.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meet the real \"snow monkeys.\"","title":"Mighty Monkeys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kosuke Hayashi","original_name":"Kosuke Hayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aa4e015bd9fe5057b07e29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2hGRorEkYMXZvcnVBOGWDvy4Xry.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
