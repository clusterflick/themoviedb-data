Their fate takes an unexpected turn when they hear an interview with a successful disabled filmmaker, whose story inspires them. Abandoning their initial plan, they decide to make a film instead.  \"Just One Chance\" explores how human abilities can shift depending on the context: a strength in one situation may become a weakness in another, and vice versa. Turning a disability into a professional asset is possible... all it takes is just one chance.","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":"/rDDUIzB3LjSSywWb6FI92ygd1NB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just One Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238255,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Quentin Alitta","original_name":"Quentin Alitta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9ff1bee5189f50a0f7a5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238255,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Quentin Alitta","original_name":"Quentin Alitta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9ff25ee5189f50a0f7a67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rDDUIzB3LjSSywWb6FI92ygd1NB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
