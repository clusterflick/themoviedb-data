The Oilers gambled on hiring Bum Phillips, an unconventional East Texas coach known for cowboy hats, ostrich boots, and folksy one-liners. Ditching tradition and embracing a family-first atmosphere, Bum brought in 'misfits' and 'has-beens' to build a winner. At its peak, Bum’s Oilers blew up into the Luv Ya Blue!’ phenomenon, with Earl Campbell and the Oilers going to war with a Pittsburgh Steelers dynasty. Bum’s success on and off the field, his humanity and unique style left a legacy now carried forward by many, including his son and grandson, celebrated coaches Wade and Wes Phillips.","popularity":1.1712,"poster_path":"/svKTdn5O8eKLQo1uXnx8i2Vmbrp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luv Ya Bum!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1214288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wade Phillips","original_name":"Wade Phillips","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ab9eeedd9b7d2eaab0a800","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Phillips","original_name":"Wes Phillips","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ab9efe5bd9fe5057b0a567","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Bradshaw","original_name":"Terry Bradshaw","popularity":0.5115,"profile_path":"/Ac73x82PWueEEPUlX7hpauN9pxJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67ab9f0a4ec593aea5bb0853","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.J.
