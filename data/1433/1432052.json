The central characters include, Jimmy Rey, the suave but offbeat observer of events, Rosa, a sultry dancer in a red sequin dress, and her boyfriend Jose패, an intimidating gangster who cannot dance.  Tempers flare when Rosa's former flame Guy Valdez arrives on the scene complete with entourage and much macho posing to challenge Jose패 to a knife fight.  Later, Guy is stabbed to death by an unknown killer.  Accompanying the action are the sensuously choreographed routines of the club's dancers","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Note: This short film is lost media.","title":"A Deadly Dance","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Panebianco","original_name":"Patricia Panebianco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67a9cbd98b718b66c50f7bb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesus Felipe","original_name":"Jesus Felipe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67a9cbe22fbac40b909377fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4046810,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fabio Urena","original_name":"Fabio Urena","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67a9cbf06ca81546040f75fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose패 Martin Pacheco","original_name":"Jose패 Martin Pacheco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67a9cbf91ca858ae1106116f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Wynn","original_name":"Tim Wynn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"67a9cc05d15e4f3d94936f4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dark Gable Most","original_name":"Dark Gable Most","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"67a9cc0d1ca858ae11061191","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5237833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Caraballo","original_name":"Richard Caraballo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a99f3d0bf46f8e880f777d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5237833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Caraballo","original_name":"Richard Caraballo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cb112fbac40b90937729","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238004,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Perez","original_name":"John Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cb2316b972753a061184","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238005,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"George Alonso","original_name":"George Alonso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cb50b4129a41b0060bea","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5237833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Caraballo","original_name":"Richard Caraballo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cb632fbac40b9093774c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238008,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Perez","original_name":"John Perez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cb7a2fbac40b90937765","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238004,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Perez","original_name":"John Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cb9bd15e4f3d94936f24","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Gonzalez","original_name":"Jerry Gonzalez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a9cbacd15e4f3d94936f27","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
