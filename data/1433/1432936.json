Nika is known for her chameleon-like ability to transform her voice, while Saya has a melancholic and straightforward singing style. Both have distinct voices that can be identified immediately, but when they sing in unison, they create melodies that are truly sublime. They have released charming album IPIYA (2005) features playful pop songs reminiscent of nursery rhymes, repetitive mantra-like tracks. The two went back and forth from their homes in Hiroshima and Tokyo to create beautifully diverse songs for this record. This is the documentary of \"how\" and \"why\" and also \"where\" they had made the very original music. Many interviews, rehearsals, free sessions, live performances are included. There is a childlike innocence to this documentary, and offers a peak into the unique world of how they make music.","popularity":0.2819,"poster_path":"/2J3EUmaDZrua9jXnQ0hx2aSCcb7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harmonies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241537,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saya Source","original_name":"Saya Source","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Saya Source","credit_id":"67abdb28518408abf8bb4370","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241540,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nika Soup","original_name":"Nika Soup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nika Soup","credit_id":"67abdb33518408abf8bb437a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shogo Motomiya","original_name":"Shogo Motomiya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abda80e09d6c9190b08b17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241537,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saya Source","original_name":"Saya Source","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abdabea2e2f99ed4bb5105","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241540,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nika Soup","original_name":"Nika Soup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abdacde09d6c9190b08b42","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/trYh3axH7OrKKCTCZDQywCWYT3Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2J3EUmaDZrua9jXnQ0hx2aSCcb7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":637,"name":"pop"},{"id":202519,"name":"j-pop"},{"id":204382,"name":"freestyle"},{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
