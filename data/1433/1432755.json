By making his cancer the subject of an opera, premiering on the largest German-speaking theater, he is putting the art district under pressure: a wonderful institution like the Burgtheater must use its artistic resources lavishly to reveal the entire \"truth\" about us humans.  At the end of the day, when the scenery on Janina Audick's revolving stage has finally come to rest, when Isolde's last Liebestad has been sung enchantingly beautifully by Elfriede Rezabek and indescribable jubilation breaks out, then Schlingensief is completely alone with his illness.","popularity":0.3178,"poster_path":"/iGSUENj2RiDMHnB0TZQNGDvLND8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hoanzl","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mea Culpa – A ReadyMadeOpera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margit Carstensen","original_name":"Margit Carstensen","popularity":0.2414,"profile_path":"/3o7Nl96wQI7WRMI1beZwGtLCcKz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab90cd47051c54beb0bf2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerda Cerne","original_name":"Gerda Cerne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab90e4f71a3783e1bb3103","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritzi Haberlandt","original_name":"Fritzi Haberlandt","popularity":0.3119,"profile_path":"/xx2zbZBCNWYBI1oD1QT5WLzQgbC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab90fcf71a3783e1bb310b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4282570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sachiko Hara","original_name":"Sachiko Hara","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wJWe3ClLsS6BTHSQbE487bWtDpI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab9112f71a3783e1bb3127","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friederike Harmsen","original_name":"Friederike Harmsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab913ef71a3783e1bb3148","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab914db274e6a7d1bb2d5c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carina-Roxana Isima","original_name":"Carina-Roxana Isima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab9162f71a3783e1bb3163","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Kieran","original_name":"Lynne Kieran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab91876be6ab6e139ba76b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myorah B.
