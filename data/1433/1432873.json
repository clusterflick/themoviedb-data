Through research conducted with The Peregrine Fund, Chris helped discover that lead fragments from bullets in remains of shot animals left afield are often accidentally eaten by eagles, condors, and other scavengers. As a lifelong hunter who’s proud of the role that hunters have played in conservation, Chris is spearheading a partnership that works with hunters to voluntarily remove lead from the food chain. His efforts have shown hunters' willingness to participate at the local level, and he is now attempting to spread this message to the broader hunting community. Told through a deer hunt with friend Ben Masters, the film aims to showcase hunters taking the lead on an important issue, thus continuing the hunter’s tradition of conservation.","popularity":0.1831,"poster_path":"/fSq8zFGQfdG7JaOBmk2fEaq7WAJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lead it Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip Baribeau","original_name":"Phillip Baribeau","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abc090a2e2f99ed4bb4cb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Masters","original_name":"Ben Masters","popularity":0.1584,"profile_path":"/7IVrvFC8fTlQqQuFKCDKjVaz9VG.jpg","credit_id":"67abc0a0a2e2f99ed4bb4cbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fSq8zFGQfdG7JaOBmk2fEaq7WAJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
