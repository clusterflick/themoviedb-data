Starting in 2002, Guillaume Castagné and Sylvain Quément have continuously created their own universe of deviant cartoons and Technicolor anthems. After having toured extensively throughout the world, their synaesthetic creations can now be enjoyed for the first time on DVD. The resulting 18 animated music films are packed with bastardised objects: cowboys armed with petrol guns pursue Indians with hot dog shooters; Chinese labourers produce the toys for a new generation of tech hipsters; and man and machine are embroiled in perpetual self-destruction. Melodies crush and rebuild in various styles, mixing sources dug out deep from a huge digital sandbox: coconut swings, cinematic Italian synths, ghetto can sounds and imaginary folklore.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind the Technicolor frenzy and DIY entertainment, an absurd and uncanny dimension unfolds: Eat technology before technology eats you!","title":"Gangpol & Mit: Faits Divers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
