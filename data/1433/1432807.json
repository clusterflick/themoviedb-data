It highlights the perception that marijuana is less harmful than harder drugs and reflects on the challenges park rangers face in enforcing drug laws. While acknowledging the existence of drug trafficking, the narrative emphasizes that marijuana use is often seen as a minor issue compared to alcohol consumption or harder narcotics.
