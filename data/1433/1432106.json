Together with his fiancee Angela Boone, Keith sculpts intricate but impermanent artworks for catered affairs, hotels, cruise ships and for advertising promotions.

At the contest site, the young man joins scores of other chainsaw-wielding sculptors busily freeing their creations from blocks of ice.
