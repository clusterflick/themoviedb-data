Pūras, has dedicated his life to working diligently at the Žiežmariai clinic. He is not a doctor, yet the institution’s daily operations would be unimaginable without him—he is a jack-of-all-trades: driver, electrician, plumber. He performs every task willingly and joyfully, never engaging in conflict with others or himself, never questioning whether helping someone will bring him any benefit. He simply works, and that brings him satisfaction. Šablevičius portrays a man who maintains his optimism and inner clarity in any situation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6wCZnwYcFhBbA7YK5IHCYeuDMza.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lietuvos Kinostudija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything is going well","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","original_name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/4wuCB6GF8vHcHjdr3QUQyFhlwbV.jpg","credit_id":"67ab4c32a2e2f99ed4bb370b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","original_name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/4wuCB6GF8vHcHjdr3QUQyFhlwbV.jpg","credit_id":"67ab4c3e8d58dd6133b0a40b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","original_name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ab4c4ca2e2f99ed4bb3712","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1019,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6wCZnwYcFhBbA7YK5IHCYeuDMza.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
