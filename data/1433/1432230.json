It is both land art and a memorial to the town of Gibellina that was devastated by an earthquake in January 1968. Itâ€™s a work by the Italian artist Alberto Burri. He covered the ruins of the town with white cement and fissures function as pathways that wind through an area of roughly 20 acres. Petra Noordkamp captures Il Grande Cretto di Gibellina by Alberto Burri as an experentiental work of art filled with a sense of place and history.","popularity":0.4168,"poster_path":"/q4Mfh2gpqScSWIqZPBh1CYzyrxb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253077,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Solomon R.
