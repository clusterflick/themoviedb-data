The project was shot at the site of where a close friend of mine passed away in a car accident about a year prior. Through both its form and content, the film poetically speaks on the medium of cinema and its relationship to the internet age, the apocalypse, and the different forms of death we are subjected to. As much as this film is about the future of cinema, it is just as much grappling with the future of death.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/qXu00W1ovkzRBmRqaVPMzZqB4qM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Images of a Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Parsley","original_name":"Connor Parsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jGLmCySSFGlDGjTyDVOgQ63jaFP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67aba1b16be6ab6e139babc2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Parsley","original_name":"Connor Parsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jGLmCySSFGlDGjTyDVOgQ63jaFP.jpg","credit_id":"67aba1947c9910814f9bba85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXu00W1ovkzRBmRqaVPMzZqB4qM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
