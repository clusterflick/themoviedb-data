For millennia, they looked after the rock country, taking care of it for their ancestors and their children. Fire was one of their main tools and Bininj Nawarddeken actively burned areas of the savanna grasslands woodlands and rainforests to protect them from large, devastating wildfires. But in the late 18th century, British colonialization disrupted the Bininj Nawarddeken’s connection to the land and their traditional use of fire. The result was the spread of massive wildfires that decimated pristine ecosystems.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/eYDdGsLVwwANnGmpjZaIFxGQieT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Going Home Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Munuggullumurr Yibarbuk","original_name":"Dean Munuggullumurr Yibarbuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abc1d27c9910814f9bbc1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Munuggullumurr Yibarbuk","original_name":"Dean Munuggullumurr Yibarbuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abc1d95c0e67e56bbb410d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Masters","original_name":"Emma Masters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abc1eaf71a3783e1bb38f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5241307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Masters","original_name":"Emma Masters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abc1f4f71a3783e1bb3904","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eYDdGsLVwwANnGmpjZaIFxGQieT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
