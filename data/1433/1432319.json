Armed with thorough data, biologists and activists bring a new proposal to state authorities, hoping to regain protections for wolves near the park boundary. But local trappers are adamantly opposed. Hanging in the balance are some of America’s most iconic animals and wild places.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ov4Cf9QiiKEjKyWthFRCsnSYkwT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Good Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramey Newell","original_name":"Ramey Newell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aa42584e849060301d7734","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ov4Cf9QiiKEjKyWthFRCsnSYkwT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
