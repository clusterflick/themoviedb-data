In the fragile society that remains, humans have learned to coexist with their extraterrestrial invaders. But for Max, survival isnâ€™t enough. His older daughter, Greta, is dying from the disease. As her body weakens, an alien Sentinel lurks outside their home, drawing nearer and nearer as Greta takes her final breaths. This silent, unyielding predator is on a mission to collect her body to fulfill an unstoppable metamorphosis ritual. The government sanctions it. Society accepts it. But Max refuses to have anything else taken from him.","popularity":0.6524,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":183234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dogbone Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":82552,"logo_path":"/cLEXKtCpRQs0meQwT7HK6u3QmRH.png","name":"Elevation Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3528,"logo_path":"/cCzCClIzIh81Fa79hpW5nXoUsHK.png","name":"Thunder Road","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Dreadnought","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Bautista","original_name":"Dave Bautista","popularity":4.027,"profile_path":"/snk6JiXOOoRjPtHU5VMoy6qbd32.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67ab2a005c0e67e56bbb2ef2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cary Murnion","original_name":"Cary Murnion","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/nmBhLqmIRJoqHOKgkWKrSiASEdc.jpg","credit_id":"67ab28d19d346d3ef49ba96e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Milott","original_name":"Jonathan Milott","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/nJjtDqT3ZoEafHBnYIXdwRMS6bP.jpg","credit_id":"67ab28efdd9b7d2eaab09956","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Greenberg","original_name":"Joseph Greenberg","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ab2903dd9b7d2eaab09962","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67759,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Basil Iwanyk","original_name":"Basil Iwanyk","popularity":0.4174,"profile_path":"/pvHAcYM1UC30XMqOSOF7Gc2nmBh.jpg","credit_id":"67ab2915f71a3783e1bb2227","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1932093,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erica Lee","original_name":"Erica Lee","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":"/pJwTBgsAUrITBRmi0WIKanwDN5P.jpg","credit_id":"67ab2923f71a3783e1bb222e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2331572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Ross Jallet","original_name":"Jason Ross Jallet","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/1gd9IigmoRuHJkLDrq7cVrZZfh0.jpg","credit_id":"67ab29366eb36d0dad9ba260","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636994,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Bronfman","original_name":"Jonathan Bronfman","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/dul8wf1t6Tbo3n8H5SRR1hlyNYB.jpg","credit_id":"67ab294947051c54beb0abb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006949,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Bronfman","original_name":"Andrew Bronfman","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/825TENqXDs8jo8h8iMqPinXl6k6.jpg","credit_id":"67ab29585c0e67e56bbb2eb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Bautista","original_name":"Dave Bautista","popularity":4.027,"profile_path":"/snk6JiXOOoRjPtHU5VMoy6qbd32.jpg","credit_id":"67ab296d5c0e67e56bbb2ebf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240200,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Daniels","original_name":"Ashley Daniels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ab2980dd9b7d2eaab0997b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noah Segal","original_name":"Noah Segal","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":"/dSf7zf1dBn44mbOd2XcWTak8Rww.jpg","credit_id":"67ab2990f71a3783e1bb226b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35697420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
