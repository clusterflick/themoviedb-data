Armed with a small camera attached to her wheelchair, she sets off on a journey across the country together with her friend Pini Newirth, also a polio child, to unfold and reclaim the story of the children affected by the Polio epidemic. In a futile attempt to rebuild their bodies so they could walk, the children were subjected to excruciating medical procedures with no parents or family at their side. But growing up together forged a group of remarkable, self-driven women and men with disabilities who eventually launched the Disability Rights movement in Israel.","popularity":0.2171,"poster_path":"/xkwj5LnQ63dpl76WxZrnqjWG5uT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":253181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sadot North
