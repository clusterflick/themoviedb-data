She spends her days sleepless and her nights alone, watching video's on the internet of trains in Norway. She is harassed daily by an American who calls her and claims she still owes him a large amount of money. Her only escape is her hypnotizing electronic music. One night she meets another likely and meandering soul, Ajab. Soon they form a strong and special connection. In a world where almost all meaning seems to be superficial, Ajab's arrival finally makes Astrid feel a sense of purpose.","popularity":0.2265,"poster_path":"/pTQHEUMpMr57WhLfGYwP3FXa7Z2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infinite Drift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte De Bruyne","original_name":"Charlotte De Bruyne","popularity":0.3124,"profile_path":"/aO2UwodbEpQ4SgyrFTZuKnkfxF5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Astrid","credit_id":"67aa11c4f54bc6c5ba0f7ccf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Sack","original_name":"Adrian Sack","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/A0i6Vcqh9IGoZklThHEm8IcMlhJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ajab","credit_id":"67aa11d2b01153d6f49383a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5238399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Hatch","original_name":"Zach Hatch","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Loan shark (voice)","credit_id":"67aa11fbb01153d6f49383cc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Kurpershoek","original_name":"Sophie Kurpershoek","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aa11a1f54bc6c5ba0f7cad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Kurpershoek","original_name":"Sophie Kurpershoek","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aa11b3d12793743f93849b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170347,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Xavier Van D’Huynslager","original_name":"Xavier Van D’Huynslager","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aa1254b01153d6f4938406","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229344,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pieter De Naegel","original_name":"Pieter De Naegel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67aa12abb01153d6f493845e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5799176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pTQHEUMpMr57WhLfGYwP3FXa7Z2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
