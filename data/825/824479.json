He brutally invades Mooky's life and turns it upside-down. During Mookys teenage years, which are affected by his seductive mother Tinka, he deals with unfulfilled love for one girl and a dominated relationship with another. One day Mooky returns to his mother's home, deranged, and does something from which there is no turning back. Twenty years later, Mooky must decide whether to attend his mother's funeral and re-open his wounds of the past.","popularity":0.2566,"poster_path":"/jAPZ6Yw4ujIHKp6jSTntwaQ2y4a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Mooki","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehuda Almagor","original_name":"Yehuda Almagor","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":"/x9kKFR4qCTkZE5yC0lrf3g965Ah.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Janek","credit_id":"608c57c7c5840d0077950613","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1096634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Efrat Ben-Zur","original_name":"Efrat Ben-Zur","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/wGYFQazclk08vBWURFqX2Opiofr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tenka","credit_id":"608c57d6a61de100291b4e94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoav Koresh","original_name":"Yoav Koresh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mooki","credit_id":"608c57ec66469a00716f91c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1069224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sivan Levy","original_name":"Sivan Levy","popularity":0.1694,"profile_path":"/nYx3lDMF8UY9dXBphOiJjw6Eib8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Rocha","credit_id":"608c57fc8c40f700291d04b8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eran Riklis","original_name":"Eran Riklis","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/1pCAzdpi1oGUF5tgaHNrIwBPZm5.jpg","credit_id":"608c5839764841002bb9d922","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733556,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bracha Zisman-Cohen","original_name":"Bracha Zisman-Cohen","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c585d07e281002a8a09c8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mosh Danon","original_name":"Mosh Danon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c582da61de100291b4f25","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1435783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slava Chaplin","original_name":"סטניסלב צ'פלין","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c5809a61de100291b4ef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2565198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lena Chaplin","original_name":"Lena Chaplin","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c5814764841005957110d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1019885,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Moshe Zonder","original_name":"Moshe Zonder","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c581f67e0f7006fb53cad","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itai Neeman","original_name":"Itai Neeman","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455181e33ad8f01380e284d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1514822","wikidata_id":"Q52837117","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAPZ6Yw4ujIHKp6jSTntwaQ2y4a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
