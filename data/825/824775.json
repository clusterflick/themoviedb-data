He personifies the nihilistic philosophy of Albert Marcuse and tries to manipulate her. Her dependence on him forces her to reassess all the values of her art and life. We observe these events at three levels; a woman writer uses them as the basis of a play and in the process reveals parallels in her own experience.","popularity":0.2671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Marcuse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":189231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Craig","original_name":"Diane Craig","popularity":0.2985,"profile_path":"/yeGlal2pJwctp8e9F8jZYGLRM3H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Liz","credit_id":"608d738d5b4fed00597b5f7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penne Hackforth-Jones","original_name":"Penne Hackforth-Jones","popularity":0.2471,"profile_path":"/n3VHcR8wnPXJwpNi8RShEF2W66C.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gillian","credit_id":"608d739bc5840d0057637626","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grigor Taylor","original_name":"Grigor Taylor","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Warren","credit_id":"608d73a87b7b4d0057dc40a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1842291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Whitney","original_name":"David Whitney","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/jwqwal5v8eRkmjfPlihj2uLlij0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"608d73b820af77003f722b61","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Kemp","original_name":"Jim Kemp","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ron","credit_id":"608d73edc433ea0079dfcbcd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2721069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Hopkins","original_name":"Muriel Hopkins","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"608d740071ffdf007776bae1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Warrington","original_name":"Carmen Warrington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"608d7411221ba6007c69f38e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3075073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Phillips","original_name":"Anna Phillips","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Sally Tate","credit_id":"608d744a9e4012006f3b96ea","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3075075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Maddock","original_name":"Margaret Maddock","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Elly","credit_id":"608d745a20af77003f722bc4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2308120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Mason","original_name":"Paul Mason","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Laurence","credit_id":"632f5fa2fcec2e007cb6af2b","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3075061,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alma De Groen","original_name":"Alma De Groen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608d736bc433ea0079dfcaef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Burke","original_name":"Alan Burke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608d737cac41610029b8fddc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Robinson","original_name":"Ted Robinson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608d735a7b7b4d00295bb255","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0377333","wikidata_id":"Q15039373","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
