An elderly man and a younger woman examine a painting whilst repeatedly conversing dryly about its use of colour and brushstrokes. Only once you step into either protagonist are you whisked away to perhaps the strangest reality in existence: someone elseâ€™s interior life.  The latter is depicted as two small rooms full of paintings and objects. Stream-of-consciousness texts provide hints as to their real responses to the painting, where these arise and how they interrelate. The same painting can be seen through the windows, but many times bigger and deformed in other ways too. The dimensions game makes the relativism of our observations tactile.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Image Technology Echoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Moffatt","original_name":"Lauren Moffatt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608b203b81a7fc003f28308c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
