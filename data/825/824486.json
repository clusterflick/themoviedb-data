By day she drives a city bus; at night she studies the humanities in a tuition-free course. Her classmate Carl Chandler, a community elder, is the class’s intellectual leader.  White suburban filmmaker James Rutenbeck documents the students’ engagement with the humanities. He looks for transformations but is awakened to the violence, racism and gentrification that threaten Kafi and Carl's very place in the city.  Troubled by his failure to bring the film together, he enlists the pair as collaborators with a share in the film revenues. Five years on, despite many obstacles, Kafi and Carl arrive at surprising new places in their lives—and James does too.","popularity":0.7045,"poster_path":"/bYsh82Ua0jrE6LeO6xyGryQmxGa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lost Nation Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":85095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Lens","origin_country":"US"},{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Reckoning in Boston","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kafi Dixon","original_name":"Kafi Dixon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"608f432b629b2c00294d2da8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073806,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carl Chandler","original_name":"Carl Chandler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"608f4337871b34003f98ccf9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1961357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Rutenbeck","original_name":"James Rutenbeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6096d4b47f0540003dbd88c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Cheng","original_name":"Jack Cheng","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6096d6019661fc003b9aa2cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tolga Shields","original_name":"Tolga Shields","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6096d6543dd126003ef014d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Legas","original_name":"Julia Legas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6096d66454508d003b0e250a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3083515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim McCarthy","original_name":"Tim McCarthy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6096d67000bfe8003cd4bb95","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nate May","original_name":"Nate May","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608f4193a06efe002aa1d26c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2498900,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heather Merrill","original_name":"Heather Merrill","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608f4d6bfdc4fa0029d26557","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Fischer","original_name":"Diana Fischer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608f4d8138469a002a2eae71","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1245570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lois Vossen","original_name":"Lois Vossen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608f4f1baafebd0058b82eee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073806,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carl Chandler","original_name":"Carl Chandler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c5b73258823005704c493","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Llewellyn M.
