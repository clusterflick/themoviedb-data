But where does Mélisande come from? And what do we really know about the two heroes' silent love?  A single opera was all it took for Debussy to transform the history of music forever. Opéra de Lille presents us with a Mélisande full of vitality and determination, far from the familiar ethereal figure. In the pit, François-Xavier Roth and his internationally renowned ensemble Les Siècles, playing on period instruments, lend new colours to a score which we thought we knew.","popularity":0.084,"poster_path":"/A38Fi3T4h5VACIcpFjVq5yg9zow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas et Mélisande - Opéra de Lille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Behr","original_name":"Julien Behr","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"608aac9225882300785919d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vannina Santoni","original_name":"Vannina Santoni","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/7TFSWMzkEWQhPpAHNyTMPfxbP4y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"608aac9a946318002b128d2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3072069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Duhamel","original_name":"Alexandre Duhamel","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"608aaca138520200788f80ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1562699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Ange Todorovitch","original_name":"Marie-Ange Todorovitch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/50c71uyUqQdXgoBT2gzb5o5uZgl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"608aaca8946318007a116f2f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Teitgen","original_name":"Jean Teitgen","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"608aacaf2588230040b0f4ad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Pass","original_name":"Damien Pass","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"608aacb667e0f70029d781f5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2164458,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François-Xavier Roth","original_name":"François-Xavier Roth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608aacc343250f0040a976ce","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3072070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jeanneteau","original_name":"Daniel Jeanneteau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608aaccff8aee800578ca47d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A38Fi3T4h5VACIcpFjVq5yg9zow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
