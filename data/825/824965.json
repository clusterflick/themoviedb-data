This was made as a wedding gift to my then husband and outlines the giddiness and fright of flirtation and courtship (and the use of appropriated images). The use of the footage I chose reflects a romanticized view of courtship: a forced identification with a Hollywood-style ideal of relationship and space (namely, Paris) juxtaposed against my own Super-8 footage of Paris.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Intuition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Courtney Hoskins","original_name":"Courtney Hoskins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608dfb80c9dbf9002b18a12a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
