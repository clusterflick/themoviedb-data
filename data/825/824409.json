This majestic mountain range connects eight countries and reaches heights of up to 4,000 metres above sea level. At a length of 1,200 kilometres, the Alps form both a connecting bridge between western and eastern Europe and a high barrier between southern and central Europe. The mountains act as a mighty water reservoir and continental watershed, feeding innumerable rivers that flow into three different oceans.  Their highest peak, Mont Blanc, is surrounded by long, soaring mountains with ice-covered slopes. These great summits are just one reason the so-called “Roof of Europe” continues to fascinate – across the continent and around the world. The incredible diversity of landscapes, flora and fauna makes the Alps a unique natural treasure at the heart of Europe.","popularity":0.2786,"poster_path":"/ahdCbUTzmPqHqDsSCKVcBxbHUWq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10331,"logo_path":"/iyUmqBwQpsWOKw5uZ0j0DI5FN9t.png","name":"Terra Mater Factual
