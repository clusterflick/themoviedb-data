The \"Angel\" is a nice boy who is backing the show, and who is too modest to declare his love to Dottie. She can see no one save the great, handsome \"Strong Man.\" The knife thrower gets drunk, and the \"Angel\" forbids Dottie to do her act. The \"Strong Man,\" however, locks up the \"Angel\" and bids the knife thrower go on with the show. Dottie, terrified but helpless, has risked her life a half dozen times from the carelessly thrown knives, when the \"Angel,\" bursting out of his prison, rushes into the ring and flings himself between her and the weapons. He is seriously injured. At the hospital, Dottie and the \"Angel\" pledge their troth.","popularity":0.2082,"poster_path":"/tmSI68b2oh0Z9oad8tdcNNIIDis.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutual Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victorine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dottie","credit_id":"608d955c71ffdf0028bf6242","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1533333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Hinckley","original_name":"William Hinckley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Angel","credit_id":"608d956dc433ea002b0d8b3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Long","original_name":"Walter Long","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/oS2Ip4I7H5MQhKQcTNXVqMK62Im.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Strong Man","credit_id":"608d9579221ba6007c6a2c43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Lewis","original_name":"Ralph Lewis","popularity":0.2402,"profile_path":"/hcZEuTJlj57Eapbtp103IMq7DVP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Side Show Manager","credit_id":"608d95862588230040b49aca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Gaston","original_name":"Mae Gaston","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/7Ae0LRmBc0dM56eHP9UBlrcL4O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Tight Rope Walker","credit_id":"608d9594ac41610029b944de","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vester Pegg","original_name":"Vester Pegg","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"608d959dac41610056e4dcb0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie Lee","original_name":"Jennie Lee","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/8034W64tp7po3W3wijIXoOp0Fxg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"608d95a7f8aee80029062568","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Powell","original_name":"Paul Powell","popularity":0.132,"profile_path":"/tILXuOylWSeRZvMxbgpO8o1hbVR.jpg","credit_id":"608d95beac41610056e4dd0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604880,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julian Street","original_name":"Julian Street","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608d95c9c5840d0029344432","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006219","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1374,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tmSI68b2oh0Z9oad8tdcNNIIDis.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":916}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
