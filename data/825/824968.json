For about a year, Carl Fuermann and I would send each other individual digital images across the country, intending each one to serve as a single frame. Once received, each filmmaker would adjust the image and send it back to the other. The result was an organic chain of images. The final collection of images was recorded out onto 16mm film, thereby combining the digital with the physical.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polymer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Courtney Hoskins","original_name":"Courtney Hoskins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608dfbfcc433ea002b0e3b87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
