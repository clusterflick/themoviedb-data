I was motivated mostly by a longing for decent coffee. I wanted to become healthy after eating an unhealthy but fabulous tasting meal. I succeeded in walking over 100 blocks to Tims, taking the back roads, all on foot, with no Segways or bicycles used. Hourly, I put stretches of pot-holes behind me. I saw many beautiful landscapes, met friendly people, socialist workers, and here and there the occasional milksop whiner. I got along well with all of them, and had good conversations. I must say that people in this city are generally pretty strange.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hp2lHjHUh9kDcG75jBEmr9tZe4m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking from Sals to Tims","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clint Enns","original_name":"Clint Enns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608df7065ad76b0057d65188","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":957,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hp2lHjHUh9kDcG75jBEmr9tZe4m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
