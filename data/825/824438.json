I’d always been intrigued by the intricate natural and artificial shapes of the city’s Eastern harbour (eg the Woolloomooloo Finger Wharf and Pyrmont) and its ocean headlands and beaches. I cut out shapes from the Gregory’s Street Directory as mattes, and different filters to heighten and highlight Sydney’s extraordinary beauty. I used a hacksaw blade on the edge of a cymbal as a soundtrack...a kind of metallic sound to connect with the watery surfaces...I literally composed the film as it was running in the projector.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2vAmdKRCLPD4Zh6SrPq7EAoUb36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elevated Shores","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"608c311e5b4fed00795a5a7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2vAmdKRCLPD4Zh6SrPq7EAoUb36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
