Central to the programme is the story of Private Frank Meakin, who recorded his unique personal testimony of the war. Frank and his friends could never have anticipated what they would experience, but 100 years on we know in detail, thanks to his diary – an account that shouldn’t have existed, because keeping one was forbidden for servicemen on active duty on the Western Front. Frank’s diary, which was smuggled back from the Front, reveals the intimate details and dramatic stories of one battalion – and one British city – in the words of one man.","popularity":0.4715,"poster_path":"/cwFrgJhrijn3NI5b26zA2WXxLM4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Somme: The First 24 Hours with Tony Robinson","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Robinson","original_name":"Tony Robinson","popularity":0.4936,"profile_path":"/x8t38jqTwCSF1Gr5aBC9q1qPPKE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"608e01b0d8cc4a006e37af99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Ashland","original_name":"Simon Ashland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Private Frank Meakin","credit_id":"66b31150a2838813fb6f72b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Wharton","original_name":"Carl Wharton","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":"/f0mExT1X8aYtfagW7HeuV8fByxT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Captain William Folley","credit_id":"66b3116f4d3b5426dea1451b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Thirlwall","original_name":"Richard Thirlwall","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Private Alf Casey","credit_id":"66b3118176902f962cb51dd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Dawes","original_name":"Josef Dawes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Private Reg Glenn","credit_id":"66b311a201ef7218328867dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon M Coleman","original_name":"Jon M Coleman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sergeant Will Streets","credit_id":"66b311b264c968423ba11507","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Freeston","original_name":"Jeremy Freeston","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/1W5Rjwy7DHt1vmBMi7NlOuI7KGV.jpg","credit_id":"66b31206e6132e5f1d1d4929","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Freeston","original_name":"Jeremy Freeston","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/1W5Rjwy7DHt1vmBMi7NlOuI7KGV.jpg","credit_id":"66b31211b590f14165806480","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9zZmIlwaxsdo95YvwyjUe2EImo9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cwFrgJhrijn3NI5b26zA2WXxLM4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":15126,"name":"historical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
