Some of the houses shown have been standing for the last 100 to 150 years. The film honors the great craftsman of the past who utilized the \"dizeme\" technique through an emphasis on structures that are 300 years old. These examples are some of the most unique to be found in the Western Black Sea region. This craft has been passed down from generation to generation. Now only a few old and tired practitioners are left and they reveal to the camera their anti-earthquake construction techniques. The average age of the craftsmen is 80 years old.","popularity":0.0456,"poster_path":"/fmSbyLHT7UqDtstZa0M550eqftt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228026,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTV Film Televizyon","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1987-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of the Wood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2875826,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Süreyya Arın","original_name":"Süreyya Arın","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6635ad4ac3926601236e9f36","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Süha Arın","original_name":"Süha Arın","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608e22bbc9dbf9002b190687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4189535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serdar Temizkan","original_name":"Serdar Temizkan","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ac46fe6c180123303057","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692979,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Murat Deniz Sümer","original_name":"Murat Deniz Sümer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ac2cc9054f01308fa10d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadir Göktürk","original_name":"Nadir Göktürk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ae05470ead0122120674","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322742,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"İlhan Arakon","original_name":"İlhan Arakon","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/3CHgXcReVbkoT6vNHfgn63BT6Fb.jpg","credit_id":"6635abb8813cb601248818dd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692982,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Orhan Kaynar","original_name":"Orhan Kaynar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ac75e92d830121d303a6","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cahit Seymen","original_name":"Cahit Seymen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ac9b9590e30123bbe529","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692978,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Orhan Agaoglu","original_name":"Orhan Agaoglu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ac0a813cb60129881eb6","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bora Erbatur","original_name":"Bora Erbatur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635ad06a1c59d0129e7a601","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4008903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.
