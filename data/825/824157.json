The film uses physics, which explains how the universe works, to explain our metaphysics – the story of our values, our institutions, our interactions. Using her own experience and a custom blend of insight and humor, provocation and inspiration, personal story and social commentary, Emily takes her audience through its own paradigm shift: from the Fear of Change to the Edge of Chaos.","popularity":1.2733,"poster_path":"/9jq9ByNjkbGYEzzy49rktfcjXUW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emily @ the Edge of Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1233706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Levine","original_name":"Emily Levine","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60947876a1d33200408f890a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lithgow","original_name":"John Lithgow","popularity":2.2714,"profile_path":"/8Y1sjBdnVR483S8PrnAQzlESwhx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sir Isaac Newton (voice)","credit_id":"60947912c2b9df004172f435","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Tomlin","original_name":"Lily Tomlin","popularity":0.9626,"profile_path":"/eoFMSqRykiaXMGCiz7Kxehfqy1W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ayn Rand (voice)","credit_id":"6094792c21621b002ad9b22a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Nimoy","original_name":"Leonard Nimoy","popularity":1.3407,"profile_path":"/eKhw3oK8ak5LDB29X9zQDLIqRhw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sigmund Freud (voice)","credit_id":"6094793a209f180040e0bf7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lewis","original_name":"Richard Lewis","popularity":0.7208,"profile_path":"/xUiYIhzC0HfpkWn5QuaICLtE6Hy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Aristotle (voice)","credit_id":"6094794fc2b9df004172f4b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5741,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Matt Groening","original_name":"Matt Groening","popularity":0.5257,"profile_path":"/2HmAw3AN93DGESPi3ibLZgBa8cT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Aldo Leopold (voice)","credit_id":"60947960d207f3002a1c84cb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1117455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Apple","original_name":"Wendy Apple","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6094786390ea4b006f5a92c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1117455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Apple","original_name":"Wendy Apple","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6094785b2f1be0003fba8228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14539284","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1473,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9jq9ByNjkbGYEzzy49rktfcjXUW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
