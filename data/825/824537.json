As elusive as it is utterly gripping, the film juxtaposes and intersperses three scenes. A snail’s movements – tentative, curious – on a grooved mound of clay are contrasted against the powerful rhythms of a horserace shot at 240 frames per second; both of these are bookended by a shadowy display of a living, sculptural humanoid seemingly tormented by a web-like concoction of thread and nails fully enveloping its head, as a soundscape of terror and flickering embers unfolds.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x8AwMavu1K9tLxHZfDb4HigwB8L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orbital Squares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mujin Jung","original_name":"Mujin Jung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c7de671ffdf003f3b16f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hyoyoung Jung","original_name":"Hyoyoung Jung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c7df88c40f70057e9229f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youngdon Jung","original_name":"Youngdon Jung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c7e068c40f713e5145dc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x8AwMavu1K9tLxHZfDb4HigwB8L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy Film & Arts","release_date":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
