And there are always internal pressures as well. This program presents the accounts and stories of people who have recently taken the step of coming out. Interviewees and experts discuss the benefits of this important transition by examining the six stages of coming to terms with one’s sexual identity. They also look at the dangers of running away from sexual self-acceptance—such as alcoholism, drug abuse, and suicide—and how finding support can greatly assist the process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4Psx3nOgsui1DpA9wN6Mwm4KGkd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“This is the best short introduction to Gay and Lesbian history in the United States.”—Educational Media Reviews Online","title":"Being Gay: Coming Out in the 21st Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3075222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Mustanski PhD","original_name":"Brian Mustanski PhD","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"608d8c69c5840d002934332b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3075220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jarret Thompson MPH","original_name":"Jarret Thompson MPH","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608d8c049e4012002a4b7863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uoqcIkAnV9l8kgUUltrHgp48LFh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Psx3nOgsui1DpA9wN6Mwm4KGkd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9zA1LxuONuP4UXJDprG3DZm4Sf7.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":650},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4QzgPGluLdtHYitmLfEZI9MTICt.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
