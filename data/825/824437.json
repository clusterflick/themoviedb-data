History, place, time...and how we feel compelled to endlessly photograph one another. We’re all in a way little ham actors...a wave, a smile, doing a little dance...performing for the camera in front of landscapes and monuments. I worked with some old 16mm home-movie footage I’d been given, shot in the Blue Mountains [a favourite tourist destination and wilderness area close to Sydney]. Through optical printing and camerawork in the field I managed to combine the feel of then and now. [...] I used a prism in front of the lens, which chased the images (including some of me, photographing) ‘round and ‘round...mirroring the way history endlessly repeats itself.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rCjX2qgXngpthJx1lgpbj5afPAM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Winkler","original_name":"Paul Winkler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/l9Z46PsCsfZWoehytV3iji3ccGD.jpg","credit_id":"608c322e5b4fed005979baf0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCjX2qgXngpthJx1lgpbj5afPAM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dxetz5KGTd4wTF26rLsGuQoCLL9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
