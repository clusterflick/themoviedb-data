Utilizing the open source creative coding library p5.js, the outermost channels of video run through handmade javascript expressions modeling a spirograph and Brownian motion, respectively. The movement of the three video channels interact as interlaced found footage blends natural symbology with rote pattern, algorithmic generation, and most importantly, the visualization of both nature and technologyâ€™s operational mechanisms. These representations are themselves inevitably crude and ineffectual, yet the border at which human knowledge attempts to integrate the natural or the techno-natural into its empirical organization is the onus of potential change. In time, the competing images crescendo into a virtual reality landscape, deeply artificial yet singular in its affective potential: a parallel nature, a transhumanist Eden.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/xv60YBEQ6tyLIpmGAvbAh6Tvh2H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"life/like","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2618001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrey Robinovitz","original_name":"Audrey Robinovitz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"voice","credit_id":"608c4b4971ffdf0077754b20","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2618001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrey Robinovitz","original_name":"Audrey Robinovitz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608c4b5607e281005930212a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1084,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xv60YBEQ6tyLIpmGAvbAh6Tvh2H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":722}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
