The film tells the history of the park with a greater focus on the Rides department. In it, you can see employee meetings before the park began operating, moments of relaxation, lunch, among many other remarkable things that only employees had access to. And even never-before-seen footage of the dismantling of Boomerang; the first major attraction to leave the park.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yQ4IkpvBgcHSoPnYL9prkreT2tH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Família Rides","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playcenter DOC","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edelson Silva","original_name":"Edelson Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"682a14e4b1b47c49e85b5637","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidnei Fideles","original_name":"Sidnei Fideles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"682a14f5eaeb5360bcdb273a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446981,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Janderson Rosa","original_name":"Janderson Rosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"682a1523c78f4532bf2f70a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446982,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allan Santos","original_name":"Allan Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"682a158784c17c112f8c03a9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Santos","original_name":"Allan Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a13661a38ecabcb2f7025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446977,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Leme","original_name":"Richard Leme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a13948a8e3de9759e31a9","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446978,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edson Jesus","original_name":"Edson Jesus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a13a103dc7f4ef2db28da","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446979,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Danilo","original_name":"Patrick Danilo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a13ac35d9a5741b5b5599","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446980,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tânia Gomes","original_name":"Tânia Gomes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a13d4eaeb5360bcdb2725","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446981,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Janderson Rosa","original_name":"Janderson Rosa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a13e3b1b47c49e85b562c","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446982,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allan Santos","original_name":"Allan Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a146e437fadcc6f648bb6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5446977,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Leme","original_name":"Richard Leme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a14781939824f11db28a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mWvoREirKN6JRygMl0BUlnCaxM8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQ4IkpvBgcHSoPnYL9prkreT2tH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158340,"name":"theme park"},{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Playcenter DOC. - Erros de Gravação!","key":"ViDhrYLnwiM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Bloopers","official":false,"published_at":"2012-09-18T00:50:24.000Z","id":"682a15a912d9a0515e2f70df"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Playcenter DOC. - Trailer Oficial (HD)","key":"8--ngZu564M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-08-21T14:40:25.000Z","id":"682a15a0f7e538f8302f718e"}]}}}
