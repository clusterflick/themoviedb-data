Under the shadow of Dr. Josef Mengele’s horrific experiments, Spiegel used his courage, compassion, and ingenuity to shield the most vulnerable—the sets of twins targeted for brutal medical experimentation. Mengele put Spiegel in charge of the young boys, but Spiegel used his position to protect and comfort the children, all of whom had been torn from their families and subjected to inhumane tests under the constant threat of extermination.  Through first-hand testimony and exclusive archival material, The Last Twins brings to life the voices of those who survived because of Spiegel’s defiance. It is a testament to resilience, sacrifice, and the power of one person to make a difference, even in humanity’s darkest hour.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/b0hj9CaMoJJAR5efDyPBkPEIwpN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zuli Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"One man.
