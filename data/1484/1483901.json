One of America`s most poetic and powerful painters, Gorky`s influence on his contemporaries gave birth to the New York School of abstract expressionist painting.  In rare glimpses into his studio and through interviews with family and friends, this film recreates Gorky`s world, examines the progression of his painting to the later, deeply felt work, that suggests the beauty and anguish of his lost Armenian homeland.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strokes
