In a world ravaged  by hunger, survival has become a mere struggle. Bhookh  delves into the insatiable desires that drive a brutal,  class-divided society. The film follows a desperate poor  father who faces the unthinkable: with no food, no work, and  no hope, he must sell his young son to a company where human  life is commodified. Bhookh explores the destructive nature  of unchecked greed and the relentless cycle of exploitation.  It depicts the head of multinational company that works for  Human Resources services, raising questions about the  authenticity of their claims and whether they are merely a  cover for their dark appetites: consuming the very they  claim to govern.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/60MCSiCYGeRwOryMcDgQPWfgSul.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE, EVEN YOU","title":"BHOOKH","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gokul Bharti","original_name":"Gokul Bharti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vikram Mehra (Boss)","credit_id":"682b6062eeec5423d90bd8f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amit Chandra","original_name":"Amit Chandra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Servant","credit_id":"682b60791245855917db2e81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hemanshu Tariang","original_name":"Hemanshu Tariang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Son","credit_id":"682b609f3850f0eb315b5ccf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ansh Khan","original_name":"Ansh Khan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Victim","credit_id":"682b60bb989cf65c7edb2d19","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siddhesh Saxena","original_name":"Siddhesh Saxena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Father","credit_id":"682b60da9ca17c9182649128","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","original_name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b61077c9d2798e9db2e42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hardik Soni","original_name":"Hardik Soni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b61221245855917db2e8c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annya","original_name":"Annya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b6142cc923137c06490e1","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","original_name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b61a9d06d53d1b39e3544","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","original_name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b61c29c392c1e61f55eb4","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annya","original_name":"Annya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b61d6d5e676ea920bdb45","department":"Art","job":"Property Master"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5448785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","original_name":"Harshvardhan Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b61ee5af708fe099e399d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/60MCSiCYGeRwOryMcDgQPWfgSul.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
