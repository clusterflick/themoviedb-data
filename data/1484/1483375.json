First, St. Clare of Assisi reveals the extraordinary life of St. Clare, a woman who reached the highest summits of Christian mysticism, who knew how to defend her decisions alone and who built a social reality that still challenges the centuries. Along with medieval harmonies composed by Oscar-winning musicians, the exquisite photography explores all of the sacred places in and around Assisi that characterize the life of Clare and that of Francis. The testimony of a Poor Clare in the 40-minute documentary, moreover, exemplifies the figure of Clare in today's world. The second program, included as a bonus, is Poor Clares: A Hidden Presence. More than twenty thousand women today follow the example of Clare of Assisi in monasteries scattered throughout the world - the cloistered convent, a city in prayer and a hidden presence with a love with reserve for all of humanity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qIaabO6Cp67ChWgDIwY4c8LHCF9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love without reserve for all the world","title":"St Clare of Assisi and Poor Clares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5447210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kingsley McLaren","original_name":"Kingsley McLaren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"682a4193050c90eded64898f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5447209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Sbicca","original_name":"Arturo Sbicca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a4176adf57ca709f559ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qIaabO6Cp67ChWgDIwY4c8LHCF9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
