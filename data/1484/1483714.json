Envisioning an exploration of the nature of listening (of apprehending or not, remembering or not, and creating meaning) and of the repetitions & variations of verbal expression and its accompanying often-emphatic physical gesturing as a basis for making visual music, I, as filmmaker turned \"media artist\", employ the full range of temporal manipulation available within my concurrent digital set-up, exploiting unique corners which differentiate DV from 16mm, though including frequent references to themes & techniques from Jacobs' own work within the arcanum of film. The \"musical score\" is derived through permutations of the sync track. This was the first released section from the ongoing series, premiering March 2004 at the Museum of Modern Art.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/sTJ8VlG7y1J2gm6vSyaQZmRQzPH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nervous Ken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.8789,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"682af89e9d0789dfb08c05fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flo Jacobs","original_name":"Flo Jacobs","popularity":0.321,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"682af8b363fc3c228a2f7339","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henry Hills","original_name":"Henry Hills","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682af88a005c09508a8c076c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sTJ8VlG7y1J2gm6vSyaQZmRQzPH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
