Editing cuts swallow up her world, bringing to the surface an archipelago of cinematic universes (from L’avventura to Stromboli and La terra trema), and they generate a fata morgana, capable of shortening distances  between pampas and Mediterranean landscapes, between real and fictional vision, between the adult’s disorientation and the childhood’s innate and hilarious wisdom.  Cinema as the art of disappearance that always leaves a trace, yet another indelible trace of one of the most important contemporary filmmakers.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/oG3923ZU90jlF9s7XFOnuvU7gcn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2025-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A dream made in Sicily, where every glimpse is cinema.","title":"Laura Citarella for Sicilia Queer 2025","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1687643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ezequiel Pierri","original_name":"Ezequiel Pierri","popularity":0.2771,"profile_path":"/f48Qu8ldgGBUruGVdprXWNx8auv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ezequiel","credit_id":"682a1a2889abd112419e34cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5447014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucía Pierri Citarella","original_name":"Lucía Pierri Citarella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"682a1d547d5cfbe96b0bd49d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1266005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Citarella","original_name":"Laura Citarella","popularity":0.5003,"profile_path":"/zby9FNc91M0od2oUUDzhBSMlpgu.jpg","credit_id":"682a1aaf15a01d5a44e2498f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1266005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Citarella","original_name":"Laura Citarella","popularity":0.5003,"profile_path":"/zby9FNc91M0od2oUUDzhBSMlpgu.jpg","credit_id":"682a1ad4d5b21f6368648a76","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073661,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fernando Brom","original_name":"Fernando Brom","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a1aeea788f78d886489bd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390025,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ignacio Codino","original_name":"Ignacio Codino","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a1b0bd38bca193d5b557d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285603,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcos Canosa","original_name":"Marcos Canosa","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a1b265d142a60730bd4b9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1980756,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Inés Duacastella","original_name":"Inés Duacastella","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/zosMUSgdSDZRAnZDDsffoW6QM5p.jpg","credit_id":"682a1bf4a9abf722132f7043","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLSS65ZXbcklcm5ShdmMbOolgJZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1368,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oG3923ZU90jlF9s7XFOnuvU7gcn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":977}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ATP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
