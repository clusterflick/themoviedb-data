In a continuous and hallucinatory flow, extreme grotesque and baroque pornography, mysticism, art, and desire merge into a single sensory and symbolic experience.  Accompanied by the music of S. Lummi and M. Capitanio, the film takes the form of a contemporary infernal circle, where the viewer is dragged through images that reflect human obsessions, deviations, and ecstasies. A visionary and unsettling journey, where each fragment represents a piece of the eternal tension between the sublime and the perverse.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sublime e Perverso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5136918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Zanuso","original_name":"Luigi Zanuso","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/25cuDSF7P9gY6jQnWAHMgD5PKRn.jpg","credit_id":"682a37353850f0eb315b57b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5447178,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stefano Lummi","original_name":"Stefano Lummi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a3ba064ff813d3b9e3144","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5447179,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marco Capitanio","original_name":"Marco Capitanio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a3bb8d9192568c18c065f","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5136918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Zanuso","original_name":"Luigi Zanuso","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/25cuDSF7P9gY6jQnWAHMgD5PKRn.jpg","credit_id":"682a4954fc4fc9c6fd5b5867","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5136918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Zanuso","original_name":"Luigi Zanuso","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/25cuDSF7P9gY6jQnWAHMgD5PKRn.jpg","credit_id":"682a496835d9a5741b5b56fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5136918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Zanuso","original_name":"Luigi Zanuso","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/25cuDSF7P9gY6jQnWAHMgD5PKRn.jpg","credit_id":"682a497600d1cec6c1db2898","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
