It is also the first time that Arnont exhibits with guest collaborator Khvay Loeung, a sound inventor from Phnom Penh. The exhibition presents sound and moving-image works by Arnont and Loeung exploring an approach to communications and the concept of life passing-on through sonic and visual mediations. With the language barrier between the two artists, the presented work is not only a result of their collaboration but in fact also the method of their collaboration. They attempt to achieve a mutual understanding through a sonic experimentation or rather another sound language. The exhibition also presents site-specific work intervening Sa Sa Art Projects space, turning the information of the space’s surface into a sonic vibration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Another Sound","title":"Another Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnont Nongyao","original_name":"Arnont Nongyao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"682ab07d4b404174342f738b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5447793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khvay Loeung","original_name":"Khvay Loeung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"682ab0d4846aa0a86cdb294b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnont Nongyao","original_name":"Arnont Nongyao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682ab18f63fc3c228a2f7230","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
