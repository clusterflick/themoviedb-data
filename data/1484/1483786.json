Using this concept as a springboard, Enstrom and Warren have set out to make five short pieces that explore beauty, darkness and transcendence during this metaphoric time of bardo, when our normal way of life has become suspended.  All sound was made utilizing Enstrom’s violins, voice, and samples and was produced and recorded by her in her home studio. All visuals were made with Warren’s 16mm Bolex and Canon super 8 film cameras.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8kpZfm9fWB7DASjXDRrju9PDIWt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bardo Becoming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Warren","original_name":"John Warren","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b1470f0c5ed6dbd9e35ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8kpZfm9fWB7DASjXDRrju9PDIWt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
