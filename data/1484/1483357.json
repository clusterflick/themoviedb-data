Through intimate interviews and poetic visual language, the film traces the emotional landscape of fear, resistance, and celebration within trans lives. Rather than focusing solely on trauma, it highlights resilience, affirming that the desire to live fully — the pulsão de vida — is itself a radical act of care and defiance. In this sensitive yet urgent portrait, trans bodies become sites of struggle and survival, where health is not merely medical but deeply political and collective.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fIDGWgLX6CdyMkW1rm3Dyxm0FEg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Fight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5447160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beni Campos","original_name":"Beni Campos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682a360c69ebea95582f71a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/fIDGWgLX6CdyMkW1rm3Dyxm0FEg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
