Alongside medical care, he gave children crayons and paper, encouraging them to draw their experiences. The resulting images—bombings, shootings, and burning villages—offer a raw, heartbreaking glimpse into the impact of war on children. These drawings serve as powerful testimonies, capturing trauma that words cannot. This short film tells Dr. Jerry’s story and honors the children whose art bears witness to the horrors of conflict.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3ogKlO0qttRDpGSFWrDzGjEqDEf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bell, Book and Camera Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Years of war and Genocide.
