It’s 1975. A smart, ambitious woman (The Wife) is stuck in the kitchen. When feisty, martini-drinking Betty steps out of a 1950s cookbook, The Wife is confronted with what she really wants out of life (it's not to make another meatloaf). Faced with Betty’s tough love and in a desperate effort to find one goddamn minute for herself, The Wife takes matters into her own hands, with gleefully horrific results.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/uuDDJ4fFCyKeelkCWGpirPRsgvB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Same
