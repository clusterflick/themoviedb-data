A small electrical current is constantly moving through the nerves, muscles, and tissues of our body. It can be seen and heard with an electromyograph. By hearing it, a patient can re-learn certain physical functions that have been lost. In other instances, hearing this current can help doctors to determine the nature of a nerve disease otherwise undefinable. The spinal stimulation consists of softly activating the surrounding area of the nerve in question as to incite it to draw energy from it's own potential. In spite of its scientific background, \"Currents\" is my personal account of this enlightening experience.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Currents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2083637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrej Zdravič","original_name":"Andrej Zdravič","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682b4bcc9ca17c9182649057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
