Through analysis of social movements and popular culture, the film attempts to dismantle the idea that a pact among the Spanish ruling elite, led by Adolfo Suárez and King Juan Carlos, \"saved\" Spain from a new civil war and paved the way for a \"peaceful\" transition to a democratic regime.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/r5k0NXkp8RnuSEK28CeuibuKOZr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plan Rosebud 2: Calling the Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075147,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"María Ruido","original_name":"María Ruido","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692e233427802ce29c64acde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075147,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"María Ruido","original_name":"María Ruido","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692e233e72dab43940398f43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iJKCnQoQL3auKY27oZrZSpKXIJ2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5k0NXkp8RnuSEK28CeuibuKOZr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
