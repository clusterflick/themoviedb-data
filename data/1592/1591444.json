DeWitt, there to purchase drugs, is so moved by Mike's pugnacity, that he takes her to his mansion for literary inspiration. When DeWitt learns that Mike is a girl, he resolves to educate her. As Mike blossoms, DeWitt's attentions turn to love, to the dismay of Judith Winthrope, who wants to marry him, and his friend Robert Breton, who, with Judith, convinces Mike that DeWitt's writing is suffering because of her.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rK64JM2d3SATF5nGyZBZQySKbDk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Microbe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Le microbe","type":"French Canadian title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Happy O'Brien, The Microbe","credit_id":"692ebc4673ac51019264afb4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Harlan","original_name":"Kenneth Harlan","popularity":0.2888,"profile_path":"/nIiGHwnOGFrZW2pui9rUKRFPs5p.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"DeWitt Spense","credit_id":"692ebc56fd7f09f4205127a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Maude","original_name":"Arthur Maude","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Robert Breton","credit_id":"692ebc689ec68c924c6e2e52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Hill","original_name":"Bonnie Hill","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/m5bBQxEdv3YaUQ7bnxE4M6hmIXB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Judith Winthrope","credit_id":"692ebc7f154b9a8eea5127d5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5851610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Norworth","original_name":"Ned Norworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Norman Slade","credit_id":"692ebca6dc9e1115193ea81f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Donahue","original_name":"Lucy Donahue","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Risden","credit_id":"692ebcb81fc69e2fd25126ba","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Otto","original_name":"Henry Otto","popularity":0.2242,"profile_path":"/3K5x9toiUwcAtz8LdzziFfG74sR.jpg","credit_id":"692ebccf9a321c52e8dc37cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140847,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry Altimus","original_name":"Henry Altimus","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ebcdef4a929b428dc3667","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"June Mathis","original_name":"June Mathis","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/kiwwEYmnN6r3kEitWWah8iH8oGW.jpg","credit_id":"692ebcf6dbf1570e026e2e46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxwell Karger","original_name":"Maxwell Karger","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ebd06b368f1dfa6114625","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29970,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Arnold","original_name":"John Arnold","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ebd1cdbf1570e026e2e49","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1420,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rK64JM2d3SATF5nGyZBZQySKbDk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":947}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1919-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
