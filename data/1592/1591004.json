As the inquiry unfolds in present day through separate interrogations, the two former detectives narrate the story of their investigation, reopening unhealed wounds, and drawing into question their supposed solving of a bizarre ritualistic murder in 1995. The timelines braid and converge in 2012 as each man is pulled back into a world they believed they'd left behind. In learning about each other and their killer, it becomes clear that darkness lives on both sides of the law.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/cOn2hOvu6AgS1lPES9yTDiyaFWS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10039,"logo_path":"/b8w4LldQolMKiLZw4FQJBcXSDGI.png","name":"Anonymous
