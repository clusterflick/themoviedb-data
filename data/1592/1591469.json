In a series of short pieces choreographed and performed specifically for video space, Cunningham is multiplied, overlaid and transported from the studio to a series of unexpected landscapes. Cunningham's gestural dance is manipulated to the accompaniment of a disjunctive audio collage that includes the voices of John Cage and Jasper Johns.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zMQJCPkw9wEFAPASMwnVwxij52h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merce by Merce by Paik Part One: Blue Studio: Five Segments 1975-1976","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Atlas","original_name":"Charles Atlas","popularity":1.4213,"profile_path":"/dlYNDRuv0iInZxbFxvVTC7UUsbv.jpg","credit_id":"692ec513874110483864af59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merce Cunningham","original_name":"Merce Cunningham","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ec54a6ccb22453d6e2eba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zMQJCPkw9wEFAPASMwnVwxij52h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
