Antonio Vivaldi's Argippo was originally composed for a Prague debut in 1730. Lost for centuries, the opera's score was discovered by the young Czech conductor Ondřej Macek. Almost as remarkable as the discovery of this lost masterpiece was the process of recreating the work. Dan Krames' film observes, gloriously, the gradual birth of the modern-day world premiere of Argippo and the search for an authentic Baroque interpretation of it. It confirms the genius of Argippo, the most significant opera \"written for Prague\" before Mozart's Don Giovanni.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":281963,"logo_path":null,"name":"ALPHA PLUS Pro, s.r.o.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2009-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Argippo Resurrected","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Argippo Resurrected","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Argippo Revisited","type":"Online"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ondřej Macek","original_name":"Ondřej Macek","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"self","credit_id":"692e0411c63812c043398e81","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5850330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronika Mráčková Fučíková","original_name":"Veronika Mráčková Fučíková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Argippo / self","credit_id":"692e0430142fb077a7e33bf2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Krameš","original_name":"Dan Krameš","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692dff88dc6f204c4f1142bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Krameš","original_name":"Dan Krameš","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692dffa4c042ce8df551222a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Krameš","original_name":"Dan Krameš","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692dffbde11a4a60ad1141d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4553654,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Natálie Nádassy","original_name":"Natálie Nádassy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692dffdd75ecd5925f26ef76","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5850314,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nat Schemark","original_name":"Nat Schemark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692e002304bf856d62398eda","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Krameš","original_name":"Dan Krameš","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692e00367cb16651d7286866","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Krameš","original_name":"Dan Krameš","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692e004af4a929b428dc32f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Vivaldi","original_name":"Antonio Vivaldi","popularity":0.1361,"profile_path":"/mDgLWGnbOlnBd1uSsfvoZMU0aI9.jpg","credit_id":"692e00710ffd03350ddc32f2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2330439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Krameš","original_name":"Dan Krameš","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692e00a415d19e44cc26f02a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1520266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"The 28th Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
