It is not uncommon for 70 percent of the students at schools there to be foreigners, as is the case at the school where the children portrayed in the film are experiencing their first year of school: the filmmakers accompanied five children from different families and with different cultural backgrounds over a period of several years. The clash of different cultures shapes the children's everyday lives, but proves to be less problematic than the typical difficulties all children face: conflicts with their parents and finding their place among their schoolmates. The documentary takes the children's perspective and provides exciting insights into their everyday lives, feelings, and dreams.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":282024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kern TV","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Kinder von St. Georg - Erste Schuljahre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Franke","original_name":"Leslie Franke","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ec53043fa97a11d26f1c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herdolor Lorenz","original_name":"Herdolor Lorenz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ec5b8dcdde0e284286c74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
