Featuring interviews with almost 30 contributors — including all four Pevensie actors — the film revisits key filming locations, explores childhood memories from the set, and reveals how the beloved series was created with ingenuity despite limited resources. Cast and crew reflect on the challenges of bringing C.S. Lewis’s world to life, the production decisions that shaped the adaptations, and the lasting impact the series has had on fans and on their own lives. Blending behind-the-scenes stories, archival material, and warm reunion moments, Return to Narnia celebrates the enduring legacy of the BBC’s Narnia and the timeless magic that continues to draw audiences back through the wardrobe.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unknown","title":"Return to Narnia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dempsey","original_name":"Richard Dempsey","popularity":0.6765,"profile_path":"/gaUPWEBm4qMlqXstzRgu9s3OGMT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"692e021e58cf429f8764ada0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marc Perret","original_name":"Jean-Marc Perret","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"692e023c57fd0ccff626ef24","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Wilcox","original_name":"Sophie Wilcox","popularity":0.8338,"profile_path":"/1JJiZpHWph6OF1GkNUhY5CIj7BO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"692e0256e9e4974d02e33c43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan R.
