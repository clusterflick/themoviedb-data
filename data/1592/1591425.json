Unlike many women's films, it is not a documentary or narrative directed at women's issues. Rather, it might be considered a comedy for the women's movement. It is a feminist film not because of any political message but because of the liberation implicits in its imagery. There is a musical soundtrack but no dialogue; the images come fast and surreal, jarring images from a mythic kingdom, where hugely pregnant women rock on and babies fall flat on their face. A really joyus celebration of women, life and film. \" -Camille Cook, Chicago Art Institute","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women & Children at Large","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2477629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Freude","original_name":"Freude","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692eb4e472dab439403991c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, CA","release_date":"1972-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
