Historians, rabbis and congregants take us through time, from the Congregation's Spanish Inquisition roots, through its American Reform present to its uncertain future. The film gives us an intimate look at Jewish life, shedding light on its traditions, rituals and mysteries.  And in the process, it pries at the cracks dividing the Jewish world today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gjI93BedHncH4LQ0jgYZwtCmyHs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands","origin_country":""},{"id":281992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Rock Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VI","name":"US Virgin Islands"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A thousand-year journey back home.
