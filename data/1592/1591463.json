Zora feels such great longing for the French artist Adrien that she accepts the offer of another artist, Raoul, to take her to Paris with the stipulation that if Adrien rejects her, she must give herself to him. Jan, the chieftain's son who is in love with Zora, follows the two to Paris. There Zora realizes that Adrien does not love her and discovers her real love for Jan. However, she feels bound to honor her pact with Raoul and is about to succumb to his advances when her father appears and recognizes Raoul as the man who destroyed his home years earlier. In the ensuing fight between the two men, Raoul is killed, thus freeing Zora to accept Jan's love.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/p8FHYlWmXDUpiJAcEJ1H5Bs1KJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":282023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haworth Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moon Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Storey","original_name":"Edith Storey","popularity":0.7699,"profile_path":"/r8iO5KZFDf3V7o13KWlB67iuWZK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Valerie / Zora","credit_id":"692f85ee236ca57bf98cdc5c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam De Grasse","original_name":"Sam De Grasse","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/qiMJezjBhoygL6UDnGxF1wfqBm1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Adrien","credit_id":"692f85ff10a4811dd1635907","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Swickard","original_name":"Josef Swickard","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/fvkxWMqUjAmbHrBD1a0J2U4PIMO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Latour","credit_id":"692f860f7f5a7501f1ccb0bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace MacDonald","original_name":"Wallace MacDonald","popularity":0.6851,"profile_path":"/lP3Lxz5EiWYhziMJedbkuzeaQeE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jan","credit_id":"692f862b6fdbc1f0d076da70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1313479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Hunt","original_name":"Irene Hunt","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/6pbirQNwrOER5hVlkWRsnfVULzj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Badoura","credit_id":"692f86439bbd8da88676da8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1779120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Courtleigh","original_name":"William Courtleigh","popularity":0.1377,"profile_path":"/wacovCBvLrCxXaHOu18IO5LQ4E2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Raoul","credit_id":"692f86569bbd8da88676da8f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Lee","original_name":"Frankie Lee","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/cGqqasAH7DB29Zphl1SVv76kBcF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"692f866809a7b589e0c95df1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Starr","original_name":"Fred Starr","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Arab Chief","credit_id":"692f867cea8654db47c95de4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Campbell","original_name":"Colin Campbell","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/dGmWZLBzh1sQSTNDgRU1itpeYu5.jpg","credit_id":"692f868fd76e14618a3bc2c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.
