The narrative explores the relationship between two very different characters, drawing a comparison between them and two animals: the Elephant and the Bird. Each animal represents one of the human figures, and they attempt to become similar to each other in order to be together.  Gradually, they come to realize that simply accepting their differences is preferable and healthier, ultimately allowing them to grow and move forward together.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/raxmnkjVQkWmX4Cl5HmGl86gWR9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short story about a relationship between two very distinct animals, shown through experimental language.","title":"Nenufares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5100768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Lima","original_name":"Maria Lima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kP2EP0Es5Es6acfx9AXCpsRe6Zo.jpg","credit_id":"692dd4f8f3cb46ee893ea3ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5100768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Lima","original_name":"Maria Lima","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kP2EP0Es5Es6acfx9AXCpsRe6Zo.jpg","credit_id":"692dd9c099d2e6fd773ea3e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":934,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oLtP2Sq57mu735ieE66oErASqBM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1660}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/raxmnkjVQkWmX4Cl5HmGl86gWR9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/3","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
