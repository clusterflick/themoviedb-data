The closing ceremonies of the \"friendly games\" feature the athletes gathering to — as the official song's chorus put it — \"join together\". Four directors joined together to work on it: Arthur Everard, John King, Paul Maunder and Sam Pillsbury.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/e7PGatjRwW3sulGC70BImoUf8iM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198170,"logo_path":null,"name":"The National Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Games '74: Official Film of the Xth British Commonwealth Games, Christchurch, New Zealand, 1974","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Everard","original_name":"Arthur Everard","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4b2ed04b24a85464b272","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John King","original_name":"John King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4b9327802ce29c64b1b5","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Pillsbury","original_name":"Sam Pillsbury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4bcadc6f204c4f11484e","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Maunder","original_name":"Paul Maunder","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4c0472dab439403994b0","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852670,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beth Butler","original_name":"Beth Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4dd1472a6daa7826f46a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852677,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stanley Harper","original_name":"Stanley Harper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4e0e1b89c6478fdc3acb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Maunder","original_name":"Paul Maunder","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f4e2edc9e1115193eaab6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5619024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1390,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e7PGatjRwW3sulGC70BImoUf8iM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
