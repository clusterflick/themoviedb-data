They cut all contact with the outside world, entering an isolation they still haven't abandoned. German filmmaker/biologist, Carl Gierstorfer, turns around in front of the forest, looking back at those who want to contact the isolated Mashco Piro: missionaries, gold miners, drug traffickers, ordinary villagers. Only a group of dedicated anthropologists stands between outside forces and the Mashco Piro, themselves torn between curiosity and fear. When a murder happens, Gierstorfer is there to document the story.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z1wqS41GRvlzKXONrALSDesddtH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The River Between Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les frères de l'autre rive - Le combat pour les Mashco Piro","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Fluss, der uns trennt: Perus Kampf um ein unkontaktiertes Volk","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Gierstorfer","original_name":"Carl Gierstorfer","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/ccO1BjojOwzKqoj2BZ3Ai3j7osW.jpg","credit_id":"692ee6fc4dfecf257426f3d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5851840,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Klinck","original_name":"Elizabeth Klinck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692ee72222e7c67ab2286c0c","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcel Ozan Riedel","original_name":"Marcel Ozan Riedel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f004043fa97a11d26f30a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcel Ozan Riedel","original_name":"Marcel Ozan Riedel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f00470988ca30d15125a5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Slater","original_name":"Sam Slater","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f005bf200cf40d426f387","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121442,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmel Fuhg","original_name":"Carmel Fuhg","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f0094d962c76f15286be3","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799553,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cynthia Kane","original_name":"Cynthia Kane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f00a3491b868cf13991cf","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Gierstorfer","original_name":"Carl Gierstorfer","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/ccO1BjojOwzKqoj2BZ3Ai3j7osW.jpg","credit_id":"692f00abdad0914600399213","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Gierstorfer","original_name":"Carl Gierstorfer","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/ccO1BjojOwzKqoj2BZ3Ai3j7osW.jpg","credit_id":"692f00b3ae12302245399329","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2511409,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Reichert","original_name":"Michael Reichert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f00c3a1fd785d2b286bbc","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852071,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Morales Avendaño","original_name":"Jorge Morales Avendaño","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f00cc43fa97a11d26f321","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2121442,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmel Fuhg","original_name":"Carmel Fuhg","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f00da22e7c67ab2286cd4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5852073,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ruth Mier y Terán","original_name":"Ruth Mier y Terán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692f00e5fb266fec83286bea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19848842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z1wqS41GRvlzKXONrALSDesddtH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
