In what would become true Sherlockian fashion, he had the ability to deduce facts about his patients from otherwise unremarkable details.\r Based on extensive research into the life of Bell and including tantalizing accounts of the connections between Bell and Conan Doyle, this biography is for anyone interested in Victorian medicine, in the history of detective fiction, and in Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/kam8M0QL3xFNdcyq8K7X0Mnxa8I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinenova","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sherlock Holmes: The True Story","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3384815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Kenner","original_name":"Roy Kenner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66c987ba9d6e507ac51d4279","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Sheehan","original_name":"Michael Sheehan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c98769cee866a9488f29d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Rowley","original_name":"Christopher Rowley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c9871224b6befdf0a70293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7319146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XSIUFBEia6EuJtpH3EDb5oChvX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kam8M0QL3xFNdcyq8K7X0Mnxa8I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Discovery Channel","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
