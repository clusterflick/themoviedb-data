With unprecedented access to one of the UK's largest landfill sites, the team of experts spend three days carrying out tests all over the site, revealing the secret world of rubbish. They also carry out three other 'archaeological' digs into historic landfills to chart the evolution of our throwaway society. Ultimately, their quest is to discover whether the items we throw away today have any value for tomorrow's world.","popularity":0.0565,"poster_path":"/xwUQBRkOyeKUggB5rtbBRNnY7C3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Life of Landfill: A Rubbish History","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140868,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harry Bell","original_name":"Harry Bell","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb4feeac3a36860c80015ee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Collinson","original_name":"Craig Collinson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb4feb8c3a36860c6000ebe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Collinson","original_name":"Craig Collinson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb4fe9cc3a36860d00017df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8890540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qbPh60yrcgv8yWMNqi7Bh5W45fQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xwUQBRkOyeKUggB5rtbBRNnY7C3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8fFxNwifjAx3BqKi4xcmtlius4N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
