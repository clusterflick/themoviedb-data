A man confused as the God of Fire in prehistory; Jesus and Muhammad deciding who must eat what and when because of a power no one has seen; Tiberius Gracchus killed by the senate because he was fighting for the people. Tretti had a bullet for everyone. He loved to unmask those who claimed to be on the side of the less fortunate, showing the three powers - military, commercial and agricultural - sitting on three thrones and chatting on how they can suck life out of men and keep power tight in their hands.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/z9CtowlBdZkhtxbM5PDl0TZEPNm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aquarius
