In an empty room she dances out the movement of the machines and taps out their sound with her feet. As the video continues it becomes clear that in fact that she has greater ambitions for these non-existent objects and that she believes she is presenting a proposal for a pavilion. The work is an investigation into gendered ambition and presence; it attempts to present the complications of choosing to use the body, language or objects as the method by which we move thought into the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 (buh buh buh) proposal for a collating machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Clout","original_name":"Lucy Clout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb4c7d4925141780b012d33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
