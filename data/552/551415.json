In the south are large pockets of untouched wilderness where extraordinary animals flourish and Koreans continue to practice age-old traditions in tandem with the seasons and with nature. It is in these connections, rather than in division, that we see the true Korea.","popularity":0.0974,"poster_path":"/9aE1QPOzoPZv7X9H429FDjksHKt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buzz Media","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"South Korea: Earth's Hidden Wilderness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Hidden Nature of Korea","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Lee","original_name":"Arthur Lee","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/j0fNPc6TBSfHeoBjjOQn6twsR3S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"636113561b72940094899e56","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8006664","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i61hdEikmFY8tB1a62KFG8vsy2j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9aE1QPOzoPZv7X9H429FDjksHKt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":692}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
