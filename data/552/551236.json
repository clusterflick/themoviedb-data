They issued him ten visas in fifteen years. A long trail of papers, stamps, permits, and restrictions connected Darío to Germany while also keeping him at a distance. Then one fine day the mayor of Hamburg invites Darío to become a German citizen. A confession of love? Darío responds with a tender, ironic road movie that traces his intertwined journey from the country of his fathers to the country of his children.","popularity":0.1153,"poster_path":"/bHCN6W9CGMZprG6MofbQEP3oRhx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Büchner Filmproduktion
