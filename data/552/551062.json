The documentary stresses that alcoholism is a disease which must be treated medically and socially. Instead of turning a blind eye to others' problems, it is important to realize that people of all ages, genders, and social backgrounds can potentially be affected and that both the individual and society share responsibility for preventing relapse to alcohol abuse.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/7jVbxLuMiheDzKzjosztqRysBZQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1988-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rückfällig","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eduard Schreiber","original_name":"Eduard Schreiber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5baf53880e0a26239a0037c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137610,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wolfgang Dietzel","original_name":"Wolfgang Dietzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5baf53920e0a2623880036ec","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eduard Schreiber","original_name":"Eduard Schreiber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5baf537fc3a3687ca9004293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22803,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brigitte Krex","original_name":"Brigitte Krex","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8168e3175051003895532b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1964656,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hanna Kubin","original_name":"Hanna Kubin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8168d7d861af00398518a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7jVbxLuMiheDzKzjosztqRysBZQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
