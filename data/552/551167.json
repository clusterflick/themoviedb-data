He answers a want-ad for a job selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door. He makes no sales, especially after he fills an apartment hallway with trash to demonstrate his cleaner and then finds there is no electricity to run the machine. He comes to a house where a bridal shower is being held, with his wife in attendance, and she thinks Edgar has brought the cleaner as gift for her friend. Edgar has to take the last of their money out of the bank to pay for the demo model he had. The bank manager shows up at Edgar's house to offer him his bank job back, but Edgar's wife won't let him go back, as she has found the prefect job for Edgar... selling vacuum cleaners.","popularity":0.3493,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Clean Sweep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"5bafdb7d92514120440051e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivien Oakland","original_name":"Vivien Oakland","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/jShxUZ2SxscXXVwLCQe6y7G6AnV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Edgar (Vivian) Kennedy","credit_id":"5bafdb92c3a36814d8006804","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Dunn","original_name":"Eddie Dunn","popularity":0.175,"profile_path":"/lxKCH5fUBwf73igBfHnIjbm11Di.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Salesman Crew Boss","credit_id":"5bafdba3c3a36814d500532a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Franey","original_name":"Billy Franey","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/k1NKW0GxaRTqpe6UOGWeDcnxXrR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"5bafdbb0c3a36814d500536e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":265594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dilson","original_name":"John Dilson","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/xlskbrwdPKvGtq9uYHvdUhuy8UE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bank Manager","credit_id":"5bafdbbec3a36814cb005e90","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Sandford","original_name":"Tiny Sandford","popularity":0.232,"profile_path":"/dsfbvZOIb1rdBx8eUGa2QTYyqGE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Janitor","credit_id":"5bafdbca0e0a263a1c006394","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Miles","original_name":"Lillian Miles","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":"/eBUqR5fcKSrlshahAlCr6yYBrfq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mabel","credit_id":"5bafdbd70e0a263a20005c01","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145708,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles E.
