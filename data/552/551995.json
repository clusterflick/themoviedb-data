This pro-union but objective history, focusing on the struggle between capital and labour, and featuring the candid testimony of many unionists, was refused sanction by the ACTU and has long languished in obscurity aside from some “illegal” screenings in the early 1990s.","popularity":0.0535,"poster_path":"/eDv2agQ3JwlRCxUaxY2YILvF4Zo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about the history of the Australian Trade Union movement – starting with the Shearer’s strike of the 1890’s and leading to the present day.","title":"Amongst Equals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Zubrycki","original_name":"Tom Zubrycki","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/nPPW0pRmG7ryvsTW7Hsu324UiqE.jpg","credit_id":"5bb56e770e0a263393003a84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0101334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDv2agQ3JwlRCxUaxY2YILvF4Zo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
