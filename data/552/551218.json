Tato is married, and has been getting up even earlier to go to the Brasil neighborhood and attend Ana Luisa's hairdressing salon for 40 years. Hairstyles and cuts, it is the only thing left to offer. The hairdresser's is her refuge in the middle of a neighborhood that has become too young for their eyes. Among those who visit them is Aurora, a goddaughter who offers Ana Luisa an opportunity to try to revive the business. The plan is simple: she makes some flyers to be handed out in the square. Ana Luisa doesn't see the point of trying something like this, Tato believes that nothing is lost. They agree on one thing: handing them out will mean accepting anyone who wants to go for a cut, even the young people who they say mistreat the neighborhood.","popularity":0.072,"poster_path":"/sat0G1L33CTNN2WvF1mCFTGMxNm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90682,"logo_path":"/5RROwbMM2TNqISJUWfRrDEQu31V.png","name":"Pontificia Universidad
