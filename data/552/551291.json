Their stories are brought vividly to life through actual real-time letters and diaries as they bear witness to one of the worst wartime atrocities in history.","popularity":0.547,"poster_path":"/bDJSN6aFtmiqhVQY659sWEDBbA8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talking Drum
