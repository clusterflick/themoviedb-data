Two studio recordings, \"Forever\" and \"Purifier\" are included on the album. Singer Ed Kowalczyk said of them, \"Both songs kind of have this urgency about them, where we almost missed our deadlines. You can feel the urgency and the energy of the session in the songs\"  Despite the fact that the band was on the verge of breaking up, guitarist Chad Taylor was pleased with the DVD. \"When I saw the magic that was on camera, I was overcome by emotion. We had documented the energy and efforts of a 20-year career together.\" However, the long-standing tensions between lead singer Ed Kowalczyk and the other three band members were boiling over. \"When the album artwork showed up with Chad, Patrick and I in black and white and Ed in color it shot pain through my veins.\"","popularity":0.2121,"poster_path":"/hSYDanwhZrrANSC58z3aNRYogRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live: Live at the Paradiso Amsterdam","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Kowalczyk","original_name":"Ed Kowalczyk","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4506c3a368484e044169","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Raak","original_name":"Norbert Raak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4506c3a368484e044173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2359151","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":1291,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hSYDanwhZrrANSC58z3aNRYogRy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":10610,"name":"live"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
