The film wraps with an extensive section devoted to one of Phish's grand festivals, \"The Great Went,\" where 70,000 fans descend on the tiny village of Limestone, Maine, for a spectacular multi-day musical event. Director Todd Phillips, best known for his groundbreaking films, Hated (The GG Allin Story) and Sundance Award-winner Frat House as well as the blockbuster comedy Road Trip, reveals the fascinating phenomenon of the band — its music, loyal fans and spectacular live shows. Phillips presents a compelling film that every music fan will find fascinating.","popularity":0.4666,"poster_path":"/Aj07eqJnpVm8vC7ZH32r5dqLNeo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aviva Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":167413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stranger Than Fiction Films","origin_country":""},{"id":167414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bittersweet Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phish: Bittersweet Motel","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bittersweet Motel","type":"Standalone title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trey Anastasio","original_name":"Trey Anastasio","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/mb8V0njbIYRMA2URkMT0SyiqwnS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Trey Anastasio","credit_id":"52fe44f6c3a368484e040bdd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Fishman","original_name":"Jon Fishman","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/mkI56FyJAIzvkCdZmAPpDhbep81.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jon Fishman","credit_id":"52fe44f6c3a368484e040be1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Page McConnell","original_name":"Page McConnell","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/fxm5dxZTdXfBZve4E8O0qKT7PDb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Page McConnell","credit_id":"52fe44f6c3a368484e040be5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":195818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Gordon","original_name":"Mike Gordon","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/6uNXYoZgEugGnvDBvy5ezieeY91.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mike Gordon","credit_id":"61d6aed5b0040a0042a28145","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Todd Phillips","original_name":"Todd Phillips","popularity":0.7353,"profile_path":"/A6FPht87DiqXzp456WjakLi2AtP.jpg","credit_id":"61d6aafd700bf70018e263c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Todd Phillips","original_name":"Todd Phillips","popularity":0.7353,"profile_path":"/A6FPht87DiqXzp456WjakLi2AtP.jpg","credit_id":"5ca3e8270e0a2605a88f4890","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0168515","wikidata_id":"Q4919076","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27vompwWcwG4GcAwwakXOdvVsfI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ewXy7hmgL6xmtdMAwQPtsO9LSNb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qErzik15e3Ed6XdiPjjVeeU0CEV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qvTeCr0PbSS8ugOemWPbXnXSQqo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6d95ys8KwOlsJNAfsxG0T0r4Flt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/Aj07eqJnpVm8vC7ZH32r5dqLNeo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yo51C3f210FUdE5tfg1B6VxpxQE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qH72AXN6S0xVQBCuPt3vfpPSSua.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
