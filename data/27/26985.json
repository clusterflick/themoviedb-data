Set during the meager years of the Great Depression, 12 DOGS OF CHRISTMAS follows the story of Emma, a 12-year-old who is sent to live in Doverville, a rural town, with her aunt. The town has, like the rest of the nation, fallen on lean times and seem to have lost all interest in celebrating. However, Emma manages to enlist the town's dogs into a colorful holiday pageant that reminds the inhabitants that even the Great Depression cannot ruin the spirit of Christmas.","popularity":2.4583,"poster_path":"/9eFNLBmRL8hcHGFBPxcUejq3Pfl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alchemist
