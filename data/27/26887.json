Travis rode out of the completed trick, but re-named it the TP7 as he still needs 20 degrees of rotation to call it perfect! Chad Reed made a guest appearance as a Nitro Circus Crew member and took part in some explosive Supercross action caught in its full glory on super high speed cameras. The results were incredible! As a final gesture to confirm that Chad has really joined the Circus, he rode over to the scene of Travis' TP7 and proceeded to land his first ever backflip â€” all on his full factory 450 Suzuki!","popularity":0.4798,"poster_path":"/5GyBaEtEinwS4Cgx1sqxKTcvZaQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10558,"logo_path":"/d5hpkDfsu0tf6aIG506WilBNJ6V.png","name":"Godfrey Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nitro Circus 7 Country Fried","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Pastrana","original_name":"Travis Pastrana","popularity":0.2976,"profile_path":"/rBM4FMcqMaQeNlqugRiY62Sj5JL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe451fc3a368484e049c1b","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033333","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iOFlA1J1eUUS1aOPn5JdWwe12ra.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":2017,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l1rx03XpLOSUH9jkMWsa7CTBqD2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5GyBaEtEinwS4Cgx1sqxKTcvZaQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":9571,"name":"motor sport"},{"id":10110,"name":"motocross"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
