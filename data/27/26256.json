The end result was Fleshwound Films and the first video Crusty Demons of Dirt. The launch of this video was to change the face of motocross and create Freestyle Motocross (FMX).  For over a decade, they took their dirtbikes around the world in search of unique locations and ultimately experienced the most ridiculous adventures. Exotic locations in nineteen countries : the ruins of Machu Picchu, packed arenas in Australia, the mysterious Easter Island, wild deserts in Africa no matter where we go, nothing is ever left the same.","popularity":0.7516,"poster_path":"/lPOBgobtRWXG0bQL58TQMDboXBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleshwound Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crusty Demons of Dirt","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Crusty Demons of Dirt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Enslow","original_name":"Seth Enslow","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55b9c392c3a3684fc000036a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Hughes","original_name":"Ryan Hughes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qzFJQOA6dB9EBmDQsxYVOjRnzgY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55b9c3b3c3a3684fc0000372","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy McGrath","original_name":"Jeremy McGrath","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55b9c3c992514123d5003bf4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Manley","original_name":"Brian Manley","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55b9c3dbc3a3684afb0038aa","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1806858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":994,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lPOBgobtRWXG0bQL58TQMDboXBp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":5452,"name":"stunt"},{"id":9571,"name":"motor sport"},{"id":10110,"name":"motocross"},{"id":14735,"name":"motorcycle"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
