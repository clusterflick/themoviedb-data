It's Christmas time once again, and as usual Kevin (Moore) is scrambling to get his son Ben a last minute gift before stopping by his ex-wife Jill's house for a quick swig of eggnog. Ben can't stand Jill's impossibly perfect new boyfriend, and the prospect of spending the entire evening with his former inlaws is nearly too painful to ponder. But this Christmas things are going to be different, because this Christmas might just last forever. At first Kevin resists the curious development by simply reverting to his childish ways, though he is about to find out that sometimes in order to build a better future one must finally make amends with the past. ~ Jason Buchanan","popularity":2.4571,"poster_path":"/51DoG45RuZCiXJc49MA6QUgX1FX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3668,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas Do-Over","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":42,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Végtelen karácsony","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Minden nap karácsony","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Mohr","original_name":"Jay Mohr","popularity":0.7835,"profile_path":"/nk9q6JdcFQMLhaElN4lpUkxuqbd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b477","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphne Zuniga","original_name":"Daphne Zuniga","popularity":0.9611,"profile_path":"/jzxXGApvXYqYJKFpSH1WUnr8qCa.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jill","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b48b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Millbern","original_name":"David Millbern","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/i6cpS4vUBeETywXONjixMZhAcnv.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Todd","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b48f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrienne Barbeau","original_name":"Adrienne Barbeau","popularity":1.6717,"profile_path":"/8uQqjG63SFCkmgdFB4SG8wRQmfp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Trudi","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b47b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Thomerson","original_name":"Tim Thomerson","popularity":0.6131,"profile_path":"/dCqpmO9nDA07NYSdyQF5JYnmxpL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Arthur","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b47f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Grove","original_name":"Logan Grove","popularity":0.186,"profile_path":"/aHXuQEf3AmVuUgZ9q2A37dB0DyA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b483","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruta Lee","original_name":"Ruta Lee","popularity":1.0291,"profile_path":"/mnTHXYoZzB1QCy5vsRwicgybLgY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Granny Conlon","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b487","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2113984,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve Hart","original_name":"Steve Hart","popularity":0.291,"profile_path":"/uxeCotfiz0bdXfC7cXgJ0jDKv1Q.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Joseph Henderson","credit_id":"5b7f6edc9251416c890038a3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117157,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacqueline David","original_name":"Jacqueline David","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b46d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Cyran","original_name":"Catherine Cyran","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/qtBvphHLdTrDsnvyvNoebVCqy3Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b461","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trevor Reed Cristow","original_name":"Trevor Reed Cristow","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4526c3a368484e04b467","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Gross","original_name":"Andrew Gross","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/AvGY2z7ecsmnLHPEKNLNzmpFVh2.jpg","credit_id":"62e5c46cfdf8b70061ea459e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51966,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ken Blakey","original_name":"Ken Blakey","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e5c47d7a97ab00603e74af","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":79250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robyn Meisinger","original_name":"Robyn Meisinger","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e5c45e9f51af005f91e591","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545802,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephen P.
