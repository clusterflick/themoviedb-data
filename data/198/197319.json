The Moscow Cat Theater is just that: a traveling show of cats that perform amazing tricks for the owners who love and train them. Everybody in Russia may be used to seeing cats perform tricks, as the theater's manager explains in this funny, charming film, but felines walking tightropes, crossing the stage on giant balls and walking upside down is not a common sight in most countries. As a balalaika and accordion circus score plays in the background, Creative Director Vladimir and his daughter Maria combine their love of cats and stage to create a captivating act and illustrate the tricks of the trade - giving new meaning to the expression 'herding cats'.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Land of Fantasy & Infinite Scenarios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moscow Cat Theater","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Agrelo","original_name":"Marilyn Agrelo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/alSPD3CiaazNtSYAEOyG9cLu2Sl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c91111fdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilyn Agrelo","original_name":"Marilyn Agrelo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/alSPD3CiaazNtSYAEOyG9cLu2Sl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c91111fe3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177461,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Burke","original_name":"Michael Burke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c91111fe9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177462,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mark Augustine","original_name":"Mark Augustine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d519251416c91111fef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2385292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
