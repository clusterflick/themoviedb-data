Built in the 1960s under the supervision of modernist Mario Pani, Unidad Habitacional Nonoalco-Tlatelolco is the largest apartment complex in Mexico City. Realized at the zenith of Mexico’s economic boom, Pani’s vision of a “vertical city” beyond class distinctions has itself been shaken up on multiple occasions. Schreiber and cameraman Johannes Hammel capture the fading of an urban architectural utopia.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/krHhn8HwM9HkP7KEN6GJgBF4Dba.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tlatelolco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3287478,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rafael Ortega","original_name":"Rafael Ortega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621112193f4833001c9226a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605610,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johannes Hammel","original_name":"Johannes Hammel","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621112099f1be70071098236","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Schreiber","original_name":"Lotte Schreiber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617a51d5f2cf25002cfddd74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Schreiber","original_name":"Lotte Schreiber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617a51c971f095008b856c17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Schreiber","original_name":"Lotte Schreiber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593a246925141645a002700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Schreiber","original_name":"Lotte Schreiber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593a24f925141423f000074","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krHhn8HwM9HkP7KEN6GJgBF4Dba.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
