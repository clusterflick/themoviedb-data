But that's all in the past... until two brothers decide to bring the screen siren back to the scene of the crime. Daniel has been silently stalking Laurie for years, and when his psychotic brother Nathan is released from prison, no one expects the horror he brings. Daniel's misguided attempts to mend the wounds of a tortured youth resurrect Laurie's childhood nightmares and force Daniel to confront his own obsession, while Nathan's twisted logic takes on demonic proportions.","popularity":0.5731,"poster_path":"/2S22lYWkTJXQjeGnAj8lYFrNahf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fresh Produce Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some nightmares haunt us forever...","title":"Asylum Days","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Asylum Days - Der Killer in dir (2001)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Asylum Days - Der Killer in dir","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Asylum Days","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
