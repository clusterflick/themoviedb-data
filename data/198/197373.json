In the last decade of the 20th Century, a new heightened visibility began spreading throughout the developing world and the battles between families, fundamentalist religions, and governments around sexual and gender identity had begun. But in the West, few people knew about this historic social upheaval, until 52 men on Cairo’s Queen Boat discothèque were arrested for crimes of debauchery. That explosive story focused attention to the lives and trials of gay people coming out in the developing world and the film chronicles those events.","popularity":1.3656,"poster_path":"/gsEJSnSkCAyquqMMlV6m83QVPXP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dangerous Living is part of The Human Rights Watch Collection.","title":"Dangerous Living: Coming Out in the Developing World","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janeane Garofalo","original_name":"Janeane Garofalo","popularity":1.2408,"profile_path":"/cdNooT0otUf5QVHDPm9bkGN7gNu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"62b326a405f9cf00f0bc0d88","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598122,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adnan Ali","original_name":"Adnan Ali","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504960bd388ae00ac115b81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anat Salomon","original_name":"Anat Salomon","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65049612c92c5d00e1f3645e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Hunt","original_name":"Dan Hunt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504964f81da3900ad1e47ab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307869,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Janet Baus","original_name":"Janet Baus","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/tyBAzJ5rlkBiZqzGmCxM9ejjz8b.jpg","credit_id":"6504973bc92c5d013806a87b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3598124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hanlon","original_name":"John Hanlon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65049741d768fe00ce5e65b8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3598119,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Hanish","original_name":"Michael Hanish","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65049748c92c5d00febf082c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3598128,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shayla Sellars","original_name":"Shayla Sellars","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504974fc92c5d00ac758085","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"T.
