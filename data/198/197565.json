When three friends set out to break the world’s egg-tossing record, their relationships become increasingly entangled and complicated. In her arresting first film, director Manon Briand crafts poetic images that are striking, fresh and occasionally quirky, and elicits uncannily natural performances from her actors. Les Sauf-conduits garnered several awards on the festival circuit, including the award for Best Canadian Short Film at the 1992 Festival of Festivals (now the Toronto International Film Festival®) and Golden Sheaf Awards for Best Director and Best Film at the Yorkton Film Festival.","popularity":0.1592,"poster_path":"/ncltHd2xUTlDJ1syqYkJXDhLunU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les sauf-conduits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Lavergne","original_name":"Julie Lavergne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5a9251416c911131e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Goyette","original_name":"Patrick Goyette","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/gZz5G07JmJ1s8APr7oeIoZMnY4j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5a9251416c911131e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Picard","original_name":"Luc Picard","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/4BE3JoWuPEiYWxsSVtb73uADw9z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d5a9251416c911131ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves P.
