The reason for his visit is to take his younger brother back with him up north. However, in his home village, Severino finds a tense and troubled situation. His father Raymundo has recently been found dead. He was on the tracks of a gang of white bandits who had stolen cattle from both Indians and settlers. A sheep breeding company is behind these criminal machinations.
