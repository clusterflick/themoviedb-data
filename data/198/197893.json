This surf movie does a great job of staying far away from the politics of surfing and focuses more on soul surfing. However, don’t think that there aren’t any surfers worth watching in this movie because there are plenty. “Shelter” is jam packed with professional and well-known surfers such as Rob Machado, Taylor Knox, Joel Tudor, Mick Fanning, Dean Morrison, Jack Johnson, The Malloy’s, Kelly Slater, Nat Young, Donavon Frankenreiter, Shane Dorian, Jon Swift and many more.  The soundtrack for “Shelter” is similar to “Thicker Than Water” and “September Sessions”. It has a slower and mellower feel, featuring artists such as Mason Jennings, The Shins, White Buffalo and even surfers Jon Swift and Rob Machado.","popularity":0.4639,"poster_path":"/v7Mscq4larnd79VVqxvX8otsdpd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Machado","original_name":"Rob Machado","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/j1wHDl7aRqRTld8GsuZiesBnwDM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d669251416c91114a75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Johnson","original_name":"Jack Johnson","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/aNPho9m18zey5lV8cI9njqKYsHt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d669251416c91114a79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Slater","original_name":"Kelly Slater","popularity":0.2572,"profile_path":"/jTOFGN0ncbRHV5h5jZcKXxYBPkk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d669251416c91114a7d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Steele","original_name":"Taylor Steele","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/8KKuvDu84TEpyUiMcUaTw7WpBP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d669251416c91114a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Malloy","original_name":"Chris Malloy","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/tLhyrIfWacVXp1B24vgSjKeGsfy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d669251416c91114a89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2964,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v7Mscq4larnd79VVqxvX8otsdpd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1977},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1671,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSdRgPwjwh9QBtOXOnM6sMuP5yo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1188}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":9828,"name":"surf"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shelter Trailer","key":"qlt6fWP7AXc","published_at":"2007-05-04T23:27:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec70fc3a368544800aa0e"}]}}}
