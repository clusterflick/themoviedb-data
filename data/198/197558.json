All of the characters are in their twenties, and all are dissatisfied with modern life. Rita is hell on rollerblades and makes her free-wheeling living snatching purses and breaking into cars. She camps out in the apartment of her wealthy friend, Roxan who devotes her spare time to caring for the homeless. Lloyd is a skinhead Deejay for an alternative radio station. His self-important, outrageous ranting provides the background for the rest of the stories. Lloyd is in love with Loulou, a barmaid at a punk club. Loulou is involved in a boring relationship with liquor store clerk, Marc; she looks to Lloyd for excitement. Finally there is screwed-up Henriette, who is so busy venting her neurosis in her shrink's office that she has no time to listen to the doctor's advice.","popularity":0.4538,"poster_path":"/vks2rSrZdfQr0uvIMiRWjeI0IS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7640,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cité-Amérique","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":5023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alliance
