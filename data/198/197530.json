This doesn't stop them; they cobble together the financing and begin shooting anyway. The producer is very fond of the leading actress, and when she gets hooked on drugs for real in the course of shooting what he feels to be a farcical imitation of a film, he gives up his shares in the film and heads off for the back of beyond (Zanzibar) to lick his wounds. To add insult to injury, the film winds up being a critical and commercial success.","popularity":0.4913,"poster_path":"/xTMiuNxT7WIbRheLUo3bJIx4pfI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale de Gestion Cinématographique
