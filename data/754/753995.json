It testifies to the insanity and barbarism of war that does not stop, even through the memories of survivors, who are living with the terrible memories of war buried in the heartbreaking historical sequence where countless civilians were sacrificed. The director tells a forgotten part of history through the lives and testimonies of the survivors. It is a record of the scars of war that can never be erased, in line with the twisted modern history: Before even properly apologizing for the massacre of Vietnamese civilians caused by the dispatch of South Korean troops to Vietnam in the past, the government dispatched troops to Iraq again. - Mad Minutes: \"To soothe the boredom of American soldiers dispatched to Vietnam during the war, we give them 2-3 minutes once every two months to allow them to freely shoot at anything other than the target inside the unit.\"","popularity":0.2864,"poster_path":"/m9tBcGyDeyEbp92PZdob5IXoqWz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2003-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to experience it again","title":"Mad Minutes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Michin Sigan","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Lee","original_name":"Mario Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc2e15f4b730464fe7fdc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Hee-jeon","original_name":"Kim Hee-jeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc30a5bce9e054c76ef8c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015676,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee An-sook","original_name":"Lee An-sook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc3268e2ba60469d05870","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015677,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ma Do-won","original_name":"Ma Do-won","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc33e85c0a202fb29b442","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015678,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kong Mi-yeon","original_name":"Kong Mi-yeon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc3588e2ba60469d05881","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Lee","original_name":"Mario Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc365efd3c20505f7e91f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hong Moon-jeong","original_name":"Hong Moon-jeong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc37aefd3c2045df7e8a3","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015680,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kweon Hyeok-gu","original_name":"Kweon Hyeok-gu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc38a5bce9e052276efe9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015681,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thi Hien Trang Nguyen","original_name":"Thi Hien Trang Nguyen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dc39e5bce9e04f876f001","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5175334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbd0hDnKiFitIo76EPBsF91824Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m9tBcGyDeyEbp92PZdob5IXoqWz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2957,"name":"vietnam war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
