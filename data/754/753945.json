Flaws and all though, we loved most of these horrific endeavors.  Taking the format of ‘70s classics such as Black Christmas, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and, of course, the quintessential slasher movie, John Carpenter’s Halloween, studios realized they could make a lot of money chopping up teens. So much so that the genre would collapse in on itself like a dying star before the decade was done.","popularity":0.2172,"poster_path":"/uKCg5Y5Zf00YO3euRXH6VN84TH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story Of The '80s Slasher Craze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sean S.
