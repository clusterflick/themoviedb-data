In a time of social upheaval, Obi represents modern Nigeria. Through his gaze, his own expectations, those of his environment and the woman he loves become visible. And the disappointment of these expectations. Obi experiences the spreading corruption, the dominance of the Europeans and the conflicts with the values of traditional societies. In flashbacks, his struggle is interwoven with that of his grandfather Okonkwo. The latter experiences the first foreign influences in his village of Umuofia, from the arrival of the Christian missionaries to British colonialism.","popularity":0.5314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":221121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Calpenny Nigeria Films Limited
