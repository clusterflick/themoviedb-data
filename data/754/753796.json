It was amazing to have a Zimbabwean song topping the international music charts. This was at the height of the rave scene and Rozalla became known as ʻThe Queen of Raveʼ. This was also at a time when protests in South Africa were boiling over. In Untitled (Zimbabwean Queen of Rave) I combine some of these elements and also later events such as my experience of attending large public raves in Europe and later in Zimbabwe. The video expresses a personal reality and also the cultural gap between white and black that I was experiencing. These were two fundamentally different scenarios, yet each was guided by crowd psychology and longing for a different reality.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/646kCdDWTISRXtUxz96uzgod30k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (Zimbabwean Queen of Rave)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2816788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Halter","original_name":"Dan Halter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f88fb86d4b9d900372d3b2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2816788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Halter","original_name":"Dan Halter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f88fb908258fc0034b1942c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/646kCdDWTISRXtUxz96uzgod30k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Untitled (Zimbabwean Queen of Rave) 2005","key":"42524979","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-05-21T03:46:19.000Z","id":"5f88fc063af92900374d5dd6"}]}}}
