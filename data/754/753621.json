Despite ageing limbs and failing eyesight, the hours are full for Chachan (meaning ‘grandpa’), as he tends to his cows, visits church and follows the news and soaps on TV. As Jain records his routine, Chachan reflects on the oft-repeated patterns of local and national politics, how the fortunes of men and the rubber crop are intertwined, and the essential nature of human beings.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CHACHAN, A DAY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
