The inexplicable phenomenon breeds hostility within her community, leading to an attempt on her life. After meeting with several Buddhist masters, Fathima undertakes a journey to Kargil, Leh and Dharamsala where, in a trance, she speaks Tibetan—a language unknown to her—and is recognised as the medium for a major Buddhist deity. Upon her return home, Fathima faces a personal struggle of identity and belief.","popularity":0.0735,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fathima the Oracle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2816233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geleck Palsang","original_name":"Geleck Palsang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f888ddff3b49a0034b8112c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
