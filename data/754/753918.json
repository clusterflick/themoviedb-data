Five dancers denied their farewell performances depict a dance of longing and distance – and the necessity of saying goodbye to start anew.  In Close (Nærme in Norwegian), two film directors, two choreographers and nine dancers meet on the spectacular Main Stage of the Oslo Opera House to offer brand new ballet in a rare cinematic experience.
