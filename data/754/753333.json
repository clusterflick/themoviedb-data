She's too wrapped up in her cocaine addiction and desire to find a wealthy husband. When fashionista Madeleine begs Barnard to call Ashley for drugs, a party develops. Madeline pairs off with a rich tech executive named Boccaccio. Barnard goes home, where Ashley, seeking peace and solitude, joins him. In flashback, Barnard recalls how his best friend Pickering hired him to take photos of women's eyes. He hired Ashley and the two forged a deep connection. Back in the present, Boccaccio and Madeleine do drugs and become removed from the world.

them.","popularity":0.6016,"poster_path":"/udlNEnO5mGrooocIMr8CHPedRTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
