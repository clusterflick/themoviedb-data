Shot in the Villa la Pietra in Florence, in black and white video, and spoken in Italian, the film resembles a televised broadcast in the last days of Muammar Gaddafi. This short film sets the stage for Everson's upcoming feature, \"Rhino\" that will examine the parallel worlds of politics and performance in sixteenth century Italy and twentieth century Hollywood, through the personages of de Medici and the actress Gail Fisher (Mannix).","popularity":0.0421,"poster_path":"/zcSlE7WIXLkwzTDfvhTR2nlEVt6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47256,"logo_path":"/cY35r14vdubSlmunJtoJ85HWTsY.png","name":"Picture Palace Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":109048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trilobite-Arts-DAC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rhinoceros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2815284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Randolph Thompson","original_name":"Justin Randolph Thompson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8750b7d4b9d90037274d51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2815285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Chris","original_name":"Stephen Chris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8750c5a275020037ca3f0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2815287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Chukwu","original_name":"Daniel Chukwu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8750d26517d6003997a5f7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"5f875065a1a9ba003746e41a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"5f875075fcf907003706f253","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"5f875084a1a9ba00364b544d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"5f87508c6517d6003997a535","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"5f875099a275020037ca3ed5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8819656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zcSlE7WIXLkwzTDfvhTR2nlEVt6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
