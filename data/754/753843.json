The film refers to the survival problems faced by both the coal traders and its producers, mainly the coal miners. Black and white emphasizes not only the product of production, coal, but also the acuteness of the problem. In addition, he follows the latter throughout the production of charcoal in the forests of Evia, where they move as a family. It describes the different phases of the production process, alongside the different phases of their reflection on the future, the whole family together and each member separately. Alinda Dimitriou does not use a questionnaire to elicit their thoughts – she lets the conversation \"unravel the tangle of confessions\", as she typically said.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/a12up3KM8yehQhzYeyj49GVH9SB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coal people","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alinta Dimitriou","original_name":"Αλίντα Δημητρίου","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aW8cNPDpX9kNg5G2ZmRN6cE9b1c.jpg","credit_id":"5f893b6fa275020037cfa233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2424642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alinta Dimitriou","original_name":"Αλίντα Δημητρίου","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/aW8cNPDpX9kNg5G2ZmRN6cE9b1c.jpg","credit_id":"5f893b741443f40037c5e5cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1179868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a12up3KM8yehQhzYeyj49GVH9SB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
