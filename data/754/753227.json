The civil war in the steppes of the Aral sea region is a concrete historical background on which the life of the heroes — Aral fishermen and nomadic pastoralists-unfolds. Three dramatic fates, three characters in the center of the story: the poor farmhand Elaman, who became the leader of the masses awakened by the revolution, Bai Tanibergen, the owner of the steppe, and the beautiful Akbala. Their relationship is not a banal \"love triangle\", it is a drama that reflects the complexity of the processes that took place in the pre-revolutionary period and during the revolution.","popularity":0.2765,"poster_path":"/iezcl9CuFztPV7yiBOlClDn08lH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kazakhfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1979-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood and Sweat","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Krov i pot","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Кровь и пот","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anuarbek Moldabekov","original_name":"Әнуар Молдабеков","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/ml1TuRsmXDP7M4PbPvKmniSiMTZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f86d4ff8258fc0034aa91f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gulmyra Shaybekova","original_name":"Gulmyra Shaybekova","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f86d516a1c59d00360fed6a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2419017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tungyshbai Zhamankulov","original_name":"Tungyshbai Zhamankulov","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":"/ldfQwbIkt4uj3fhhjKyeVTkk34n.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65f6d2a081da39018662d0e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5145570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.
