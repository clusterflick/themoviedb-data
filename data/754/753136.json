It deals with the distance between a memory and the image of this memory, a distance one always tries to abolish. In this personal film we see the images of a city from a close distance, with autobiographic fragments on the soundtrack. The distance of recollection. The trace of this distance shapes the memory as much as the places, haunted by so many stories, so that our marks will blow up in a crash. A crash leading to a collapse in a vortex of affects.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/azmceokLApHEQ2AEaoHzjXJr5hJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York Long Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Beauvais","original_name":"Yann Beauvais","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/jTAHhdTQziEGqydwy6537mNSPiw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"6130204450733c0089106c53","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Beauvais","original_name":"Yann Beauvais","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/jTAHhdTQziEGqydwy6537mNSPiw.jpg","credit_id":"61302052e2586000629b7239","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1798635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martine Rousset","original_name":"Martine Rousset","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/gDt8NJ9FCBycm5DhFxBFiNzYaho.jpg","credit_id":"6130205dd207f300441514aa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yann Beauvais","original_name":"Yann Beauvais","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/jTAHhdTQziEGqydwy6537mNSPiw.jpg","credit_id":"5f8694782d8ef30039bd0bb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1602,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/azmceokLApHEQ2AEaoHzjXJr5hJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
