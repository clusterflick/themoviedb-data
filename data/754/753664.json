With the help of the mayor and the rabbit Xiaobai, Oriniu and his party defeated the lucky rabbit and Neeson, and obtained the energy ball with the magic power to control the town. To everyone's expectation, the mayor took advantage of everyone's unpreparedness and took the energy ball, and said that he was the master of Nissens.
