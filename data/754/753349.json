While waiting for a train she smiles at Bobby and he smiles back. Papa catches them at it, and horrified, hustles her away, after delivering a severe lecture on the subject of flirting. A few minutes later Pa Tubbs happens to pick up a sheet of paper on which Bobby had been industriously \"figgering,\" and finds written on it, \"My profit $50,000.\" Deciding the young man must be a millionaire in disguise, Pa Tubbs immediately makes amends by introducing his daughter to Bobby, who is rather bewildered, but tells them, \"My father is Major-Gen. Tucker.\" This augments the young man's prestige, and he is invited to spend a week at the Tubbs' home.","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Young Man Who 'Figgered'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Quirk","original_name":"Billy Quirk","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/mVRHKE8gPNB3b3BEKIZ1rAj0W4f.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bobby Tucker","credit_id":"5f873cf85a46900038f0b4a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance  Talmadge","original_name":"Constance  Talmadge","popularity":0.211,"profile_path":"/ns0qHdjv8WRgsL5wNe3I5HAc1Uq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nan Tubbs","credit_id":"5f873d0da275020039cb2eb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William Shea","original_name":"William Shea","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Papa Tubbs","credit_id":"5f873d2cf3b49a0036b4b93d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Oliver Curwood","original_name":"James Oliver Curwood","popularity":0.1485,"profile_path":"/8hhzku4GGUdcsOVrydWrtcFr6NW.jpg","credit_id":"5f873d5d2cefc200381cdc7f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Beggs","original_name":"Lee Beggs","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/uVblWzHqTbV4OTUXWi3fNbnDrZo.jpg","credit_id":"5f873d44a1a9ba00364b0e6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006326","wikidata_id":"Q21185938","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1915-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
