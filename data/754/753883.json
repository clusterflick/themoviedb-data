His real ambition is to be a movie star, and this comes a step closer when he meets an Australian photographer. But in a city where every family has a member who has been “martyred,” the streets are as perilous as they are vivid. Australia’s recent involvement with Afghanistan has been mixed, to say the best. The deeply-felt humanism of this film might just be our most effective contribution to that troubled country.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/AossDeAyShpaBiLnDZJrKBoN9yI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
