A dime rolls out of the theater which someone has dropped and Dud picks it up. In the theater they see Chaplin fighting with a donkey. When he flirts with a girl, whose back is toward him, a policeman tries to arrest him. But the donkey and the policeman collide and exchange kicks, Chaplin laughs when the policeman is kicked over. Then the donkey kicks Chaplin and he flies into the air and lands in a lake. Dud wakes up and finds his father bending over him asking what he is dreaming about.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreamy Dud Sees Charlie Chaplin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wallace A.
