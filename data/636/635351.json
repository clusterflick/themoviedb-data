His father, Bradley, is ashamed of his injuries; remembering what a 'hero' he used to be to his son. He tries to reconnect with Alex but cannot get close without scaring him. It is only after Alex grows suspicious of the masked Strangerâ€™s somewhat familiar behaviour and eventually catches a glimpse of his eyes through a gap in the bandages that he can recognise his father immediately; the wounds disappear and it becomes clear that there is a bond that runs far deeper than that which lies on the surface.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/l4b89ZSHoowT7MrDZW4ak7nvAWS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A five-year-old boy is haunted by a silent masked monster as he tries to locate his missing father.","title":"Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421724,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gabriel Page","original_name":"Gabriel Page","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d913f6c109cd0000f459301","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Watt","original_name":"Jonathan Watt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d913f4966a7c300218b9a05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kieran Charnock","original_name":"Kieran Charnock","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/cMafUBNoexI5BxQ48a2dxTVmJhB.jpg","credit_id":"5d913fd566a7c3000f8c26f3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kieran Charnock","original_name":"Kieran Charnock","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/cMafUBNoexI5BxQ48a2dxTVmJhB.jpg","credit_id":"5d913fc0172d7f000d590b64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2421723,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucy Edwards","original_name":"Lucy Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d913f6066a7c300298bf894","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Watt","original_name":"Jonathan Watt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d913f7666a7c300198bb3fb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l4b89ZSHoowT7MrDZW4ak7nvAWS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
