As he became convinced of the injustice of segregation and the inevitability of change, McGill used his front-page editorial column in the Atlanta Constitution as a Southern forum for his distinctive blend of moral outrage and pragmatic moderation. McGill's life is a touchstone for understanding the complex array of forces that dramatically reshaped the South and America in the quarter-century after World War II. These elements are blended with rare archival film, compelling contemporary images and a rich musical score to create an unusually moving and evocative film.","popularity":0.118,"poster_path":"/ouzWIH2XQzi9SZEqeOboZ9K1seh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn's Early Light: Ralph McGill and the Segregated South","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burt Lancaster","original_name":"Burt Lancaster","popularity":1.0452,"profile_path":"/hQBgFAdk1BrSum7LN4B67m3gj0U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d92969f7cffda0011fb7c0b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2009103,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jed Dannenbaum","original_name":"Jed Dannenbaum","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9296be7cffda0011fb7c4b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839545,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathleen Dowdey","original_name":"Kathleen Dowdey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9296c9168ea3002593f8ce","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839545,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathleen Dowdey","original_name":"Kathleen Dowdey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9296af7cffda0011fb7c37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1632488","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ouzWIH2XQzi9SZEqeOboZ9K1seh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
