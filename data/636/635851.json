Contrasts, juxtapositions, and intuition play significant roles in this short film. A young man on the verge of adulthood experiences an ever-changing sense of reality. By night, he suffers nightmares populated by chilling figures who seem to have a substantive physical presence and who torment his sleep. During the day, he feels somewhat comforted by the soothing routine of his home life which includes the attentive care of his mother. Layers of his childlike understanding are loosened and stripped away leaving him reeling. He comes ever closer to a deeper and more clear engagement of the truth as he now is able to understand it through the lens of his emerging individuated self. He must choose to face the whole of who is and where he comes from in order to proceed on his path to transcendent manhood or shun the facets of the shadow he encounters and remain in a state of adolescent naivete.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"158","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9804718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
