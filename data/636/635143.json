After forty-five years of work, she is asked to retire. But Voronina does not agree with that, because she thinks that all the plants will die without her. Meanwhile, a group of mysterious radioesthesists find a channel of positive energy right in front of the entrance to the pavilion.","popularity":1.2766,"poster_path":"/mMvz00lw8rAncitMRZ7otQJDXBn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123526,"logo_path":"/d5VCMBWxvLVC6YuoN637IDO6Q9o.png","name":"Mainstream Pictures
