Built with four frames within one, half of the screen in motion, the other still, this film makes the viewer feel that they are watching a \"moving picture.\" The sensation one gets is of tension...expectation...shock. It freezes one in a frame. The glorious, trenchant music of R. Murray Schafer in the background further adds to the intense \"high\" of the film.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/honeNfi8WpkTnb5a1QRJdwNNV0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gariné Torossian","original_name":"Gariné Torossian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9404b821c4ca001d7f2513","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":761,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/honeNfi8WpkTnb5a1QRJdwNNV0k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
