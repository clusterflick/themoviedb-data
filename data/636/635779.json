It is gradually revealed to be a snow ball gun. It is replete with a scope that Fido looks through to comment on their aim (\"too high,\" \"too low\"). They successfully knock the top hat off a passing gentlemen two times in succession. Then they hit a washer woman in the head. She pursues them, getting pelted as she approaches the snow bank. Bobby and Fido take flight, pulling the gun on a small cart behind them. The washer woman runs after them. They climb a hill leaving marks in the snow. The washer woman follows.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/k2Vf0EkuokS3SeqbJkB0wMrOAbH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34878,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.R.
