A telegram calls him hurriedly away. He replaces the papers in his safe, but, in his haste, neglects to lock it, which oversight is pardonable, as his wife and daughter are in the room at the time. The daughter's hand is sought in marriage by a worthy young man, whose attentions are looked upon with favor by herself and her parents. But he has a rival in the person of a contemptible villain, whose motives are purely mercenary, reasoning that this new invention will greatly enhance the father's already ample wealth.","popularity":0.3919,"poster_path":"/im1zoVzZKVQyAH5rq9H5Nf6oTSP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falsely Accused!","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dillon","original_name":"Edward Dillon","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/lRWa2M2guVQUo4GCMPComWsds79.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Inventor","credit_id":"5d9256f4cee2f6001a793f3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
