Starring BAFTA nominated Kevan Brighting as the voice actor from the original Stanley Parable indie game and Tristan Coates as Jack. The Stanley Parable is a game about game design, a surreal interactive satire on its medium. While adapting this concept to film, we translated the satirical themes into a commentary on film making; developing the story and style simultaneously to build the world of the writer.  VFX played an important part in creating a world similar to The Stanley Parable. Using green screens and camera tracking we were able to recreate the shifting environment in the game and place the film in an artificial setting.","popularity":0.2143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is a film about a man, a man named Jack.","title":"Jack","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jack: A Stanley Parable Short Film","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevan Brighting","original_name":"Kevan Brighting","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"580b081c9251414e84008911","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tristan Coates","original_name":"Tristan Coates","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"589dfae0c3a3685f8000a819","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697790,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Hailes","original_name":"Chris Hailes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08309251414e800078b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697790,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Hailes","original_name":"Chris Hailes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b0837c3a368296b007026","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenni Potter","original_name":"Jenni Potter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08499251414e7a007858","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697792,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Horia Dragoi","original_name":"Horia Dragoi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b0856c3a368295e008033","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697792,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Horia Dragoi","original_name":"Horia Dragoi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08619251414e8900786d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697793,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rebecca Lawrence","original_name":"Rebecca Lawrence","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b088b9251414e87007e17","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697793,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rebecca Lawrence","original_name":"Rebecca Lawrence","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08949251414e78007bbe","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697794,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Beckwith","original_name":"James Beckwith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08a79251414e84008963","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oren Locke","original_name":"Oren Locke","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08b2c3a368296e007776","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oren Locke","original_name":"Oren Locke","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580b08bcc3a3682964007545","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":41645,"name":"based on video game"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jack - A Stanley Parable Short Film ft.
