The work intercuts two differing cinematic approaches: one that explores the observational potential of the medium through wide-angle, 360-degree shots that pan over the changing desert landscape, and the other that appropriates familiar visual tropes taken from the Hollywood Western movie genre—such as pistols, Levi's jeans, boot spurs, and leather chaps—and implements them in a performance. The soundtrack is an edited compilation of two of De Maria's \"drum compositions,\" \"Cricket Music\" (1964) and \"Ocean Music\" (1968), which creates a sense of anticipation for the viewer. In the last minute of the film, a series of unexpected events unfolds in rapid succession, producing a dramatic climax.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/iX7Seh5XB9vbEmsJ7ETVYtYQ4IO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dilexi Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":173595,"logo_path":null,"name":"KQED-TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hardcore","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Blair Stapp","original_name":"Blair Stapp","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"625ba16e65c26c009a2ecab1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Heizer","original_name":"Michael Heizer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self - Guest","credit_id":"625ba197dd731b0051d94e8d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter De Maria","original_name":"Walter De Maria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ba13b957e6d00688d6aa4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":79980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Coney","original_name":"John Coney","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ba0fed266a200516c1139","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621179,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Farber","original_name":"Jim Farber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ba1239408ec11f96a365d","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter De Maria","original_name":"Walter De Maria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61493e7b1689350064f0ef07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241994,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Blair Stapp","original_name":"Blair Stapp","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61493e8f5e12000063d2c2d9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter De Maria","original_name":"Walter De Maria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61493e6f2dffd8002b98a4e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter De Maria","original_name":"Walter De Maria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580c2bed925141712c008eac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5609172","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iX7Seh5XB9vbEmsJ7ETVYtYQ4IO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gagosian Online - Broadcast: Alternate Meanings in Film and Video","release_date":"2020-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
