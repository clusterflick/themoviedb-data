Basketball provided him a way out and in foregoing college to play hoops, he irrevocably changed the rules of how the game was played from the very top echelons of the NBA. As a 20-year old former Olympian, Haywood sue the NBA for the right to turn pro without finishing college. The case went to the Supreme Court and in 1971, the Court's decided in favor of Haywood. Subsequently, the decision abolished the NBA's mandatory draft eligibility requirement of four years of college. The ruling paved the way for today's NBA's superstars like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Kevin Garnett to bypass college and play in NBA teams right out of high school.","popularity":0.3353,"poster_path":"/66d2uYydrayzTXKjGrRnB4517gy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Court Battle of Epic Proportions","title":"Full Court: The Spencer Haywood Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2842123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Haywood","original_name":"Spencer Haywood","popularity":0.0854,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa16773875d1a00361736c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck D","original_name":"Chuck D","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/bKUsmjaGJYqKF0iRmKrGfTbxJ2W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6417f95131032500e8a297eb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842128,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Ellison","original_name":"Paul Ellison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa167b4c669ad00383291d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842125,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kim Clemmons","original_name":"Kim Clemmons","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa1679e3a9650003aada1a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Spirit","original_name":"Martin Spirit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa167895a5ed000384cb211","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5684148","wikidata_id":"Q26832842","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKlfM8wQIpVyczkSkKkxWLL2vWK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/66d2uYydrayzTXKjGrRnB4517gy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
