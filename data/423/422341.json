Silky, Mahima, Trisha, Durga, Kuyili, Priyanka, Vasundhara and Yamuna, under the firm protection of their guru Lakshmi Ma, deliver snippets of their marginal but sovereign existence. From a millenia-old sacred tradition to getting by every second, \"Guru\" composes with them a poem of intertwined voices in which the world is a tough playground, where the third gender is primarily the resistance force of a life shared.","popularity":0.316,"poster_path":"/e51QJ5l9polkCDDFc2Z2ls2nylY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8471,"logo_path":"/rfmlWuH9lxt9pgQetWbNwZKSXvZ.png","name":"Tarantula","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":58666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opening Night Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":112963,"logo_path":"/ccSxSr2Kgdt6jzAjHHvDn8K3xKD.png","name":"Kolam Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19840,"logo_path":"/wMwpc8pEyLec92n33kr4Px2378D.png","name":"Wallonie Image Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guru, A Hijra Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Guru, Hijra From Inside","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Guru, Portrait of a Hijra Family","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697994,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Laurie Colson","original_name":"Laurie Colson","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580bd0409251417138005b5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axelle Le Dauphin","original_name":"Axelle Le Dauphin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580bd0509251417138005b6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5036422","wikidata_id":"Q27042953","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ioUsrd5hBDTlwnDzEmdpuGZ6O1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gfdNYyfv9yZyHeBWc0dKTuEVF4W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5qsbhSflrgFF0JSChQyReBps0OU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ZZKUPg9XfAq1Xw6JEREvsHNOAG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oaLgcxiGe9DQL1xxAPYIE3lu9bM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e51QJ5l9polkCDDFc2Z2ls2nylY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":215588,"name":"hijras"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
