Another woman finds it and without revealing whose bracelet it belongs to, she gives it to an ardent Calvary officer admirer at the ball. This leads to deeper and deeper incisions upon the urbane social body of Tsarist Russia.  A drama of pride, marital distrust, gambling, infidelity and humiliation twirls around the decaying corpse of a perverted social class.","popularity":0.2111,"poster_path":"/ajGlGPo9XRwSPb3ffRCHrgp7nLz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1941-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masquerade","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Mordvinov","original_name":"Nikolai Mordvinov","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/mGTb3tSQ3mTBApqUtob6LflnE0Z.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Arbenin","credit_id":"5b71d9900e0a267ef119f242","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Makarova","original_name":"Тамара Макарова","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/AqpreLHjJBpNqhalBH65nUgpO6A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"580f06edc3a3687b3b006dce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Sadovsky","original_name":"Mikhail Sadovsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Knyaz Zvezdich","credit_id":"580f072e9251416623007398","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1075591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofiya Magarill","original_name":"Софья Магарилл","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/x5YjKCIJH097kqoAEfn2PsAmnj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Baroness Shtral","credit_id":"580f075cc3a3687b3b006e13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonin Pankryshev","original_name":"Antonin Pankryshev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"580f0788c3a3687bc9006c2e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyubov Sokolova","original_name":"Любовь Соколова","popularity":0.2898,"profile_path":"/lm1Om88PI9K5LMb7xw7WrsmXTCy.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5b71d7fe92514168b61039b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":624719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Gerasimov","original_name":"Сергей Герасимов","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/gC2I7YQPAKBwNkHVWWIF4nQOH75.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5b71d826c3a368188819412b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1699293,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"P.
