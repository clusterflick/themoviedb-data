They were promised an abundance of game and fish - in short, a better life. The government assured the Inuit that if things didn't work out, they could return home after two years. Two years later, another 35 people joined them. It would be thirty years before any of them saw their ancestral lands again.  Abandoned in flimsy tents, the Inuit were left to fend for themselves in the desolate settlements of Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord, where the sea was nearly always frozen and darkness reigned for months on end. Suffering from hunger, extreme cold, sickness, alcoholism and poverty, Québec's Inuit had become the victims of a government policy supposedly designed to return them to their \"native state\". Evidence points to the government's wish to strengthen Canada's sovereignty in the Arctic as playing a part in the decision to relocate.","popularity":0.0887,"poster_path":"/MxtcJ363REqRBQOERA2hcMWNUY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale des Industries Culturelles du Québec (SOGIC)","origin_country":""},{"id":82579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nutaaq Média Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Promises: The High Arctic Relocation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Usiimmaluguq","type":"Inuktitut"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erna Buffie","original_name":"Erna Buffie","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"58095d0a925141378d001ba9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Haig","original_name":"Don Haig","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dd8193e9da690e50c43ac0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricia V.
