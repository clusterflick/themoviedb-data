First, we show various proofs including scientific studies which indicate there are no atheists. Second, we show atheism renders basic things everybody agrees on meaningless. It is proved that atheism is unable to account for the validity of reason, empirical observation, the possibility of knowledge, moral absolutes, the uniformity of nature, the laws of logic, and human dignity. In fact, these issues render atheism impossible. We argue since atheists assume these things this means they are not atheists but closet believers.","popularity":0.2252,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Presuppositionalist Critique of Atheism","title":"Atheists Don't Exist","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Thompson","original_name":"Keith Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"580bd477c3a3682286006182","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Bahnsen","original_name":"Greg Bahnsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"580bd51e925141713b005ccc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Thompson","original_name":"Keith Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580bd48fc3a368296400e687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186,"name":"christianity"},{"id":161203,"name":"atheism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
