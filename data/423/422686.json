Sixteen years passed before she had the courage to delve into this trove, unearthing details that her mother had recorded about every aspect of her life from the challenges of her marriage to a State Senator, to her sonâ€™s estrangement, to her struggles with bipolar disorder. HERE ONE DAY is a visually arresting, emotionally candid film about a woman coping with mental illness, her relationships with her family, and the ripple effects of her suicide on those she loved.","popularity":0.4943,"poster_path":"/m4I7yNDsXXoW2YgINOSup2ckWNI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here One Day","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathy Leichter","original_name":"Kathy Leichter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b593ca09251414d20004be3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1732823,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Judy Karp","original_name":"Judy Karp","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b593cf00e0a2611f50050a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathy Leichter","original_name":"Kathy Leichter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b593e0e0e0a2611fe005451","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1641027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pola Rapaport","original_name":"Pola Rapaport","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/g7PRDm1mq6aZQDYCFeaCHJkv1V0.jpg","credit_id":"5b593e14c3a36801e9005e7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten Johnson","original_name":"Kirsten Johnson","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/9h1DYSYLnPujVBtM4mklFDnZByj.jpg","credit_id":"5d4c129ac68b6900110f14cb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1000854,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nathan Halpern","original_name":"Nathan Halpern","popularity":0.2,"profile_path":"/kFKPw61KwSYhmmkDsQGMv1MzYj0.jpg","credit_id":"5d4c139cc68b6900110f16cc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1641027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pola Rapaport","original_name":"Pola Rapaport","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/g7PRDm1mq6aZQDYCFeaCHJkv1V0.jpg","credit_id":"5d4c13ab4dc34a00126343ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8019836","wikidata_id":"Q63441152","facebook_id":"HereOneDay","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2659,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m4I7yNDsXXoW2YgINOSup2ckWNI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":172773,"name":"suicide of mother"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2012-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cleveland International Film Festival","release_date":"2013-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
