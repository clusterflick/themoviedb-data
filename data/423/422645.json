In 1973, his extraordinary multi-racial coalition redefined Los Angeles, transformed the national dialogue on race, and set the foundation for sustainable interracial coalitions that encouraged elections of minority candidates nationwide, most notably President Barack Obama. The film brings into sharp focus issues of police brutality in minority communities and the challenges of police reform. BRIDGING THE DIVIDE is the story of the pressures which face our cities, the politics of race and the complexities of coalitions in a changing America.","popularity":0.3617,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bridging the Divide: Tom Bradley and the Politics of Race","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyn Goldfarb","original_name":"Lyn Goldfarb","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cb3b2105adfb9eb95b808f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5039882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bridging the Divide: Tom Bradley and the Politics of Race (Trailer)","key":"7jXOdnjJBpg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-08T01:01:14.000Z","id":"63da0ef4955c6500a0ecb833"}]}}}
