A street, passers-by, a sunset, all accompanied by electronic humming: Current Shot 01 consists of a single 15-min shot [...] But the apparent stillness of the shot turns out to be deceptive: while no movement can be seen, the figures' shadows have changed, and a third suddenly leaves the cluster it formed with the other two. As a results of the extreme slow motion, this slight movement can only be recognised after the fact. Like a picture puzzle where you have to look for the differences, the detail oscillates between animated photography, film still and tableau vivant.\r ~ Alexandra Seibel","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Current Shot 01","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Kushima","original_name":"Stefan Kushima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580d7457c3a368258f01433e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Gerlach","original_name":"Philippe Gerlach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580d7449925141712c0151ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
