Sasamoto writes about accomplished people both famous and unknown. Her photographs have always reflected ever-changing times, vividly depicting women during and after WWII. Muno, an extraordinary journalist, resigned from his newspaper job on the day Japan lost the war, out of remorse for writing pro-war articles. He left Tokyo for his hometown and founded \"Taimatsu (Torch)\" to keep his journalism alive. At 101 Sasamoto claims her life is ongoing. Muno says he’s at the pinnacle of his life. We have a lot to learn from their optimism.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/3BVGeM0aaZGU1FWetsduEHf4RlL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Journalists: One Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1700136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeji Muno","original_name":"Takeji Muno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58116691c3a368795500f2f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1700137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsuneko Sasamoto","original_name":"Tsuneko Sasamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5811669a9251414f9b00f82b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Atsunori Kawamura","original_name":"Atsunori Kawamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58116686925141579e00f48a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5891730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3BVGeM0aaZGU1FWetsduEHf4RlL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
