At the heart of the story is Salazar’s transformation from a mainstream, establishment reporter to primary chronicler and supporter of the radical Chicano Movement of the late 1960s. Killed under mysterious circumstances by a law enforcement officer in 1970, Salazar became an instant martyr to Latinos — many of whom had criticized his reporting during his lifetime. Adding to the Salazar mystique is that the details of how he was killed have been obscured in the ensuing four decades since his death.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/52dcNixKi9sNyNvy1SDv4Lx3CVd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruben Salazar: Man in the Middle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3501232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/52dcNixKi9sNyNvy1SDv4Lx3CVd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
