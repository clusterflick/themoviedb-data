Colours and transparencies pose as gels and lenses until the sequence shifts, making materials behave unnaturally--mixing up insides with outsides; light with colour; time with place; left with right, forced together to prevent any physical point of contact. A filmic and sculptural enquiry into the depth and slippage between a two-dimensional field and its actual location in three-dimensional space.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (Objects 3)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Michael","original_name":"Sophie Michael","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580d6ad7c3a368249d011c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
