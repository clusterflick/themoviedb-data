The separatist movement is gaining ground in Catalonia. Notwithstanding the Spanish Constitution (which states that Spain is indivisible, making any referendum thereby unconstitutional), 2.3 million people voted in the November 2014 de facto referendum.

Seizing this historic moment, filmmaker Alexandre Chartrand gives a voice to the civil society figures who have been propelled to centre stage in national politics.","popularity":0.4107,"poster_path":"/ztmG1UMFt273dRV1U0yWYaY8Vl0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Chartrand","original_name":"Alexandre Chartrand","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58117261c3a3687aa0010675","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztmG1UMFt273dRV1U0yWYaY8Vl0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":514,"name":"spain"},{"id":4109,"name":"independence movement"},{"id":9566,"name":"catalonia, spain"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
