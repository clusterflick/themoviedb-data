But suddenly all Gayans are facing imminent danger when a magic stone which protects their world, \"the Dalamite\", is beamed away by a mysterious force. Three Snurks immediately go after it, hoping to be the heroes for once. They are shortly followed by some standout Zeldons: Zino the trouble-prone popular guy & his sidekick, clever but somewhat cowardly inventor Boo, as well as rebel princess Alanta. Their journey ends up leading them all on a dangerous interdimensional quest to find the stone, while they must also figure out a way to get back to Gaya.","popularity":1.691,"poster_path":"/daqf0AgiiBAzbOyEJMn3LPr8HbZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambient Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2395,"logo_path":"/pZz4qs03FtP6UGtZ3hjQ6qimcwi.png","name":"HanWay Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10031,"logo_path":"/cUOviFxM9l3dYuNeg89giHUaqkd.png","name":"Morena Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-03-18","revenue":2844511,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to Gaya","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":94,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Monde fabuleux de Gaya","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Snurks","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Boo, Zino & the Snurks","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Nel magico mondo di Gaya","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Az elveszett kristály nyomában","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Back To Gaya - Pequenos Herois","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Gaya'ya Dönüş","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"A Terra Encantada de Gaya","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","title":"Tierra Mágica","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"En busca de la piedra mágica","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Herbig","original_name":"Michael Herbig","popularity":0.4521,"profile_path":"/ApYc3APLOcOH2SpgFCxbrYpxx7h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Boo (voice)","credit_id":"52fe43d29251416c7501f855","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torsten Münchow","original_name":"Torsten Münchow","popularity":0.1817,"profile_path":"/iborBDfERekmz40DzVDxAqAiCUo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zino (voice)","credit_id":"52fe43d29251416c7501f861","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Petruo","original_name":"Vanessa Petruo","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alanta (voice)","credit_id":"52fe43d29251416c7501f859","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Völz","original_name":"Wolfgang Völz","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/fPqX1DCihe3IT5fjPDI6A8dky9m.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mayor (voice)","credit_id":"52fe43d29251416c7501f865","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Büschken","original_name":"Uwe Büschken","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Chad (voice)","credit_id":"6565c321c2b9df013ae3d7ee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Sonnenschein","original_name":"Klaus Sonnenschein","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Galger (voice)","credit_id":"6565c36d156cc700ca7049a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bodo Wolf","original_name":"Bodo Wolf","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/uSEtdt3jKFG5CegNd0xUjusz67r.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Professor N.
