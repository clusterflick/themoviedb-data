As a public relations gag, he hasn't paid his parking fines for two years and now insists on being sentenced to jail for two weeks as punishment. Using his knowledge as a lawyer he makes the best out of his visit in jail still working, still in a splendid mood and not adapting to any rule. Probably a good way to get the desired public attention, but also a good way to make enemies inside the jail-house. One day before Konrad is to be released his booth is searched and two hundred grams of cocaine are found. That's a serious problem even for a brilliant lawyer like Konrad and even if you're innocent","popularity":0.859,"poster_path":"/njygNL24AuOhwulcGKewxIn01cx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"14 Days to Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"14 Days to life","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"14 días de vida","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Wiesinger","original_name":"Kai Wiesinger","popularity":0.2427,"profile_path":"/bgLlyH4q0yMgutWN2LvLTlB9Ur4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Konrad von Seidlitz","credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e26b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mendl","original_name":"Michael Mendl","popularity":0.2585,"profile_path":"/3RrIh45zEvRtyq9kG6qyh52a2I8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Viktor Czernetzky","credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e26f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Meinecke","original_name":"Katharina Meinecke","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/kbKxQv5fwpawgNrbIHDL0G0ckMm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Annika Hofer","credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e273","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Pape","original_name":"Axel Pape","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/dAHTOGV70H86EuJxW8cvcJCT9NZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Axel Häring","credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e277","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Leifheit","original_name":"Sylvia Leifheit","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/q0bf5m5mOk5YHZf6U0IP8RfHqS1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Cornelia Volkerts","credit_id":"5339d3b19251417da1004ea3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Milberg","original_name":"Axel Milberg","popularity":0.256,"profile_path":"/eK1Kkda8rOZMgo5BYBUVeYenOwj.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Roland Kleinschmidt","credit_id":"5339d3f39251417d9b004f0b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürgen Schornagel","original_name":"Jürgen Schornagel","popularity":0.0438,"profile_path":"/wmCxgJMnb6dUtglt9AMyUwTSiOn.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Kaschinski","credit_id":"5339d4109251417da4004d17","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Detlef Bothe","original_name":"Detlef Bothe","popularity":0.2984,"profile_path":"/zhyY3UItsuekeNYqUkauLOGqnsd.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Rudi","credit_id":"5339d44c9251417da1004eaa","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Illig","original_name":"Rolf Illig","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Schröder","credit_id":"5339d4959251417dad004c0b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Mulzer","original_name":"Hubert Mulzer","popularity":0.3757,"profile_path":"/89SZp95vedOHjKP6DmeFJaql5I2.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Oberwachtmeister Kaiser","credit_id":"5339d4ec9251411302003bc3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Stegemann","original_name":"Bernd Stegemann","popularity":0.2679,"profile_path":"/nYZd0Svq5znrumIb2uXrWgwx84l.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Kruse","credit_id":"5339d5179251411302003bc8","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Fitz","original_name":"Peter Fitz","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/uuS2Tbva1PdAeMxFKUjlO1V7eJN.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Direktor","credit_id":"5339d5959251417d9b004f2e","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Suso Richter","original_name":"Roland Suso Richter","popularity":0.1552,"profile_path":"/fsbhjKcZ0ZEOj8bGjVoLY2emDZJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e27d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Holger Karsten Schmidt","original_name":"Holger Karsten Schmidt","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/ykJjexcLM401HvPiwowQpaXZJca.jpg","credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e283","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21739,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Langer","original_name":"Martin Langer","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe43619251416c7500e289","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":703,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter R.
