Rochus' domineering mother insists that he enter the priesthood, but he is reluctant to break up his blissful romance with the fair Judith. A religious fanatic of the first order, the mother swears before God and her Church that Rochus will indeed take his vows. When this does not come about, she dies of grief, whereupon the guilt-stricken Rochus abandons Judith to become a priest. The girl subsequently commits suicide -- and it is Rochus who must officiate over her body during the funeral. This final scene was excised from the print of Zwei Menschen released in New York, leaving audiences hanging in regard to Judith's ultimate fate.","popularity":0.3652,"poster_path":"/66PD2cfZ5deOyfL7ehxOn5MQ0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Souls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Susa","original_name":"Charlotte Susa","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/thn0iHOjN9LeRMH7kg2hwvQGV7P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"616863276818880065032475","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Fröhlich","original_name":"Gustav Fröhlich","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/bkjDaorTT3LcOeTcQF1TDpBlHwt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6168632d81c7be0065e7575c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich Kayssler","original_name":"Friedrich Kayssler","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/oIkGeU4uRMQSr0tqp182bqTCJfT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6168633281c7be0043a7aae0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Alberti","original_name":"Fritz Alberti","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/qCQhv7RCYwEZJ8l0Hs0ToXZIAP7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6168633881c7be00927fa7ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermine Sterler","original_name":"Hermine Sterler","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":"/iTjorkYjHPnLoMG9EcbiJnm4UCq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6168633ef6596f00661781af","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Platen","original_name":"Karl Platen","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/pD8jhGfCS1Dw8AZYZIh1TcwEWKS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6329269eaf85de007c7ea91a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Aldor","original_name":"Bernd Aldor","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/utG3IdwSw2mMeBsJ9LyFHkt60a8.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"632926a41f98d1009231510f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Nestor","original_name":"Harry Nestor","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"632926a9b6abc40091ff01b1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1097115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Englisch","original_name":"Lucie Englisch","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/5SDKYcw7PAhJr1FLT7O9LQAs3ig.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"632926affd6300007f68770f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodor Loos","original_name":"Theodor Loos","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/9PbtusE5TJYfyQrWb6brBXuXTLX.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"632926b5524978007e9f3fe6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich Ettel","original_name":"Friedrich Ettel","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"632926bb1f98d1007e5c1424","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2107570,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Voss","original_name":"Richard Voss","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61686348f6596f00929c95f5","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans H.
