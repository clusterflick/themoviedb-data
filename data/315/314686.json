Tracks include \"Too Wild to Tame,\" \"Trash Queen,\" \"Sweet Surrender,\" \"Law Abuzer\" and more.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/tggOqL5lgcNoFESnnjtszpHlSPd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrathchild: Live from London","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Wrathchild: Live from London","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Wrathchild: War Machine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocky Shades","original_name":"Rocky Shades","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7VV4znxRfOMdhYSeOor3PgRpwT6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"5d9c28b46d675a0012f2d524","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Rocket","original_name":"Lance Rocket","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gADZJCfjtnCsahPVaXCMJQ1gV0t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"5d9c28d16b5fc20013d805bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Angel","original_name":"Marc Angel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nUpogwQX2i1O5MBkHKcDYwTul3O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5d9c28e5d388ae003313ef8b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Star","original_name":"Eddie Star","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5d9c28f56b5fc20013d80637","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tggOqL5lgcNoFESnnjtszpHlSPd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
