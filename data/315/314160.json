Love In Venice is an evening full of wonderful Italian music, world hits like Funiculi funicula, Tiritomba and Vieni sul mar and fabulous operatic arias. For the occasion of this anniversary, the Italian singer Rocco Granata came to sing his world hit Marina.\r Thanks to the perfect sound and image recordings on this DVD you can enjoy it at home just as though you were there yourself.","popularity":0.585,"poster_path":"/m1xwTnzJCJ9u2LCMIbHHrZvzpUe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60911,"logo_path":"/Atub6EGDrBdErV4qz6OakSGhrd.png","name":"André Rieu Studios","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André Rieu - Love in Venice","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"ANDRE RIEU LOVE IN VENICE","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Rieu","original_name":"André Rieu","popularity":0.2261,"profile_path":"/toabyJ2w8pNf1xM0oJPWSawDpMB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Conductor, Violinist","credit_id":"54a0190e925141236b00195c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/57XI3rBPTBOZbPWNHZrvn1TiYlg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m1xwTnzJCJ9u2LCMIbHHrZvzpUe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1407,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wObuAtEsFbIXro7YTdtodOCLbcm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
