The “Twilight Zone”-ish plot centres around middle-aged and balding station master Ruben, who is plagued by the vision of ghostly train. The train is always arriving at midnight to the accompaniment of eerie music whenever somebody in town has died. Swearing local priest Don Carmelo is skeptical. The main performance of Rafael Hernandez is competent and there is a bit of soft nudity provided by lovely Mari Paz Pondal.","popularity":0.3551,"poster_path":"/eCFEVwot76nX2qPoCQ9KUewbBWs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terror on the Midnight Train","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Terror en el tren de la medianoche","type":"video title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Terror on the Midnight Train","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Hernández","original_name":"Rafael Hernández","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/aOFGTGTLvDeWlM6Si5PfoKvd2gW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rubén","credit_id":"5e4bbe559a3c49001632dc36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Paz Pondal","original_name":"Mary Paz Pondal","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/kvuyyuyEjyMBvmcaOmAHB1aqzCh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"54a08754925141312900bd58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Riesgo","original_name":"José Riesgo","popularity":0.197,"profile_path":"/yNUDnP93jkH6fygM29mJtUSX9M6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Don Carmelo","credit_id":"54a0876592514121270023d7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Iglesias","original_name":"Manuel Iglesias","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a08776925141312900bd5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":40885,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio Fos","original_name":"Antonio Fos","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c72ba58c3a3685a351632a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Iglesias","original_name":"Manuel Iglesias","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c72ba760e0a262c187e5254","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693447,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José Andrés Alcalde","original_name":"José Andrés Alcalde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c72ba949251415ee8b38cca","department":"Crew","job":"Photoscience Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0081618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":763,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/eCFEVwot76nX2qPoCQ9KUewbBWs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3284,"name":"phantom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
