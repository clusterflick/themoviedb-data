(Her life became the basis for the movie Million Dollar Baby). Irish musician Graham Sharpe’s career was on the rise when advancing tinnitus caused a ringing in his ears so bad that it put an end to his rock-and-roll dreams. Sculptor Alice Wingwall experienced complete loss of sight from a degenerative eye disease. Game over for these three, right? Not so fast. Each managed to struggle, innovate, and, ultimately, through their art, transform themselves into someone new.","popularity":0.2961,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit/Will/Loss","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shoulder the lion","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O sentido da criação","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Dallam","original_name":"Katie Dallam","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54a1a42e9251414e2800855b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grahame Sharpe","original_name":"Grahame Sharpe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54a1a43ac3a3682f1b00d38f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Wingwall","original_name":"Alice Wingwall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54a1a44492514121270042b6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405847,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erinnisse Rebisz","original_name":"Erinnisse Rebisz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a1a3f5c3a368764f009afd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patryk Rebisz","original_name":"Patryk Rebisz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a1a3cf9251414d270080ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405847,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erinnisse Rebisz","original_name":"Erinnisse Rebisz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563ea9a392514129fe01e3bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2988036","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12660,"name":"blind"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":160213,"name":"festival"},{"id":164715,"name":"photo"},{"id":174818,"name":"brain damage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
