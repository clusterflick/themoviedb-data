On any weekend, there may be no better place to find out what makes America great than at a flea market. A Flea Market Documentary is an unabashed celebration of the unusual people and the enticing things that can be found in parking lots, fairgrounds, drive-ins, sidewalks, and wherever else someone has posted a sign saying \"Flea Market.\"  It's capitalism mixed with craziness. It's amazing old stuff, great salespeople, the ancient tradition of the open-air market, and the possibility of finding a bargain, all uniting shoppers across the nation.  Produced by WQED Pittsburgh, A Flea Market Documentary travels from the gigantic Rose Bowl Market in Pasadena, California, to the busy but modest- sized Eastern Market in Washington, DC, talking with organizers, vendors, food merchants and shoppers.","popularity":0.5211,"poster_path":"/vUD8N1RHP2Q8V41lpme9E5HuL4d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Flea Market Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ece0f1a528b2e001e63bec1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank DeCaro","original_name":"Frank DeCaro","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ece116d21c4ca0020db8d9f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hanneford III","original_name":"George Hanneford III","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ece119521c4ca0021db2a50","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5e261981b39e350017a4eb24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyn Hough","original_name":"Jocelyn Hough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece11d6aaec71001f66184f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5ece11b721c4ca0020db8dd6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655865,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Bob Lubomski","original_name":"Bob Lubomski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece1244e4b57600202a28c5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655857,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Buck Brinson","original_name":"Buck Brinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece121121c4ca0020db8e0b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103062,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin Conrad","original_name":"Kevin Conrad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece1225528b2e001f638ae1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656025,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Minette Seate","original_name":"Minette Seate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece11f1aaec71001f661863","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5ece120221c4ca0021db2a9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547727,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shawn Jackson","original_name":"Shawn Jackson","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece1236e4b576001f2a61e9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0292516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aTEuzHdYSd5vWVIwgaUZiS3UL2R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vUD8N1RHP2Q8V41lpme9E5HuL4d.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4UGrXJnbSvCifgaEAKmsaD8HVAe.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4294,"name":"flea market"},{"id":193594,"name":"pittsburgh, pennsylvania"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
