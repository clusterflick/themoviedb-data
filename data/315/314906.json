Like the earlier picture, Loyalty is a historical drama. During the period in which Italy was under Austrian rule, Count Federico (Nerio Bernardi) fights tirelessly to free his people from oppression. The Count's wife Teresa (Marta Alba) remains loyally by his side, even when he is unfaithful to her, which is often. Federico doesn't realize how important Teresa is to him, nor how much he loves her, until it's almost too late. At time of the release of Loyalty of Love, star Marta Alba had transferred her base of operations to New York, where she starred in Broadway production of Tovarich.","popularity":0.2723,"poster_path":"/fGUxcNxwmsZ6TTm5H2n74EmmuxY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loyalty of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1591659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Abba","original_name":"Marta Abba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57a73627c3a36822480000dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nerio Bernardi","original_name":"Nerio Bernardi","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/sFt9XjJo2rq1NAuAZDT62DOrkJw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7362ec3a36822fd0000b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Cimara","original_name":"Luigi Cimara","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/fYri9NEAQJOOYOPtqBlDRuXtxl9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57a73634925141510a002a07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa De Giorgi","original_name":"Elsa De Giorgi","popularity":0.1639,"profile_path":"/yLtvHh7ab9cwu6uOW32atmaq9RS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7363bc3a36801a5000d6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1042794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filippo Scelzo","original_name":"Filippo Scelzo","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57a73643c3a368383d002234","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Carini","original_name":"Luigi Carini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/lhT9odKjNkEGWhdrBMHXvb0kOYH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57a73649c3a36822fd0000cc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Tassani","original_name":"Riccardo Tassani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57a73653c3a368256c0029c3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Lattanzi","original_name":"Tina Lattanzi","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/9eSt0pbQ0T4KIy1db0DCUKotd5W.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7365c92514130bd0000bf","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guido Brignone","original_name":"Guido Brignone","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":"/vGm4yf84kdag9RmwuXoQUjSmrmZ.jpg","credit_id":"54a3ab5992514117dd003d58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rino Alessi","original_name":"Rino Alessi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7367ac3a368224b0000e7","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366963,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomaso Smith","original_name":"Tomaso Smith","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a73684925141307d0000f8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662784,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Angelo Besozzi","original_name":"Angelo Besozzi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a7369392514130c00000e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":570750,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cesare A.
