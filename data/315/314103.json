White Wolf, the son of the chief of another tribe, offers to buy Che-wee-na; when her father refuses, Little Wolf challenges Big Elk to a physical contest that Big Elk wins. Embittered, Little Wolf provokes a war between the tribes, abducting Che-wee-na while Big Elk and the other Great Bear warriors are away from their camp. Che-wee-na feigns insanity among Little Wolf's people, who think that she is in communication with the great spirits. She wins the gratitude of the tribe when she nurses a sick child to health, but in so doing incurs the jealousy of the tribe's medicine man, who accuses her of poisoning the tribe's water supply.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":"/gqJwIRJCJeDWH0fSyK3vCtA7w4j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northwestern Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the White Man Came","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Old Badger","original_name":"Old Badger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3ca9e70486380012eda276","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bird Tail","original_name":"Bird Tail","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3ca9ed0486380011ed9eb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bear Claw","original_name":"Bear Claw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3ca9f321621b000fef4271","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Old Coyote","original_name":"Mae Old Coyote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3ca9faede1b0617eeae572","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scratches His Face","original_name":"Scratches His Face","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3caa01a1d332000f0cc9ae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plain Feather","original_name":"Plain Feather","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3caa09a1d33200100cd76a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John E.
