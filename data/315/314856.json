Deep pillows and Alaskan spines, all filmed at night, with massive lights, custom made LED suits, and a national governments worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering. Filmed as a partnership between Sweetgrass Productions, Philips TV, and the Swedish Agency Ahlstrand & WÃ¥llgren, it's two parts creativity, one part branded content, and a pinch of masochism for good measure. Overall, it's an incredibly unique partnership between our vision of skiing and the color and light technology behind the Philips Ambilight TV.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":"/boRgloB7H7icWLgiDyrdc90FRdl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19469,"logo_path":"/9J7UPjnJ0AanK0BJLYKmikrVUS1.png","name":"Sweetgrass Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afterglow","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Waggoner","original_name":"Nick Waggoner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a68e90a0e0a260d61005380","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4129740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/boRgloB7H7icWLgiDyrdc90FRdl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
