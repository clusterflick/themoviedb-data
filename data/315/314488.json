The questions were about Carlos Antunes’ personal and political career, with a special interest in his involvement in the Revolutionary Brigades and the armed struggle against the dictatorship that led to his arrest in 1978. The untimely death of the writer, in the same year, left the questionnaire unanswered and some uncertainty as to its purpose. After almost 30 years, the director asks Carlos Antunes to answer the 13 questions and to reconstruct the achievements, illusions and sorrows of the Revolutionary Brigades in Portugal, in the years surrounding the Carnations’ Revolution in 1974.","popularity":0.1986,"poster_path":"/oenhfIrciPeofNH75HNJ77sau9K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Três Vinténs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2014-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outra Forma de Luta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Nascimento","original_name":"Francisco Nascimento","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/zLIdpKIpShG4WjVbZHXhdpp8FlD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d421569d8cc4a0016337001","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1732132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Félix Costa","original_name":"Dina Félix Costa","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/6seddX5QNM8X7kjkIHTijucbojF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5eccb5b119690c001e706402","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Silva","original_name":"Jorge Silva","popularity":0.0908,"profile_path":"/dps7kHCsvEaY5bTzBD5ABPHf41W.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5eccb5b8021cee00228a0667","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Melo","original_name":"Miguel Melo","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/qsnLTvOUGUyLp6MkqHUXrjVYSei.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5eccb5cb021cee002089d5ad","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"João Pinto Nogueira","original_name":"João Pinto Nogueira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6407f2f9d75bd600a2d4b670","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Pessoa","original_name":"Marta Pessoa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eccb57019690c001c702381","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048632,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rita Palma","original_name":"Rita Palma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eccb55c021cee00218a64b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1207354,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Inês Carvalho","original_name":"Inês Carvalho","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eccb7e4021cee00228a0868","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"João Pinto Nogueira","original_name":"João Pinto Nogueira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed04a9d96386400246df49e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4625508","wikidata_id":"Q22000329","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oenhfIrciPeofNH75HNJ77sau9K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OUTRA FORMA DE LUTA Cinema Ideal TRAILER","key":"123877336","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-01T19:41:24.000Z","id":"5eccb58119690c001d709f28"}]}}}
