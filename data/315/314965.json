In the Fabero coal mine, northern Spain, you can see a 520-tonne Hitachi EX5500 hydraulic excavator making light work of overburden. This beast feeds 200-tonne capacity Cat 789C trucks in just three or four passes. Nearby, a Komatsu D475A dozer – the biggest in Europe – is ripping through rock. In footage from mines associated with Fabero you will see other immense hydraulic excavators at work: Komatsu PC3000 and Hitachi EX3600. Among the many supporting machines on view are Komatsu WA800 and WA600 wheeled loaders.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The large, specialised machines in this programme have one task: to move mountains.","title":"Massive Earthmoving Machines Part 4: Mountain Movers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Vale","original_name":"Steven Vale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"54a41033c3a3682f1b012029","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
