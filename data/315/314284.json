McCandless' own letters, released for the first time, as well as new and surprising interviews, probe the mystery that still lies at the heart of a story that has become part of the American literary canon and compels so many to this day.","popularity":0.6227,"poster_path":"/g2JEEYUma0PJXWBxYJjoEARBQPP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25585,"logo_path":"/eyjGTfjzBlj0nK9JkOtYXh5rOQh.png","name":"Lincoln Square
