The documentary covers the current human rights and political situation of the Sahrawi. There are several interviews recorded with human rights victims including an elderly lady who had been attacked in her home the previous day by Moroccan security forces. There is also a focus given to the alleged vested interests of countries in the region, particularly France. The film states that the French Government's close relationship with Morocco, their trade deals and their use of veto over the terms of the UN mission in Western Sahara are major factors.","popularity":0.2771,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dancing Turtle Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Other Choice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Brown","original_name":"Dominic Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549ea8f7c3a3682f23008388","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Brown","original_name":"Dominic Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549ea8edc3a3682f1b007fde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1568,"name":"undercover"},{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":1629,"name":"morocco"},{"id":7041,"name":"sahara desert"},{"id":18034,"name":"desert"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":195405,"name":"indigenous community"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
