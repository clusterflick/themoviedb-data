Then a TV special from the 70's called \"The Weird World of Weird\" where host Ralph Story takes us on a guide through the world of the occult. Next is \"Follow That Skirt\", a short film from 1964 that follows a gender confused man as he strangles and slashes the women he hates. The compilation wraps up with some recently uncovered footage of \"The Smut Peddler\", a lost nudie-cutie from '65 that involves a pervy publisher and a bevy of nude models.","popularity":0.2386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42356,"logo_path":null,"name":"National General Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":42357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biolane","origin_country":""},{"id":42358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mohawk Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weird World Of Weird","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1229516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Story","original_name":"Ralph Story","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Host (The Weird World Of Weird)","credit_id":"54a09e4bc3a368764f007bba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Leeds","original_name":"Phil Leeds","popularity":0.4866,"profile_path":"/hcPPhwWl12wKYWHCwrKVURWugjn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosie the Dog (Rosie)","credit_id":"54a09eef9251414d2700660f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Taylor","original_name":"Charles Taylor","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kip (Rosie)","credit_id":"54a09f0c925141198b00011e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton LaVey","original_name":"Anton LaVey","popularity":0.2452,"profile_path":"/4ViP5lpbBOaHY1WPqbuAK8r8Beh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself (The Weird World Of Weird)","credit_id":"54a09f33c3a36855420087b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale West","original_name":"Dale West","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dale (Follow That Skirt)","credit_id":"54a0a0169251414e2800698a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.B.
