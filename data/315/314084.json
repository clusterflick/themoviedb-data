Separated, the two boys grow up very differently, one as Paul Marsden, the other as a cowboy named Three Word Brand. Paul becomes governor of Utah while Brand partners with George Barton in a ranch. The owner of the adjacent ranch plots to get Barton and Brand out of the way in order to control water rights. When Governor Marsden comes to the area to investigate, Brand sees the resemblance between them, though neither knows about his twin. Brand waylays Paul and takes his place as governor in an attempt to thwart the crooked rancher in the water rights scheme.","popularity":0.3076,"poster_path":"/uJa4s3EKnKbfTwNSFQ0CVK2XMgo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32484,"logo_path":null,"name":"William S.
