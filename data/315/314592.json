Passing on knowledge overturns the relationship between freedom and imprisonment. Using the right screw becomes a metaphor of re-building one’s own life. “The convicts’ workshop” is a place of freedom. If the retired man starts working again in a prison, then the convict can find a new meaning to his life outside by taking on a job.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/gLAOhgXnFXS8p4kqdynSCyeiqUt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meno male é lunedì","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1166718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Vendemmiati","original_name":"Filippo Vendemmiati","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a2c5ef925141236b0065a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLAOhgXnFXS8p4kqdynSCyeiqUt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1433}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
