We gain a unique insight into the whole business of being a successful contemporary artist in the highly lucrative but cutthroat contemporary art world. And we watch as he comes up with exciting new ideas in unexpected places and then brings them to fruition often on an industrial scale. The film is made in an intimate, hand held style by award-winning director Gerry Fox who has made previous films with the artist and so is able to question and prod him forcefully from behind the Canon 5-D camera.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marc Quinn - Making Waves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerry Fox","original_name":"Gerry Fox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a2bfd8c3a3682f2100f411","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4108610","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
