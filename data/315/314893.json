From their jungle headquarters just north of Singapore, Frank, Ali and a team of native helpers roam the area from Northern Johore to Perak in search of interesting wild animals, reptiles and birds. Hoping to find a tiger, Buck captures a monitor lizard and a black leopard, while another black leopard narrowly escapes an encounter with a giant python and then battles a bigger and stronger tiger. After trapping a spotted leopard, Frank adopts a baby honey bear and a baby elephant. The team catches an orangutan, but the tiger eludes their camouflaged pit. Meanwhile, Frank visits the \"bathing festival\" of a local tribe and watches as tribesmen kill an intruding spotted leopard with blow darts. The tiger then meets an enormous regal python, who has just crushed a crocodile, and fights to a draw with it.","popularity":0.3818,"poster_path":"/627GTuODnb1omCNnMuk0JwpNVg5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bring 'Em Back Alive","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Buck","original_name":"Frank Buck","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/7s1wHTfL7p6gRze5szeaJy8ZBfm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself and narrator","credit_id":"589edeeec3a3684bc400a977","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clyde E.
