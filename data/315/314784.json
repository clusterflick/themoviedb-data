A moody opera that is thematically broad at times and intimately personal in others, \"Khovanshchina\" tells the story of the 17th-century clash between Russian conservatives and Peter the Great's reformists. Among the singers is renowned basso Nicolai Ghiaurov and Paata Burchuladze, as well as Anatoly Kocherga, Ludmila Semtchuk, and Heinz Zednik.","popularity":0.1916,"poster_path":"/j8BSpBE6FQHDge4DxIplU4SbWYH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Staatsoper","origin_country":""},{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khovanshchina","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Abbado","original_name":"Claudio Abbado","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/v6zf1YHJ3gMAvQ5xmrTYkd4A12.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5793e2cb92514156e60023b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":113687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Atlantov","original_name":"Vladimir Atlantov","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prince Andrey Khovansky","credit_id":"5793e2d9c3a368457f00014a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paata Burchuladze","original_name":"Paata Burchuladze","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/AkuLoBieYUZKZNxELe4fe9NQtYU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dositheus","credit_id":"5793e2e6c3a36828a600d836","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoly Kocherga","original_name":"Anatoly Kocherga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Boyar Shaklovity","credit_id":"5793e2fb92514169c500bf10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Marusin","original_name":"Yuri Marusin","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Prince Vassily Golitsin","credit_id":"5793e3059251410d1200ec9f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludmila Semtschuk","original_name":"Ludmila Semtschuk","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marfa","credit_id":"5793e30fc3a36848120000d2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolai Ghiaurov","original_name":"Nicolai Ghiaurov","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/mqOIh6LYKBPon1gNouDTcvoxZzS.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Prince Ivan Khovansky","credit_id":"5cb776b00e0a266b93efacae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Zednik","original_name":"Heinz Zednik","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/hf5QZTk7fBTo0DL92leLA4wkBlQ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Scribe","credit_id":"5cb7771092514108d3f640b3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Poschner-Klebel","original_name":"Brigitte Poschner-Klebel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Susanna","credit_id":"5cb77731c3a3686aee84189c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"5793e2869251413dd2000064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","original_name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/80ysKl0MqarVD8G3gEEujncqIii.jpg","credit_id":"5793e2a3c3a368631c00c8c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351655,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Erich Wonder","original_name":"Erich Wonder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ihK9BPHy3ndZVyZBnD9xQZjPVOO.jpg","credit_id":"5cb77413c3a3686af9842819","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290655,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Joachim Herzog","original_name":"Joachim Herzog","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb7742bc3a3683abf81a235","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Kirchner","original_name":"Alfred Kirchner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb773f2c3a3686b07843eac","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290656,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bernd R.
