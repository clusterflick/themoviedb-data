In a personal collage consisting of the stories of members of her Slovak-Hungarian family and of visual references to historical events, she follows the eventful and today often taboo history of the post-war fate of Hungarians on Slovak soil. The abstract topic grabs our interest not only through the witnesses' testimony, but also by using thre novel technique of animating real objects, including a number of contemporary and modern photographs.","popularity":0.1465,"poster_path":"/cI1CxJTy9DsZSV0A99Dyydp6E6Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandala
