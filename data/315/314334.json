Its inhabitants, indigenous Sami people, live from the ancient tradition of reindeer husbandry. Once a year the reindeer herders are celebrated for their labors in a festival that features a reindeer sleigh race where they can display their skills. But the Kolkhoz is insolvent and it looks like the festival might have to be cancelled - a symbol of the Sami tradition and culture in Russia, currently threatened with extinction. 30 years old Sasha, a member of the newly found Sami parliament in Russia fights for the festival and the survival of her village.","popularity":0.1335,"poster_path":"/rsohrRQ2Ma6sv6asbtZkGHQlIhd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guardians of Tundra","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Сказка Тундры","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Harder","original_name":"René Harder","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61edbbc26d4c97004310f870","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Harder","original_name":"René Harder","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61edbbdc87f3f2001b37309f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475880,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anika Simon","original_name":"Anika Simon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61edbc12eb64f112efdb0e4e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3162596","wikidata_id":"Q20972671","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rsohrRQ2Ma6sv6asbtZkGHQlIhd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
