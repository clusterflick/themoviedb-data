Gustavo is a wild man living at a nostalgic place yearning for the lost essence of its past. Every night, Gethsemane becomes Gustavo's scene, while he slips into the dark corners of the neighborhood. This film is a contemplation of a shared impermanence, where Gethsemane's debris bears witness of the end of a community, but also of a human being.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing After The Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Hoyos","original_name":"Gustavo Hoyos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55b61c1c925141788b008ea1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406370,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juan Camilo Olmos Feris","original_name":"Juan Camilo Olmos Feris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a2c7ad9251411860001fcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406370,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juan Camilo Olmos Feris","original_name":"Juan Camilo Olmos Feris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b61c089251411e18015fd1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3839964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
