Michael already has one. A family. A perfectly normal wish and precisely because it is so easy, but not so easy to fulfill today. So what do you do when one partner wants a child and the other one maybe does or in fact doesn't? Split up? What does a child mean for a relationship? What does the wish and the urging do to a relationship? A relationship which works so easily, just as long as neither half really wants something. Sabine makes a decision and Michael can finally say what he feels.","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3/4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1406321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maike Mia Höhne","original_name":"Maike Mia Höhne","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a2b59cc3a3682f1e00eed4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
