Later on, more directors joined and so did actors, actresses and singers. This documentary follows the band members at home, on the set, at rehearsals and during performances. It’s a story of friendship, opposing characters, growing old and ambitions and illusions. Anecdotes and archive films provide a hilarious flashback on the lives of the film friends. Time has treated them well. Everybody is or has been successful. To rough it all up, they decide to write a song that will be played at one of the band member’s funeral.","popularity":0.2207,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Directors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ate de Jong","original_name":"Ate de Jong","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/7CccV2n5Xe1RtRRImezylYLPYZS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"54a3b38e92514121270080ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Maas","original_name":"Dick Maas","popularity":0.3571,"profile_path":"/tNVHmf93U9uL3PJyP09EVs7NEh1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"54a3b399c3a3680b2700f335","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Scheepmaker","original_name":"Hans Scheepmaker","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/Af0T2q94Dc8tDcZcrdw2gjKETXv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"54a3b3aa92514117dd003e5c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Warnier","original_name":"Peter Warnier","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"54a3b3b9c3a368764f00dfda","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Schouten","original_name":"George Schouten","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"54a3b3c8c3a3682f1b0113eb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huub Stapel","original_name":"Huub Stapel","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/Ar41d7m6EA9eHGc7sMYTligjA77.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"himself","credit_id":"54a3b3d492514117dd003e66","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esmé Lammers","original_name":"Esmé Lammers","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/2AI5GOKwdBXAh2fetRouqGvT6Ij.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"herself","credit_id":"54a3b3e69251414d2700bd46","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":146578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja van den Broecke","original_name":"Maja van den Broecke","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"herself","credit_id":"54a3b3f4c3a368554200ea43","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1068689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Klemann","original_name":"Monique Klemann","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/54G9mmwy2gWpG92rGmZDZGAnBol.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"herself","credit_id":"54a3b401925141198b005e15","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":995595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nouchka van Brakel","original_name":"Nouchka van Brakel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yAICPMyMSqsZw7BIh8iNdTkZOHE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"herself","credit_id":"54a3b410925141198b005e1c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Doornik","original_name":"Leslie Doornik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"54a3b41c92514118600042c7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1054631,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dorna van Rouveroy","original_name":"Dorna van Rouveroy","popularity":0.0978,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"54a3b427c3a3680b2700f33e","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Schouten","original_name":"George Schouten","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54a3b366c3a3682f1e011152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
