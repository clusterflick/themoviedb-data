The elderly lady's increasing forgetfulness prompts her son to suggest that she move into a nursing home. But then suddenly a crack opens up in one of the walls of her apartment, through which something enters Mrs. Pospisil's world that will change her life forever. Paul Ertl's highly efficient and picture-perfect The Crack is a psychologically underpinned mid-length horror miniature that transforms into a utopia as casual as it is original as it is gently disturbing, and is ultimately also a powerful plea for the autonomy of older people.","popularity":0.1306,"poster_path":"/xB6FrphRICBWReLEoJtM5q1j72E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73113,"logo_path":"/muxz73bzgGWez395FlXsHdDFLCd.png","name":"Filmakademie Wien","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berta Kammer","original_name":"Berta Kammer","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6337022a0f2fbd0079d659bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Hochmair","original_name":"Philipp Hochmair","popularity":0.3139,"profile_path":"/2nY333AmRI3Rz38km7wZ37BLPwf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6337024342f19f007de453c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Maria Marold","original_name":"Eva Maria Marold","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/qVTzC4E3NCRyo6FXkRcwBPHIQ0S.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63370258f3b49a007b819b81","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Schleinzer","original_name":"Markus Schleinzer","popularity":0.3265,"profile_path":"/af6foHxOaClxDKqBSKxMyV50C4W.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6337026cd363e5007a306ad9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Ortner","original_name":"Max Ortner","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66c095fec874dc5a8e9dc643","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4890843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Deckenbacher","original_name":"Johannes Deckenbacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66c0960d9dbdfa9d21deb2b7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3721905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Ertl","original_name":"Paul Ertl","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6337019fe9da6900795a5df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721906,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lukas Schöffel","original_name":"Lukas Schöffel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633701c3255dba00816a36bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Eckhart","original_name":"Paul Eckhart","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3arodp7APgl9c57RKlaW2VGDKb8.jpg","credit_id":"633701fb255dba007c7cb9cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3518436,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Marija Burtscher","original_name":"Marija Burtscher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c095ca18e6622adcd3253f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16088408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"der_riss_film","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xB6FrphRICBWReLEoJtM5q1j72E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
