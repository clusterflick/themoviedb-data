META MECANO is a poetic depiction of the genesis of this mono-graphic museum, from the builders' first plans and Mario Botta's designs to its construction and the assembly of Tinguely's fragile mobile sculptures. In interviews with Mario Botta, Tinguely's wife Niki de Saint Phalle, museum director Pontus Hultén and Tinguely himself, the film goes on to explore the mission of museums and of art in general today. META MECANO is a unique document on the significance of the artist Jean Tinguely and on the role that museums play in our day and age.","popularity":0.1011,"poster_path":"/7gDS50EdqSoMtGmJaVmqHhEEa3E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129841,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZAS Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1997-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meta-Mecano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruedi Gerber","original_name":"Ruedi Gerber","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/jOjN7AaBGX6QXU7JZMTEO66Csdh.jpg","credit_id":"6336a824db4ed6008eb93ac9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39826,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Lindenmaier","original_name":"Patrick Lindenmaier","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6336a838db4ed60084b92316","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972371,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dieter Lengacher","original_name":"Dieter Lengacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6336a85d0d11f2007acc0c0c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521647,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mirjam Krakenberger","original_name":"Mirjam Krakenberger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6336a849f8e98200903e46d1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruedi Gerber","original_name":"Ruedi Gerber","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/jOjN7AaBGX6QXU7JZMTEO66Csdh.jpg","credit_id":"6336a818255dba007c7c9545","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7gDS50EdqSoMtGmJaVmqHhEEa3E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival International du Film d'Art et Pédagogique FIFAP","release_date":"1997-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
