The girls have got married and have left for the villages. Boys are getting married in villages. It should be taught to children”.  — Gyani Maiya Sen-Kusunda  The Gi Mihaq (also known as Kusunda) was a semi-nomadic hunter and gatherer community that settled in villages around the mid-western Nepalese district of Dang. They have long lost their native language Mihaq (Kusunda), to acculturation and other barriers to active use. The community also lost their 83-year-old elder Gyani Maiya Sen-Kusunda in 2020, the most and the only known fluent Kusunda speaker then. Filmed in Kulmor in the Dang District in 2018, this openly-licensed documentary is a memoir of Sen-Kusunda in her own words and a biography of her people who were forced to leave their language and cultural identity. Kusunda is being revived by Kamala Sen Khatri, Sen-Kusunda’s younger sister, and Uday Raj Aaley, a local researcher who is the key interviewer for this film.","popularity":0.1833,"poster_path":"/yzCXxLcBRptMTpsF7wZu7HXvpI4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183314,"logo_path":null,"name":"O Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2019-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No community can express the pain of losing an elder, especially when one was presumed to be the last fluent speaker of their language and the language is nearing endangerment.","title":"Gyani Maiya","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","title":"ज्ञानी मैया","type":"Translation in Nepali"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyani Maiya Sen Kusunda","original_name":"Gyani Maiya Sen Kusunda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633717fdb076e5008354d08d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uday Raj Aaley","original_name":"Uday Raj Aaley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633718110d11f2007f50c0a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjib Chaudhary","original_name":"Sanjib Chaudhary","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63371824f3b49a007b81a195","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3722075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Subhashish Panigrahi","original_name":"Subhashish Panigrahi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6337185d0a517c009cd53c5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3722075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Subhashish Panigrahi","original_name":"Subhashish Panigrahi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6337184ed363e5007d88ea77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3722075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Subhashish Panigrahi","original_name":"Subhashish Panigrahi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c22e84cbe120079a34906","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12728670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9cXeGjIzV4cbEQuS33WtWzRzE7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yzCXxLcBRptMTpsF7wZu7HXvpI4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":485,"name":"nepal"},{"id":5996,"name":"language"},{"id":304158,"name":"kusunda"},{"id":304159,"name":"endangered language"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"Kusunda","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ne","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gyani Maiya - Trailer (2019 Documentary)","key":"SJBwk-42ihw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-30T16:30:56.000Z","id":"633719e26e0d72007b06c2ec"}]}}}
