Turning to social media, no one \"likes\", nor do they follow or even comment on his predicament. He calls the authorities, to no avail. Now completely obsessed, he becomes an activist and goes looking for acknowledgment, only to have doors slammed in his face. Even a public protest fails to elicit a whisper of sympathy; it's time to let go, so he buries his passion. Having shed the burden, our protagonist turns a new leaf - he decides to see if rejection can be turned around, made benevolent, and perhaps even grow into something that changes his life.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/wJKVODWYTbkHoehsbLqG4v3oIAO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notice of Rejection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Vander Meer","original_name":"Steven Vander Meer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"6338d9a42b113d0082d8f4a5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Vander Meer","original_name":"Steven Vander Meer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338d970006b01007dadb516","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Vander Meer","original_name":"Steven Vander Meer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338d9789512e100821a93cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ian Davidson","original_name":"Ian Davidson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338d989e8131d0091531e5f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wJKVODWYTbkHoehsbLqG4v3oIAO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Raindance Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
