Angered by the callousness of Rome, and frustrated by his own, near penniless condition, Micah vows, \"If I have to fight or steal to be rich...I'll do it!\"  Micah and Rachel experience a number of peculiar characters and unusual events on their journey, as they follow a brilliant star which beckons them to Bethlehem, where, they are convinced treasure awaits. Meanwhile in Jerusalem, His Highness Herod the Great is outraged and threatened by news from his chief astrologer that the bright star is a sign that a \"Messiah\" will be born.  As the drama of the story builds, Micah is faced with the most important decision of his life. Will he trade information as to the whereabouts of the \"Messiah\" baby, in exchange for the riches and gold he has longed for? Or, will he find a greater treasure?","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/85KC3hVDOPwyTpyZFZxZ69Ny8nu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Christian Broadcasting Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Micah's Christmas Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":110741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angela Ward Costello","original_name":"Angela Ward Costello","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63387a61501cf2008192bcc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Edwards","original_name":"Ben Edwards","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63387d9a0b5fd6007c996dd9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h80qOw4Lw5zRlpu7Ru7czjeP0MO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/85KC3hVDOPwyTpyZFZxZ69Ny8nu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":722}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"VHS","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"And DVD release too","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
