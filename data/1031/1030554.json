People along the route mostly depend on farming for their livelihoods, so at the same time, many people crippled and died with rotten feet. According to incomplete statistics, there are only more than 160 suspected germ warfare survivors in Quzhou, Zhejiang. This film focuses on these surviving elderly people. When 70 years have passed since the war and a new chapter of history opened, what kind of lives are the old people who are victims? What kind of mental state are you in? Will the wounds left over from the war heal? What is the attitude towards war?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gZW6CH6CmD77qRUUifTdcczqdoJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LIVE OF ROTTEN LIFE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cui Huang","original_name":"Cui Huang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633845fae8131d009152f62c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gZW6CH6CmD77qRUUifTdcczqdoJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":" 85min version(bilibili reshipped)","release_date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"60min version（xinpianchang.com）","release_date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"我还在——细菌战后的溃烂人生 Live Of Rotten Life (预告片 Trailer) (Huang Cui 黄翠, 2019)","key":"jbBUMgokCDA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-06T05:46:28.000Z","id":"66ece74827a9af9d0dadc0b9"}]}}}
