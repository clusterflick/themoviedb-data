Jack was a promising scholar until his dedication to prove the existence of extra-terrestrial life consumed him into a mundane, repetitive cycle. THE GAZER is the story of Jack. Jack owns a small alien jerky shop in the desert. Aside from the occasional lost tourist, and a lizard hanging around his shop, Jack finds himself completely isolated. After his repetitive daily pattern is mysteriously interrupted, Jack is reminded of the passion and hope he once had to prove the existence of extra terrestrial life. Set in the vein of Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of The Third Kind, E.T., and Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed, The Gazer has nods to classic '70s and 80's grounded sci-fi films with brief moments of hyper-realism.","popularity":0.3487,"poster_path":"/hvKKFcUju8tPrQ5RArLCtLZ7mAJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gazer","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Decker","original_name":"Joshua Decker","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"6580473d34e152084507deb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2430635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candice Marie Bennett","original_name":"Candice Marie Bennett","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/yynvbkf3ZQBu1A6xDKzwr5MbqWV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tourist","credit_id":"658047833a48c529dcaf677d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bianca Milhailov","original_name":"Bianca Milhailov","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tourist","credit_id":"6580479c2f8d0908f4a7fdd2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Meade","original_name":"Emily Meade","popularity":0.6623,"profile_path":"/vEXKBDYSIwtY1QtmX6RrwTIPBfE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jack's Sister","credit_id":"658047ae226c5608199e4bf7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleni Rivera","original_name":"Eleni Rivera","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580471834e152089f07909f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Spencer Drees","original_name":"Spencer Drees","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658046d3cedac408277d4ae3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleni Rivera","original_name":"Eleni Rivera","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658046faac617c08721527eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12991474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1517,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hvKKFcUju8tPrQ5RArLCtLZ7mAJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1023}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sci-Fi Short Film \"The Gazer\" | DUST | Online Premiere","key":"2wAHaF_z6Xw","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2022-06-20T16:00:01.000Z","id":"63397ec087f3f2007a2f9ec0"}]}}}
