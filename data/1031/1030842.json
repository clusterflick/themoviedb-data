The story of this \"exceptional\" character is intimately linked to that of the rescue of the two German mountaineers on the west face of the Drus, in 1966, a rescue which he had took the initiative. While the official emergency services of the EHM try to reach them from above, a pirate rope made up of Gary Hemming, René Desmaison, Lothar Mauch, Gil Bodin, Mike Brurke, François Guillot, the filmmaker Gérard Bauer organizes to join them from below and succeeded after a fierce struggle the rescue. The press seizes the event and elevates Gary Hemming to the rank of national hero. All the newspapers feature this big guy with a cool attitude, mismatched clothes, jovial smile and long blond hair on the front page. From then on, he was nicknamed: \"the beatnik of the peaks\".","popularity":0.4697,"poster_path":"/iGVkRYcmNNN6AvWMjn2ntGyPBic.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2668,"logo_path":"/wXmehIpEfAaJk7eU6GpBERpK3m1.png","name":"MC4","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France
