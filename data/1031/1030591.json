There, he meets Ju-yeon  whom Jae-ho knew before but has not thought of for 15 years. Jae-ho came to the cyber world with high hopes but is having a hard time adjusting. Ju-yeon teaches him the laws, the rules, and the living customs of cyber world. In the process, Jae-ho and Ju-yeon go beyond the everyday talk to discover an important memory that has been pushed out. Curiously, it was a file that was drifting in the sea of the cyber world. It was also Jae-ho himself as well as something to be avoided.​","popularity":0.0942,"poster_path":"/bVZdEMvog7rbrK1GGIhiQk1wM8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theater of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Eung-soo","original_name":"Kim Eung-soo","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63385d9b4cbe12007c39406d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/bVZdEMvog7rbrK1GGIhiQk1wM8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
