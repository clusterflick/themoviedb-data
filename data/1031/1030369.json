Black Daddy: The Movie is a passion project covering a space that is near to our hearts; black fatherhood. I followed the lives of a few like-minded men as they told compelling stories of the joy, pain and the complexity of what it means to be a black father in America.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Daddy: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damon Jamal Taylor","original_name":"Damon Jamal Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6337715e4f33ad0082cd81d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
