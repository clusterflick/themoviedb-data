Revered as a right-wing powerbroker, Stone's influential journey traces back to the era of President Nixon, a legacy inked onto his own back. In a film marked by unparalleled access, Christoffer Guldbrandsen captures the tumultuous final months of the Trump administration, centering on the heart of power and climaxing with the unprecedented storming of Congress.  Guldbrandsen finds himself amidst the chaos as Trump supporters converge on Washington, witnessing firsthand Roger Stone's strategic retreat from his hotel suite as the 'Stop the Steal' campaign spirals into a riot. A Storm Foretold â€“ Roger Stone and Die unfolds the narrative of a once-established political party metamorphosing into an anti-democratic movement, where impassioned rhetoric evolves into tangible violence.","popularity":0.2412,"poster_path":"/f9HNKlQZrI6IDvdVPE4YpyfeEYl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51394,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guldbrandsen Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The American Rebellion","title":"A Storm Foretold","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"En varslet storm","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoffer Guldbrandsen","original_name":"Christoffer Guldbrandsen","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":72,"character":"Self - Journalist","credit_id":"64861c7199259c011c40cc5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1600270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Stone","original_name":"Roger Stone","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/8VQxsyxmmWZZmu2wttxv7HNsm7t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6336d67ce9da690090fd4f24","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Trump","original_name":"Donald Trump","popularity":1.675,"profile_path":"/nkQrZELEgxsvwDSlYkNfpFmsFx4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self - President of the United States (archive footage)","credit_id":"6428bca201b1ca00d5e7f4fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex E.
