Most of their ancestors were forced to flee during the Japanese occupation / annexation (1910-1945). The name they gave themselves is Koryo-saram. Their language, Koryo-mar, is descended from the Hamgy√∂ng dialect (province of North Korea) and many other variants of Northeast Korean. The documentary sets up a multi-voice narrative characterized by shamanic rituals, digital glitches, voiceovers, texts and sound panoramas. At the same time inter-subjective and deeply personal, the film recounts migration, the diaspora and death with humor and lightness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bRgUFqQrxV2nzr0vhHpjS1IQN0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K-Saram: Tale of the Pig Head","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bRgUFqQrxV2nzr0vhHpjS1IQN0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
