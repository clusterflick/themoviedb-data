Gilbert decides to kill himself and heads to the mall to buy rope. While there, he discovers how expensive it is to take a picture with the mall Santa and decides on one last act of goodwill — dressing up like Santa himself and offering poor families (“with only one car”) the opportunity to take a picture with him for free. His suicide plans are delayed even further when he’s propositioned mysteriously by an odd fellow to come to his home and help out his wife.","popularity":0.4312,"poster_path":"/jXa3l0S3ZDbNFYPL3HFyh5Zenzu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gilbert refuses to have a sad Christmas this year.","title":"Gilbert's Little Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Budd Diaz","original_name":"Budd Diaz","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/69LXThMqArgdIOMP4ETaK13FQvu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gilbert","credit_id":"633778ea6728a8007a212452","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1232640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Rosen","original_name":"Andrea Rosen","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/b7rVDcERhUWpDfby0rpv8UIVmhp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Andrea","credit_id":"6337790042d8a5007a1666b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":986445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Ames","original_name":"Lindsay Ames","popularity":0.1552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lindsay","credit_id":"63377917ec370c007925aa68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Rietschel","original_name":"Chad Rietschel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gilbert (VO)","credit_id":"63377933e8131d009152a7f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1293988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Freund","original_name":"Kate Freund","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":"/wBss3zoS2R5CiaHP1j9WhuenUXA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"6337794887f3f2007f2deb9a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Kavutskiy","original_name":"Alex Kavutskiy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/zLHmhaXP8M2sKOJmYSHjBd22JCP.jpg","credit_id":"63377978944a57007c413a1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Kavutskiy","original_name":"Alex Kavutskiy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/zLHmhaXP8M2sKOJmYSHjBd22JCP.jpg","credit_id":"6337796de8131d009152a805","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jXa3l0S3ZDbNFYPL3HFyh5Zenzu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
