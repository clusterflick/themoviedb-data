IRANIAN LIVES MATTER is an experimental documentary, an audio-visual endurance test that audibly takes its audience through the chaos in the streets of Iran as the brutal regime cracks down on Iranian protesters, while visually showing the hands of the dictatorship as it crosses out 1500 lives one by one to further emphasize the scale of the massacre and show to a world desensitized to news of mass killings in the Middle East what the term \"1500 dead\" truly means.","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/1BQoB5TkXZnrB82Nng1v8lesg8F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Have you ever counted from 1 to 1500?","title":"Iranian Lives Matter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"An Iranian","original_name":"An Iranian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65590ec322931a011c96da7f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"An Iranian","original_name":"An Iranian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63379e8aa3b5e6007d8a42ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zJ2NHlsU9rcWHZhlXnRC7HbX60U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1BQoB5TkXZnrB82Nng1v8lesg8F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Flickfair On-Demand Film Festival","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IRANIAN LIVES MATTER","key":"yixq7rvSTyI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-30T23:33:32.000Z","id":"63379e3da2e602007d0182d6"}]}}}
