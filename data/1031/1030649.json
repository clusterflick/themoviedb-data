From the observation of them and of those who populate them there arise installations about encounters, identity and territoriality. The Brazilian-born Dias met the Swiss Riedweg in 1993. Together they learned that they could boost one another’s ideas. “This marriage became Mau Wal,” says Dias. In this documentary, they present their works and the many characters behind them: people who make day-to-day living in the big cities. Street vendors at a Northeast Brazilian fair in São Paulo, illegal immigrants in their quest for the European dream, street kids and their memories. In stories or in the role it plays, the human element is always a centerpiece to the duo’s work.","popularity":0.298,"poster_path":"/dX1gQjdNAepktHuHebmtIzHuGuY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MAU WAL - Translated Encounters","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurício Dias","original_name":"Maurício Dias","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"6338774e944a57008425d9a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Riedweg","original_name":"Walter Riedweg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"6338775d960cde00820aedc2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco del Fiol","original_name":"Marco del Fiol","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2dJDL7lXmTVT46sYJEdlYIXBdxF.jpg","credit_id":"6338777c944a57008e125adf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fabiana Werneck Barcinski","original_name":"Fabiana Werneck Barcinski","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633877900b5fd6007c996c52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fabiana Werneck Barcinski","original_name":"Fabiana Werneck Barcinski","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633877d3e8131d007d186e47","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco del Fiol","original_name":"Marco del Fiol","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2dJDL7lXmTVT46sYJEdlYIXBdxF.jpg","credit_id":"633877e3c2ff3d007ad52708","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Solange Farkas","original_name":"Solange Farkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633878244f33ad0082cdde77","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0768801","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dX1gQjdNAepktHuHebmtIzHuGuY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":304230,"name":"site specific"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer VCA - Mau Wal","key":"D98-dXEUa9w","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2007-06-12T20:46:26.000Z","id":"633876cb4f33ad0082cdde29"}]}}}
