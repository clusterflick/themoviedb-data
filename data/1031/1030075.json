In this film, Tuan Andrew Nguyen juxtaposes archival footage from the US army with recently recorded images of an unexploded ordnance (UXO) deactivation in the Vietnamese coastal province of Quảng Trị. The province is one of the main UXO hotspots in the Mekong region, with 8,540 casualties and 3,431 deaths recorded since the end of the Vietnam War. More widely, it is estimated that UXO explosions have caused 40,000 deaths in Vietnam; 29,000 in Laos, of which 40% are believed to be children; and more than 64,000 in Cambodia since the end of the war.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/5RiJEUKxytc4nRVRobcjgoxDDcJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary (TBA21)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sounds of Cannons Familiar Like Sad Refrains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","title":"Đại Bác Nghe Quen Như Câu Dạo Buồn","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721341,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nguyễn Xuân Phương","original_name":"Nguyễn Xuân Phương","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633655a9cba36f00816e3ece","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tuan Andrew Nguyen","original_name":"Tuan Andrew Nguyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/p3S56iUcMSF2Qw85BVbapJhpqhN.jpg","credit_id":"6336561007faa2007d3f5984","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tuan Andrew Nguyen","original_name":"Tuan Andrew Nguyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/p3S56iUcMSF2Qw85BVbapJhpqhN.jpg","credit_id":"633657316e0d720083d6036b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2557541,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trịnh Công Sơn","original_name":"Trịnh Công Sơn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1iwigxfpa4VFIodMSyti8IxzGT0.jpg","credit_id":"659fb93e3cd12c012af05ec5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khanh Ly","original_name":"Khanh Ly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659fb95784448e012710caaa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1cN78gSTDVrABfqjymVEVboD32t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RiJEUKxytc4nRVRobcjgoxDDcJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Commissioned by Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary for st_age","release_date":"2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
