Sig suffers from memory loss, while Guti recalls a fight with skinheads Sid drunkenly participated in and Guti tried peacefully to intervene in. Sig has no passport or any clue about his identity—the skinheads have taken everything he owned. Guti is trying to build a new home for himself on a river raft after losing his house to the bank and his life to his ex-wife. He introduces Sig to his friends—suburban misfits, who remind Sig of a legend of the hidden people.","popularity":0.3211,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23084,"logo_path":"/9mcikqGo4XjxS5t1w97FIoYeD0C.png","name":"Vertigo","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Post
