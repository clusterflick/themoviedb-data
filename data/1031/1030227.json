While the window is open and slowly twirls the curtains of the room, a young woman is laying in bed and with a glassy gaze seems to look into nothingness, lost in her thoughts, more and more convinced of what she is about to do. When she regains control of her body, she gets up and goes to the window. In the seconds before her fall, a vision of her in a dream becomes real: the woman relives the encounter with her inner demon, the personification of that suffering that is causing her to commit suicide.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/AkwYBfxkVCSlEEhQQeVDuUUTt6N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dafne Is Gone","title":"Dafne Is Gone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Gun","original_name":"Julie Gun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63402661b4a54300822713ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marek Jason Isleib","original_name":"Marek Jason Isleib","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63402666ddd52d007c96ee06","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3721868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Gun","original_name":"Julie Gun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6340260ab4a543007a0449fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730676,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stefano Memeli","original_name":"Stefano Memeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634026372f3b17007c78996b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eleonora Castello","original_name":"Eleonora Castello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634026410859b40081395622","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3730679,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Gonnella","original_name":"Marco Gonnella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634026500859b40081395633","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"dafneisgone","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AkwYBfxkVCSlEEhQQeVDuUUTt6N.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
