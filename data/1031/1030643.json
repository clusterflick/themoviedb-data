In a radically new production The Human Voice presents a flip of gender, and a metaphor of global pandemic. Now in English, Isaiah Bell sings to his male lover, and into the abyss of COVID. In a Zoom call impaired by lag and freeze and dropped signals, technology is once again enemy to intimacy. The agony of failed love is heightened by the necessity of distance, by the anaesthetic of the machine.","popularity":0.118,"poster_path":"/wsVMA66jIgMCvtaWp9jtxYqT28o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183389,"logo_path":null,"name":"City Opera Vancouver","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Voice: A Story for Our Times","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaiah Bell","original_name":"Isaiah Bell","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/moWPsgCUhLtqArGldGyI1onQocK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"633873941750510084c3dfb9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","credit_id":"633873ade194b0007d5ff316","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2354952,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Smith","original_name":"Andrew Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63387411960cde007acdc937","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaiah Bell","original_name":"Isaiah Bell","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/moWPsgCUhLtqArGldGyI1onQocK.jpg","credit_id":"633873dce194b0007a015735","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3147938,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Randle","original_name":"Chris Randle","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633873f0501cf2008192bb09","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569677,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francis Poulenc","original_name":"Francis Poulenc","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633873bf944a57008425d890","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3147938,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Randle","original_name":"Chris Randle","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633873fd960cde007acdc92d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wsVMA66jIgMCvtaWp9jtxYqT28o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
