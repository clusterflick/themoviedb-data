Shlomo's journey within Israel takes a sharp turn after he locates Interpol fugitive Anibal Teodoro Gauto, suspected of being one of Samuel’s murderers. Shlomo decides to fight for Gauto’s extradition to Argentina for trial. To his surprise, he meets fierce opposition from the state, determined to keep Gauto protected and prevent the unveiling of dark secrets from the past. Tomer Slutzky, Shlomo’s son, follows his father’s fight for justice against this alleged murderer of his cousin. What began as a father and son's discovery of a family secret turns into an investigative drama and public affair both in Israel and Argentina.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eV1X4juUVnJgIHnY0wRdwwNhGPo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fury","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shlomo Slutzky","original_name":"Shlomo Slutzky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633854ff0b5fd6007c996379","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomer Slutzky","original_name":"Tomer Slutzky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338550be8131d007d1865b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orit Ofir Ronell","original_name":"Orit Ofir Ronell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633855262b113d007fb392ee","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374382,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Malen Azzam","original_name":"Malen Azzam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637f07d9a4af8f00ca09c725","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shlomo Slutzky","original_name":"Shlomo Slutzky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637f07e06e938a00840446e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomer Slutzky","original_name":"Tomer Slutzky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc7f57d67d7dc3c86babec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eV1X4juUVnJgIHnY0wRdwwNhGPo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw IFF","release_date":"2022-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
