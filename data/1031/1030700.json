Mollusca & The Pelvic Floor loosely narrates Baga’s increasingly intimate relationship with Mollusca—the name and prompt Baga has given to the virtual assistant more commonly known as Alexa. Baga’s entanglement with Mollusca eventually becomes embodiment, narrated by descriptions of metamorphosis and inter-species contact from Octavia Butler’s Imago, Dan Brown’s Origin, and Michael Chrichton’s Sphere. Orchestrated between two projectors, which spill across the gallery floor, the video’s wild shifts in narrative scope are compounded by the elastic space Baga achieves with 3D video and layered audio.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nDg6ehmSoG0Czc7qH2XlTlltah8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mollusca & The Pelvic Floor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trisha Baga","original_name":"Trisha Baga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63389fd5c2ff3d007d93b1cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monkey","original_name":"Monkey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63389fe141a5610082e10664","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3723449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trisha Baga","original_name":"Trisha Baga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63389fc1175051008e16b8df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pOBMaSb7yHGJFUgNBENQobsZ2WR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nDg6ehmSoG0Czc7qH2XlTlltah8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
