This unique documentary edit, which combines authentic eyewitness accounts of historic events with little-known archival footage, examines various fates and places as well as the journeys associated with them. The resulting amalgam of images, speeches, and music/sound files is far from your typical historical illustration. A suggestive portrayal of life under bleak conditions, far away from home and on the cusp of death, unfolds before our very eyes.","popularity":0.2606,"poster_path":"/9ogUl6Ge4LzkVmsl7V88qd0Od9j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2022-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Old Czechs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Foukal","original_name":"Jan Foukal","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Pilots (voice)","credit_id":"633aee76cfe48f0092db2845","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2396616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miloslav Pecháček","original_name":"Miloslav Pecháček","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Pilots (voice)","credit_id":"633aee84c2ff3d007ad5eba1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Ptáčková","original_name":"Petra Ptáčková","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338b04e87f3f2007f2e4faa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2022146,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Václav Flegl","original_name":"Václav Flegl","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338b0791750510084c3ec40","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2315908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Šimon Špidla","original_name":"Šimon Špidla","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338b064ab1bc70079c703ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomáš Bojar","original_name":"Tomáš Bojar","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/Argn5HUSXrJjuuSx2OCMAPtPl8r.jpg","credit_id":"6338afe1e194b0009198dbd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomáš Bojar","original_name":"Tomáš Bojar","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/Argn5HUSXrJjuuSx2OCMAPtPl8r.jpg","credit_id":"6338afef944a57008425e71b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":81109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Soukup","original_name":"Peter Soukup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6338b03d2b113d007fb3a886","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Gebert","original_name":"Jan Gebert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633aee5c481382009188b386","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Lovitt","original_name":"Gordon Lovitt","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633aee2842d837007d5b8c76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21439102","wikidata_id":"Q113362708","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iNzXA7ZDfaZXpJe28haWNfoMH99.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1470},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mYmXCB79lSdkp7ucnOq7OTYYF9B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1470}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/9ogUl6Ge4LzkVmsl7V88qd0Od9j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
