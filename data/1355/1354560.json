The march was an unexpected success, with hundreds of gays and transgender people coming from every part of Italy. They paraded openly and the city was partly friendly and partly hostile. This documentary features personal memories and political comments from the past to the present. Using images of contemporary society and exclusive archival material, twelve people, participants and organizers, recall how that historic day was created, its relevance and consequences for their own lives and for the gay community as a whole.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pisa 1979-2009: The First Gay Parade 30 Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilina Aschi","original_name":"Marilina Aschi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df43fc6b244965206d5401","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciro Cascina","original_name":"Ciro Cascina","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df440d7b7dacb5c349c02f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano D'Agnese","original_name":"Stefano D'Agnese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df442bf13eea5e6578a31a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Chiti","original_name":"Alessandro Chiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df443e23c3761aeef62756","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Fadda","original_name":"Giuseppe Fadda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df444e1d61a544c0346d5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Lambertini","original_name":"Paolo Lambertini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df445c01679e42c09ac4cf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigi Malaroda","original_name":"Gigi Malaroda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df446904f62a0e6449be13","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2336094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Porpora Marcasciano","original_name":"Porpora Marcasciano","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/sqgqHImk2NIMGhOBWJUXLkITJyZ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df44784e114cab52c26904","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Pellegrini","original_name":"Sergio Pellegrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df4488d49a1f5c683471f9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Pini","original_name":"Andrea Pini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df44961f2fd04e0a9ac561","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massimo Russo","original_name":"Massimo Russo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df44a5400c5c39e99ac4a7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4567710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Taccarelli","original_name":"Valérie Taccarelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"self","credit_id":"66df44c3d49a1f5c683471fd","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Comitato Pisa '79","original_name":"Comitato Pisa '79","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df43daa88e97670d9e06f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
