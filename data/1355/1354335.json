Juliet: A Revenge Comedy is an award-winning, fast-paced, action-adventure comedy that follows Juliet on the literary adventure of a lifetime!  Stuck in an endless loop of turning a dagger on herself, Juliet (played by Lili Beaudoin) tears herself from the fabric of her tragedy in search of a reason for her untimely demise. On the way, Juliet recruits a team of the Bard’s most famous female characters (all played by Jessie Award-winner Carly Pokoradi) to find out why they’ve been forced to die! Together, they embark on an uproarious adventure through the canon, pursued by Shakespeare himself (played by Ryan Gladstone). Can they alter their fate, or are they doomed to play out the same tragic tales for the rest of eternity?  Filmed in February 2024 at The Cultch’s Historic Theatre on Musqueam, Squamish and Tseil-Waututh territory/Vancouver.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":"/nMEkutDipElMWn8pXUp7pkccYxy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yes","title":"Juliet: A Revenge Comedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Beaudoin","original_name":"Lili Beaudoin","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/sIOIpTywfYqZwrMKHDhyBvrjm6H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Juliet","credit_id":"66deb522b70cc7f6fd78a222","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4932244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carly Pokoradi","original_name":"Carly Pokoradi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Everyone Else","credit_id":"66deb53587f2936e3ec2630d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4932243,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pippa Mackie","original_name":"Pippa Mackie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66deb4f46e465c5781789c5f","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4337161,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ryan Gladstone","original_name":"Ryan Gladstone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66deb507c681de7e4b4c2ba5","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nMEkutDipElMWn8pXUp7pkccYxy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
