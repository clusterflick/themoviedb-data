Tropical Vulture is an experimental narrative video, co-directed by both artists, and blends Hollywood glamour and drama with an all-too-real life approach, which creates and inspires a counterpoint of unattainable desire against unbearable actuality. The video, shot on location in Acapulco, utilizes a “lo-fi” aesthetic and playful use of nonprofessional actors. Tropical Vulture is entrenched in corruption, tourism, and post-colonialism and it uses a loose narrative to create a portrait of a relationship between student and teacher.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/sBbBOIc9XVSpaW6KqpgI4VnaHYx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tropical
