We randomly pick an object and explore all the possibilities it holds. This is how a pen can become a spaceship, a flute, an earring, a telescope, a car lever. However, how does this game function when, everywhere you turn towards, there’s a wall? How do you play this game when, despite the desire to see beyond the wall, you shouldn’t? Such a wall must be seen as what it is; transforming it into a poetic and imaginative possibility equals silencing and making invisible its reality. Because this wall, like many others, should not exist.” –Stéphanie Janaina","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VER EL MAR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4931798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphanie Janaina","original_name":"Stéphanie Janaina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66de3bc4c1089222ebec7885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
