It chronicles an actual voyage, bringing to life the majesty of the ocean and the exotic places that such an endeavor touches. Bob, Sandra, sons Stephen and Dwayne, and daughter Susan departed San Diego, Ca. on their sailing ketch Sea Witch, stopping first in Hawaii. Their voyage continues through the tropical islands of the South Pacific, Australia, sailing the Torres Straits to Bali and across the Indian Ocean to Africa. They voyaged on across the South Atlantic stopping at St Helena and islands off the coast of Brazil before sailing on through the Caribbean, Panama Canal, and finally back to San Diego. The dvd depicts robust blue water sailing, secluded anchorages, and interesting native cultures encountered along the way. Blue Water Odyssey is an extremely well done video which leaves the viewer wanting to cast off and follow in their wake.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":"/n1sMmcobtwHujVVLo2cmO7e0wnR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Water Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert G.
