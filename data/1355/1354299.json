The first excerpt looks at McCahon's beginnings in Timaru and Dunedin, and his explorations of modernist techniques in paintings that reconceived 'the promised land' in an endemic landscape. The second excerpt covers McCahon's time in Muriwai in the 60s and 70s, and the influence of the environment and MƒÅori spirituality on his work. Sam Neill reads from McCahon's letters and writings. Directed by Paul Swadel, it won Best Documentary at the 2005 Qantas Awards.","popularity":0.3452,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":295,"logo_path":"/24lAsHZaGi4GzNrWzlkK60HLMBx.png","name":"NZ on
