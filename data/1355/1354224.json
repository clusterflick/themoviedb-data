Brimming with yearning, Mabel returns home, only to confront a whirlwind of emotions as old wounds are reopened. Her mother's perception of her absence adds to the complexity, leading to Mabel's heartfelt confession of her troubled past, marked by addiction and turmoil, as an immigrant in San Francisco. Offering intimate access to the artist and her vibrant photo paintings of the family, the documentary gives audiences a slice of life that challenges the prevailing narrative of “good immigrant” versus “bad immigrant.”","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/o1RELmt1BAygzC9SXerfTcTvMmf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prodigal Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4040245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mabel Valdiviezo","original_name":"Mabel Valdiviezo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66de30c4b15aad7807b94453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25389786","wikidata_id":"Q130288513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o1RELmt1BAygzC9SXerfTcTvMmf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3zHmymqm4A4GDHKihiKO7bpnvG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinefest Latino Boston","release_date":"2024-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
