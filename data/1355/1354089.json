A story about a wonderful human who enthused others with their unique personality, charisma and witty sense of humor. The audience loved Kim, and for them, the star wanted to be - as they stated themself - someone from another planet, a unicorn. The film is a laid-back impression about “the queen of Warsaw”, a snippet of their life, finally - a tribute to Kim Lee. We see the artist in a dressing room where they show us innumerable outfits, on a stage, during rehearsals, on the street. It is a unique occasion to see archival footage from their 18-year career and learn about the transformative power of drag.","popularity":0.1401,"poster_path":"/c3fwgcfwENQ0cViJXvijtKrGTNR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unicorn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Lee","original_name":"Kim Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66ddd4fc35f9a5e617b94541","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Bogdańska","original_name":"Marta Bogdańska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ddd4897ec73e907e499675","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Teryaki","original_name":"Maya Teryaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ddd4917542731bcb3451f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Bogdańska","original_name":"Marta Bogdańska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ddd4bd84d6ce4e2484c0c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4930975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Teryaki","original_name":"Maya Teryaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ddd4c4d9cf1123a9f5fe5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Bogdańska","original_name":"Marta Bogdańska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ddd4cc6540893c55499a10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/c3fwgcfwENQ0cViJXvijtKrGTNR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
