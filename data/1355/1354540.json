But the libretto is condemned and the score lost – possibly reworked here and there in later compositions. Claus Guth and Raphaël Pichon, haunted by this interesting project that had turned into one of the most intriguing failures in operatic history, have tried, not to recreate the letter, but to revive the spirit: to marry a strong, noble libretto with the most eloquent music. Supporting Jarrett Ott, Jacquelyn Stucker and Lea Desandre in the principal roles, the Pygmalion chorus and orchestra become important actors in a fresco that is both sublime and astonishingly modern.","popularity":0.0619,"poster_path":"/p3aA6GmbmIWmqTvJD6C7HuCJHQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Festival d'Aix-en-Provence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aix-en-Provence 2024","title":"Samson","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarett Ott","original_name":"Jarett Ott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yXlMePjrwYxUBNAEr6CbecEBew1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Samson","credit_id":"66df39543af2040dc19ac3ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquelyn Stucker","original_name":"Jacquelyn Stucker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dalila","credit_id":"66df3969035745e7de04686c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2157586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea Desandre","original_name":"Lea Desandre","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/clx6mN9SwSINodSJGwv313fbPKx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Timna","credit_id":"66df3985bc23ee51fc046a18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahuel Di Pierro","original_name":"Nahuel Di Pierro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kJz1r1Enm3hUSUnYkC8EuPQ42Jx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Achisch","credit_id":"66df39989a9ff1186f72e3af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4864126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Kilsby","original_name":"Laurence Kilsby","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/x6Soytdd0LQfcM1Mw4508hf4T84.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elon","credit_id":"66df39a7f13eea5e6578a292","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2157583,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raphaël Pichon","original_name":"Raphaël Pichon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"66df39c4c681de7e4b4c30bb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Philippe Rameau","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Rameau","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df39f675a76168bc3adff8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Guth","original_name":"Claus Guth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66df3a10c4812daab29ac88a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2213,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3aA6GmbmIWmqTvJD6C7HuCJHQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
