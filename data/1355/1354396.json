Umar performs the bride expected to display her beauty and wealth while\r choreographing the newlyweds journey from courtship onwards. Talitin, meaning \"third\" in Arabio, alludes to a local insult - being \"the third of the girls\" - targeted at boys interested in so-called womanly activities. Through its wearables, fabrics,\r and braids, the artist reclaims a pratice that he witnessed first hand from the women in his family - until his exclusion once he reached puberty. The songs played are a praise to the bride's family\r and also the soundscape for her to showcase her new curves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talitin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4932433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Umar","original_name":"Ahmed Umar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Third","credit_id":"66dee3d55fbfd9c48878a347","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4932433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Umar","original_name":"Ahmed Umar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dee3c375a76168bc3adcdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
