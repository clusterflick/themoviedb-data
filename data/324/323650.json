Arriving at the overcrowded work camp, the mother and other women who are not considered strong enough to be labourers, must journey still farther, crossing the icy Siberian landscape in search of food and shelter. At the same time, the daughter escapes the orphanage and returns to her former home, where she finds that a KGB officer has taken up residence. He protects her and an uneasy rapport between them develops—one of abhorrence and attraction, need and suspicion.","popularity":0.2674,"poster_path":"/53SffdD33JjajllryZC15Y5Uord.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lileo
