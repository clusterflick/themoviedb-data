But there is no gold to be found in Gaisbach. The newcomers are met with great hostility by the village population and can only find refuge in a barracks camp in the forest, where like-minded migrant workers wash gold in the rivers. Jakob finds employment with the beautiful Katharina Radacher, whose family used to dominate the gold mining industry in the region. He falls in love with Katharina, who is fighting against ruin and is forced to sell her mining rights by the corrupt mining councillor Hubert von Feileis. When Feileis realises that Jakob is standing in the way of his negotiations with Katharina, he has him chased out of the village in a devious manner.","popularity":0.2668,"poster_path":"/fOYbcmueRaR1UwsszoleEyL1GDd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tauerngold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Koch","original_name":"Sebastian Koch","popularity":0.4597,"profile_path":"/4YFk0qauux4jn68mvIfd5EEtG2v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jakob Hirzbacher","credit_id":"54d155b19251411b62000013","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aglaia Szyszkowitz","original_name":"Aglaia Szyszkowitz","popularity":0.2227,"profile_path":"/8Jju93UvSPszRzZ9Glvjp9z2anF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Katharina Radacher","credit_id":"54d155bdc3a368308000001a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Karl","original_name":"Fritz Karl","popularity":0.3064,"profile_path":"/jvkg9ugmuCjAM4OOQyEmIeiVWn1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hubert von Feileis","credit_id":"54d155cbc3a368308000001c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz Burger","original_name":"Götz Burger","popularity":0.2384,"profile_path":"/x9D0LiASjrS9ADO6pOD0iPlcux6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Moser","credit_id":"54d155ec9251411b59000032","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Wyprächtiger","original_name":"Hans Wyprächtiger","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/bZPzRu3g8JLz5ioMIx5UaILc7ZV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Radacher","credit_id":"54d155fd9251411b6200001a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":591949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina White","original_name":"Sabrina White","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/ebYcXBsvD0nR8DldAczZdUpYz03.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marcia","credit_id":"556dc70092514167e700041a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":38904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rüdiger Nüchtern","original_name":"Rüdiger Nüchtern","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d155a09251411b65000019","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0330970","wikidata_id":"Q2396823","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":808,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bPAEUqwVY7ReSc6aBpkDQIGErJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/fOYbcmueRaR1UwsszoleEyL1GDd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
