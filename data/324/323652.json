To answer this question, the documentary Galáxias tells stories of people from different places in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas, Pernambuco, Amazonas and Distrito Federal - who, on their own initiative, created libraries open to the public in their communities. In parallel to the narrative of these characters, Galáxias travels through several countries listening to intellectuals and ordinary people, seeking to discover what makes a person love a book.  What is the power of literature? In what lies the pleasure of reading? What changes will technological advances bring to the book? Galáxias: a reflection on this small, transcendent object and on the people who love books.","popularity":0.1182,"poster_path":"/371QHNwofYEv0c7BE5mTnMq1dxr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34630,"logo_path":"/lKKe99vus0EbdBoMunQMm8olFVA.png","name":"República Pureza Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Galáxias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabiano Maciel","original_name":"Fabiano Maciel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d3223c9251413fd60025cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcello Ludwig Maia","original_name":"Marcello Ludwig Maia","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bf3055ba480201826bfb34","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1479687,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reynaldo Zangrandi","original_name":"Reynaldo Zangrandi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bf3062fc6538017cebb905","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Armando Lobo","original_name":"Armando Lobo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bf3073902012017cccc551","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1327202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabiano Maciel","original_name":"Fabiano Maciel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bf3034ba480201616a6206","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jordana Berg","original_name":"Jordana Berg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9WS1PuV87bYdmB2S3RNYHkzxoec.jpg","credit_id":"5b0fd9a99251415ea0005612","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifR2ZqNt4p3OkucJLvRGWEjNqey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":912,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/371QHNwofYEv0c7BE5mTnMq1dxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":608}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
