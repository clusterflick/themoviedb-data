On Valentine's Day in 2010, he decided to break up with coffee and see if he could make it 21 days. Set in sunny San Diego in a neighborhood called Ocean Beach, Buzzkill takes a light-hearted look at life, work, music, people, and of course, coffee. Along the way, Wes talks to hippies, yuppies, friends, dermatologists, tea gurus, coffeeshop owners, and the metal detector guy. Buzzkill is not anti-coffee, or even pro-coffee. It's not \"Super Size Me\" with caffeine. Shot with no crew or budget, it's an honest documentation of one man's quest to better himself and those around him in the process. -  Wes Davis","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/w4tOuTGZkoeKf9Mu3JFRHyy2G2w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buzzkill: Is There Life After Coffee?","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Davis","original_name":"Wes Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c07de923be4600b2f0f2ec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Davis","original_name":"Wes Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07e56df857c0081414230","department":"Camera","job":"Key Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Avery","original_name":"Dylan Avery","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07e0adf857c007cbdf2c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Avery","original_name":"Dylan Avery","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07e3ddf857c0089272ed7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Avery","original_name":"Dylan Avery","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07e17df857c00d9c0aaae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dylan Avery","original_name":"Dylan Avery","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07e39a5743d007d1162c7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Davis","original_name":"Wes Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07df0e16e5a008ac790c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Davis","original_name":"Wes Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c07e2f05a53300c10ffe0d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1933551","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w4tOuTGZkoeKf9Mu3JFRHyy2G2w.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/op9ACUDvEmqxiG8u6UCS45tv7IA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
