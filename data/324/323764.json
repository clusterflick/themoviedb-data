This is distinct from a fever, where there is a physiological increase in the temperature set point of the body. The term \"stroke\" in \"heat stroke\" is a misnomer in that it does not involve a blockage or a hemorrhage of blood flow to the brain. Treatment involves rapid physical cooling.","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":"/sQbWdiXqKQnNdDSpTBM0IRHrIPs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heat Stroke and Sun Safety","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ヒート・ストローク","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1457,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQbWdiXqKQnNdDSpTBM0IRHrIPs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1031}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
