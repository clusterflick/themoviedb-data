The village poor have too little money, and the richer are tight-fisted. She has given a whole 15 years of savings -- yet the good priest, for whom she works as a maid, is not enthusiastic about her action because he is worried that the memorial will not remind the villagers of past horrors and suffering but disguise the human cost of war in rhetoric. As the memorial's advocates begin to sustain the day, flashbacks show how the woman's youngest son shot his captain, deserted the army, and came to die of fever while in his mother's care. The priest helped her as much as possible, yet he feels compelled to tell the authorities that her son was a deserter.","popularity":0.5435,"poster_path":"/sRGCTyX5o6BY3MPMTQIgT8gbxLT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1983-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deserter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2945704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isella Orchis","original_name":"Isella Orchis","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6009518798f1f1003ce96cd4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Papas","original_name":"Irene Papas","popularity":0.5207,"profile_path":"/5L9s3RdHpHnexq5tskFwqEQyMIf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mariangela","credit_id":"600951a2cb8028003ffc630b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mattia Sbragia","original_name":"Mattia Sbragia","popularity":0.6187,"profile_path":"/uQYa5QiHBMLZ0nAtnWEDMUwrTZa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Saverio","credit_id":"600951bbd70594003b1ace2e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omero Antonutti","original_name":"Omero Antonutti","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/2MWM2DCyuQM1fLoplTCeN2KsJY7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Father Coi","credit_id":"600953312d531a0055618263","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuliana Berlinguer","original_name":"Giuliana Berlinguer","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d06c8b9251417c1a0024f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757570,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giuseppe Dessi","original_name":"Giuseppe Dessi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600950fc98f1f1003de9bd6b","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuliana Berlinguer","original_name":"Giuliana Berlinguer","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600950e4fb3f61004a43bc6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1396247,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Enrica Biscossi","original_name":"Enrica Biscossi","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600951387d5504003dbce0a5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Assistant Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":978927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Massimo Felisatti","original_name":"Massimo Felisatti","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60095116cf9ba3004082a799","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085444","wikidata_id":"Q3793824","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/sRGCTyX5o6BY3MPMTQIgT8gbxLT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":11111,"name":"war memorial"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"1983-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago International Film Festival","release_date":"1983-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
