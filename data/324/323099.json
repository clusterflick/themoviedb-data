In spite of the fact that fourth husband Robert is a good provider, good step-dad, and all-around good sport about Jackie's rather wild ways, Jackie is intent on divorcing him although she seems to bear the man no resentment. It just seems that her only reason is that it's time for a change, much like an impulse to buy a new hat. Both children are upset about her decision since they have great affection for Robert. However, daughter Lee has just arrived home from school and decides to accompany her mother to Reno to look after her. On the train west, Lee meets a young mining engineer, Tom, who is headed to a job interview in California. The two hit it off and a romance buds.","popularity":0.5962,"poster_path":"/ihKK0vg33DgdBcrIFQ2IqbyqOFN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ripping the Lid Off America's Hot Spot","title":"The Road to Reno","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilyan Tashman","original_name":"Lilyan Tashman","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/vZPbaXbyMUxnxtEjiJYaMuvWD9T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jackie Millet","credit_id":"54cfe210c3a3687f8800b6bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers","original_name":"Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers","popularity":0.1976,"profile_path":"/gE4DZo9Z4FXxsC4bt1ixXztBkUj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Wood","credit_id":"54cfe21c925141474900aafe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Shannon","original_name":"Peggy Shannon","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/zBZnCypoaIJ6c85b4v4uZQPdl1w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lee Millet","credit_id":"54cfe228c3a3687f9200a478","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William 'Stage' Boyd","original_name":"William 'Stage' Boyd","popularity":0.175,"profile_path":"/zS3F4RNqZAsVUm1VsTEq5fA4uf7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jerry Kenton","credit_id":"54cfe235925141475b00abfc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irving Pichel","original_name":"Irving Pichel","popularity":0.3416,"profile_path":"/mUWJiT1z5XpXowXQuiREAon595L.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Millet","credit_id":"58da83a8c3a36831ad0002ec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wynne Gibson","original_name":"Wynne Gibson","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":"/jVRHrNfZZZuoAGOgGPetkgfLtLo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. It-Ritch","credit_id":"58da83b8c3a36831ad0002f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","original_name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/tFmOBk854vXe5dbeO9faNFPBy6j.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hoppie","credit_id":"58da83d4925141109b0002ba","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Douglas","original_name":"Tom Douglas","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/4trdWnEWYEGXosaMirp9GMCQhNL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jeff Millett","credit_id":"58da83e7c3a36831c300030b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1047396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Wood","original_name":"Judith Wood","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/vjXy3vc2DX14kK9tfnCwGGNaVyB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Elsie Kenton","credit_id":"58da83f592514110840002e8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leni Stengel","original_name":"Leni Stengel","popularity":0.3898,"profile_path":"/rZDr0A1W9iiAQ0D0EtFMOAkJcZb.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Stafford Howes","credit_id":"58da8404c3a3683197000318","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Émile Chautard","original_name":"Émile Chautard","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/kl4uS46oKd46Nf0OpPps33If9tm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Andre","credit_id":"58da8414c3a36831b80002c8","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrienne Ames","original_name":"Adrienne Ames","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/65OYTWasA379OLNrAsbdqVTWhP8.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Unhappy Divorcee","credit_id":"58da8429c3a368319f00031a","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Apfel","original_name":"Oscar Apfel","popularity":0.291,"profile_path":"/1HxUEleoPk99JVDqzEDzaljMLih.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Mr. Ash","credit_id":"58da8439c3a36831c3000342","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles D.
