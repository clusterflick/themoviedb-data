He grew up in a patriarchal family with his mother, father and two siblings. Home life was strict and regimented, his father was clearly the master of the house. But as a devout Jehovahs Witness, this was hardly out of the ordinary. On the surface, Donalds youth would resonate with anyone raised in the slow-paced sanctity of a small town. Years later, Donald would reveal a sad tale of survival, struggle and strife in his book, A Fathers Touch, his memoirs about enduring years of sexual abuse at the hands of his father, subsequently retold in this documentary Family Secrets, When Nobody's Looking.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Secrets: When Nobody's Looking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
