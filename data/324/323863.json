It had to be a piece of the work that mainly would be shown abroad, so that the rest of the world could make acquaintance with the beautiful countryside, with the modern side of the Dutch society and with historic building and old customs. After everything he had already made about these subjects, Haanstra was able to find a new angle, this time by observing the matter from the air. The result is a pretty mosaic of The Netherlands like it looked in the early eighties.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/ubdw4tmU0uzAngVjeT4OWgAhQwr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bert Haanstra Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1983-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Netherlands","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"5505724cc3a368058100109a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718d32de833d92ef05fae2f","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718d338e833d92ef05fae33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718d340769107d77b475514","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556023,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anton van Munster","original_name":"Anton van Munster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718d39127bd57d91f6224b1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3069488,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Raymond Grégoire","original_name":"Raymond Grégoire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718d3a19ff681d9e0a39301","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23576,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jurre Haanstra","original_name":"Jurre Haanstra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718d3aac7802cc50359a661","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0086000","wikidata_id":"Q1831893","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ouIoVEn8N0iYXbXN3Djku01KKQw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ubdw4tmU0uzAngVjeT4OWgAhQwr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":885}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
