So it seems, because while on an Italian holiday with his family, he conceives the idea that his aging wife should assume the role of his mother, and his daughter, who has an infant son, should assume the role of his wife and lover. His real mother, an elderly invalid, dies just as this conceit begins to take form, and, inexplicably, the women placidly go along with this odd notion for a time, but eventually return to their former roles.","popularity":0.2485,"poster_path":"/fXeXRMtvDb6hxUeMNhs4vA2Mvqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erato Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":139666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Istituto Luce-Italnoleggio Cinematografico","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":68520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gam Film S.r.l.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1993-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Next Time the Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Et ensuite, le feu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Rochefort","original_name":"Jean Rochefort","popularity":0.5365,"profile_path":"/wyvdO0ih9mwLE3UHCy8GudqnKTK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amedeo","credit_id":"618e7d8520e6a500443cf74d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","original_name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","popularity":0.314,"profile_path":"/uKaE6e4u3IuhhYslqtmICc2GssY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elena","credit_id":"618e7d981c635b0029f853cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Kedrova","original_name":"Lila Kedrova","popularity":0.2004,"profile_path":"/5Yfzzv9q6VzegrWud7Dl6GsjT1O.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"618e7da694631800430cc9b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Lustig","original_name":"Jacqueline Lustig","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/51GbAK7ILmLE8oYohOiFbf77B8V.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"618e7db79a8a8a004352b5b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidija Kozlovič","original_name":"Lidija Kozlovič","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Diana","credit_id":"618e7df366a7c30092d168b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrizia De Clara","original_name":"Patrizia De Clara","popularity":0.3283,"profile_path":"/tuaOXOZFZQRuuemy3Lbf5z4Axuk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Malvina","credit_id":"618e7e0010dad60092ff447b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Mocci","original_name":"Silvia Mocci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bride","credit_id":"618e7e0ee741460084d00ace","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Andrei","original_name":"Valerio Andrei","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/9WYBa4uKx7G7HIxCMSVFS1Rs9sg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Groom","credit_id":"618e7e18a313b8002a9a7e25","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81507,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fabio Carpi","original_name":"Fabio Carpi","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d319339251413fd6002445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107891","wikidata_id":"Q18809218","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":969,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/fXeXRMtvDb6hxUeMNhs4vA2Mvqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":646},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dWBnWPJlg7cUKb9GVJuNtWNawZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"1993-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
