Windup is a very original comedy. We follow Bernie Shaddick from his tragic childhood, through to his present day pursuit of a career as an inventor. Likened to such films as \"Raising Arizona\" and \"The Big Lebowski\", gritty cohen-esque humor saturates Bernie Shaddick's life, from his encounter with mace at a potential sale, to his murderous mentors posing as his Aunt Audre and Uncle Reg. Bernie is a man who, in the face of rejection and ridicule, just \"doesn't get it\", and perseveres anyways","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1093396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
