Beck betrays the apparent effortlessness of the original clips by editing them alongside the numerous rehearsals, variously self-conscious and obsessive, they required. With inter-titles and voice-over, Beck recapitulates his performances according to the video technology he used to produce them. As a result, the body, in its correlation with the evolution and obsolescence of technology, is revealed as a purely “enjoying” substance. Whether portraying a vindictive martyr in Bigmouth Strikes Again, a suicidal loner in Panic, or a comatose drag queen in Girlfriend In A Coma, Beck brings the violence and malice implicit in lead-singer Morrissey’s lyrics graphically to life.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Years Later (\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\")","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beck/Buck","original_name":"Robert Beck/Buck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192a46615376c00610c5cf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
