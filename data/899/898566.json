And in a few days it will be his 24th birthday.　　On an ordinary working day, Zhong Er is pursued by two forces: a group of demons, led by the female demon king Blood Demon (Zhang Luyao), who tries to kill him, and the goddess Meng Lulu (Wu Tong), who comes to his rescue and tells him that he is the descendant of the Heavenly Master Zhong Kui and has the important task of reviving him.　　Confused, Zhong Er eventually accepts Lulu's and his grandfather's training and fights against the blood demons, growing into a hero who subdues the demons and gradually enters the goddess' inner world in the process.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2016-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Killing Zhong Kui","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3300360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fan Jiaqi","original_name":"Fan Jiaqi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4tUf4FreJiApfFbvV2ZEfoM5NVp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zhong Er","credit_id":"61923dd163a695002b214abc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2484799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Luyao","original_name":"Zhang Luyao","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/wlFbI3qyS5zOLwUZErC1t7CKXtA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Blood Demon","credit_id":"61923ddfc4ad59008c7c9214","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3310424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Weiming","original_name":"Liu Weiming","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/40xeu64A6PVfxEwGIY9IEx0GJya.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61923dfa42f19f0068111b28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3310428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shan Changkai","original_name":"Shan Changkai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61923e3e01757f008a7aa744","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zheng Quan","original_name":"Zheng Quan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61923db9dbf1440092829274","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
