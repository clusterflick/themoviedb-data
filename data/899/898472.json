Ringed by a teeming Palestinian neighborhood, the Junction became a battleground in September 2000 when the Second Intifada erupted. The violence destroyed many lives there, Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers. Once a busy intersection and a flourishing neighborhood, it is now a desert. The film reaches far into the social fabric of both Israelis and Palestinians to explore the culture of death which both stems from and feeds the violence currently consuming both societies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Junction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Ziv","original_name":"Ilan Ziv","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6191e6f61f748b008e69af53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0392200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
