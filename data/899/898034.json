Influenced by Margaret Tait’s Aerial (1974), Kirkup, Carey and the children played, played, and played again with the materials around them; light, water, air, earth and trees. Knowing and knowing anew how we meet and compose these materialities through moving, making, looking and listening. The images and soundtrack are made from the children’s own recordings of their surroundings, a song they wrote, and fragments of their play.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest of Everything","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3308862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Carey","original_name":"Richard Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6190f747a6d931002a4df96c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy Kirkup","original_name":"Wendy Kirkup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6190f77aa9b9a400624c9715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
