In an attempt to understand his parents' radical choices, he dives into the family archive. Extraordinary amateur films and private writings reveal never-ending conflicts and painful memories. Those of a father, a revolutionary commander, who sacrificed everything in the name of political struggle, but who saw his dream of justice vanish. Those of a son, who grew up in the shadow of a charismatic but cumbersome man, unable to accept the needs of a child. Those of a mother. A ghost that has haunted Camilo's dreams since he was five years old. A unique opportunity to give life to an impossible dialogue, long desired but never really happened.","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":"/pNiIF5YAWNsy1ve6rlA4iwMo0Q1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143854,"logo_path":"/lV9inJ52UxHtwMlwm8EEUyfd0nj.png","name":"Inercia Películas","origin_country":"CO"},{"id":113821,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmAffair","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Zuluagas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Camilo Zuluaga Tordecilla","original_name":"Juan Camilo Zuluaga Tordecilla","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Juan Camilo Zuluaga Tordecilla","credit_id":"622d4b8f1d1bf4001b151a24","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1725359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paola Andrea Pérez","original_name":"Paola Andrea Pérez","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/2RIudIftDxVhvNiPDSjQyCAIpUo.jpg","credit_id":"622d3f20221ba600468496e4","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223878,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valeria Adilardi","original_name":"Valeria Adilardi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d4b222afb25001bc69f42","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966790,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luca Ricciardi","original_name":"Luca Ricciardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d4b30f90b19007b1e49a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Romano","original_name":"Laura Romano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d4b3c22931a001be02cd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2157442,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mauro Vicentini","original_name":"Mauro Vicentini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622d4b4fb84cdd004850f9ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3310309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Flavia Montini","original_name":"Flavia Montini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qEEATu1hcGokS9P5fn9uKkEHRjC.jpg","credit_id":"61921fcbdbf14400928280d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17501074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kmEo4UDoGXMwnTLpVImBcchUKvg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/VJRye1uT04JT83OkUCXtilYlGS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3LchSScG2WjMMCWWrlXVcUSaAT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oS4bQJ4YiCsyEyYLs89kQGrxzJ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.709,"height":505,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WveJGnnlIUgv0xhusJOSKBXo3r.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":863},{"aspect_ratio":1,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y1ssMiNnOkA1wWOCzI6tnGxEDWV.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":3.102,"height":49,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bMEYUhWt9mIGnKqM3fGBuK8L20C.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":152},{"aspect_ratio":5.525,"height":303,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lV9inJ52UxHtwMlwm8EEUyfd0nj.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1674}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pNiIF5YAWNsy1ve6rlA4iwMo0Q1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1447}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8996,"name":"medellín, colombia"},{"id":265022,"name":"conflicto"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
