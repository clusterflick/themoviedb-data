He is the author of the most iconic pictures of the Colombian political leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, assassinated in 1948, giving birth to one of the cruellest waves of violence in the country. Since ever, Lunga's photographs have been reproduced over and over again without the proper credits. This film is a trip to the 40's and 50's Colombia's decades and it wants to give to Lunga the recognition of his work and his name in the history of Colombia as a photographer.","popularity":0.0949,"poster_path":"/g0LFX03v60t6VTbW5BjDk8PS6fW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164555,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Doble Poder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A la Carga Lunga!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mónica Juanita Hernández","original_name":"Mónica Juanita Hernández","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193142042f19f0029b0f640","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mónica Juanita Hernández","original_name":"Mónica Juanita Hernández","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193142763a6950042f3d68c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iván Gaona","original_name":"Iván Gaona","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7DJbFxma71kxzkY3hmuo1GK0wXn.jpg","credit_id":"6193143cc99826002b0c1ef9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mónica Juanita Hernández","original_name":"Mónica Juanita Hernández","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619314a7ccde04002c884257","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555992,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miguel Antonio Zanguña","original_name":"Miguel Antonio Zanguña","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619411ef6c1e04002a4fd058","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12742766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1361,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g0LFX03v60t6VTbW5BjDk8PS6fW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":907}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
