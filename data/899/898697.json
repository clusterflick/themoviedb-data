It was created for a show titled Song Poems, which took as its departure a popular 1960-70s mail-order phenomenon, advertised in the back of magazines, offering to set poems to music in an array of styles and return them as 'singles.' The exhibition brought together musicians and video artists to set original poems by a variety of artists and writers to music and images. I created a video for an original poem by the showâ€™s curator, Steven Hull, with music composed by The Pony Express, an alternative New York rock band.\" -- Robert Beck","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song Poem (Trips Visits)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beck/Buck","original_name":"Robert Beck/Buck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192a41dc998260044d543bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
