When he tries to entertain himself by drawing his favorite superhero, he reaches for a pencil and accidentally activates a hidden tripwire—sending him careening down a trapdoor into a dark, mysterious cavern. Confronted with a tall, imposing steel door, Dennis crosses the threshold and discovers that his beloved world of heroes and villains was a lot closer to home than he ever could have dreamed!","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/czMtsjGYc8QGJFg1wJrkIWXYes0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Origin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Sisak","original_name":"Katherine Sisak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192b7a701757f002c95aa4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Sisak","original_name":"Katherine Sisak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192b7bbccb15f00944926e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310898,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nico Wiscour-Conter","original_name":"Nico Wiscour-Conter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192b7ca63a6950042f311ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3310899,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Brautigam","original_name":"John Brautigam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192b7d2dbf14400685cd5f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":864,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/czMtsjGYc8QGJFg1wJrkIWXYes0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":607}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2021","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Joedance Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
