Everyone here knows each other, and almost everything about each other. Everything here is like under a magnifying glass. The patriarchal way of life has changed little in recent years with technical progress. The old and the new. Everything here that is ugly bulges out with a vengeance, but the good things also do not go unnoticed. This film is a parable: a story about Russia, about the customs that prevail in the modern village.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/g66CTHfYq5T2mkHJLuSfEewNXSJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Deluge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Posle Potopa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Pēc plūdiem","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3422551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oleg Khon","original_name":"Oleg Khon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206f20fdb154f00db7c40c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3422549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valentina Fedorchenko","original_name":"Valentina Fedorchenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206f1f1e640d60043487465","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2037368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Eisner","original_name":"Vladimir Eisner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ex8pAySPBbXnfYJZC0qiWQHGkrA.jpg","credit_id":"6206f1d6cae17c001b1e944e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimir Tyumentsev","original_name":"Vladimir Tyumentsev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206f1e5ae6f0900d01fb824","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2037368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Eisner","original_name":"Vladimir Eisner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ex8pAySPBbXnfYJZC0qiWQHGkrA.jpg","credit_id":"67992813702f492f478f9025","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g66CTHfYq5T2mkHJLuSfEewNXSJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Curtas de Belo Horizonte","release_date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2022-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
