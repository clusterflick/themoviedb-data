He saw the writing on the wall long before the great majority of German Jews and decided to use his great wealth for the rescue of as many people as possible. For example, he provided the finance for the creation of a children's settlement in Palestine, helped hundreds of his employees to emigrate (paying them two years' wages!), and not only inspired the Kindertransport movement but supported the operation financially.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/4BKsz0u3fDJua8whtIzy40mVP2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Essential Link: The Story of Wilfrid Israel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yonatan Nir","original_name":"Yonatan Nir","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa61568c3a36839d5003b1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5921554","wikidata_id":"Q95457758","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4BKsz0u3fDJua8whtIzy40mVP2c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
