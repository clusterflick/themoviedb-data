In 1823, the Governor of the largest fur-trading company in the world travels across his Dominion, extracting ever-greater riches from the winter bounty of animal furs. In his brutal world of profit and loss, animals are slaughtered to the brink of extinction until the balance of power shifts, and the forces of nature exact their own terrible price.  With nods to Melville and Coleridge, directors Carol Beecher & Kevin Kurytnik have created a visually stunning contemporary myth about the cost of arrogance and greed.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/yzQ0UstLGd7LoJZrHRZkMZhxUEV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skin for Skin","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin D.A.
