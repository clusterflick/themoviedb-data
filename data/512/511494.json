Escher : l'air et l'eau 1 mixes traditional and computer animation -- accompanied by a stunning soundtrack -- to playfully explore and deconstruct the optical illusion within one of the artist's most famous works. A fitting homage to a master on the 100th anniversary of his birth. A film without words.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/auUFC6oTLVz3sdCLlFMftb5LS36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"M.C.
