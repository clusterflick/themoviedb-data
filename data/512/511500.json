An \"under-the-bed\" monster wanders through a slumbering household, wreaking typical monster havoc. First a little girl, then an older brother, and finally the teenaged big sister. It's surprising, to both the monster and to us, what frightens each of them. A film without words.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/4h1cYJqO7hBPotKisDhzTnIKatB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Monster's Calling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Johnson","original_name":"Louise Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67922f41316dcc0337470322","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1386,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4h1cYJqO7hBPotKisDhzTnIKatB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":924}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
