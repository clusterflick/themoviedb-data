We follow a boy's courageous journey to the spirit world to find the only one who can save his village from the resulting darkness--the Lord of the sky. An artistic unity of form and content, Lord of the Sky is a dazzling combination of 3-D models, puppets, special effects and cut-out paper animation. Its intricate, beautifully rendered drawings reflect the natural environment and cultural heritage of the Pacific Northwest. The film speaks strongly of the need for ecological balance in the world.","popularity":0.3106,"poster_path":"/6Y0aIVpuiOB0Y8egE3Kkl9NoBty.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lord of the Sky","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Le maître du ciel","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Nelson","original_name":"Alex Nelson","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"64875d48bf31f25057078bba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Newman","original_name":"Marian Newman","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"64875d5099259c01392c7c3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Whetung","original_name":"Daniel Whetung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"64875d58c0348b013c1dbbad","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1996926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugen Spálený","original_name":"Eugen Spálený","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6ec750e0a263dcd011ac0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1558688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludmila Zeman","original_name":"Ludmila Zeman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6ec6bc3a36839d50124c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3126137,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie McLean","original_name":"Barrie McLean","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64875dcce375c0011c8101c0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389416,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis L.
