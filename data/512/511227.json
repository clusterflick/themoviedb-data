I grew up in a fundamental Christian community that built their identity on the understanding of Christianity to be the only true way of living, and therefore a critical reflection about the absolute rightness of their beliefs was utterly out of question. Nonbelievers were seen as \"lacking something\", as people who either need to be educated or avoided. A binary opposition which decried all non-Christian cultures and people as incomplete was imposed, in order to define their own Christian identity as superior and to gain power over the other. The supremacy of an all-encompassing God who divides the world in \"right\" and \"wrong\", \"heaven\" and \"hell\" and the demand to commit to such a God always felt restrictive to me and deprived me of the agency.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qpatFeTZ527KAp7Tq4ukqL6XpYK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A lot of things don't, don't really exist anymore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stella Meris","original_name":"Stella Meris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5aa6d3a29251415e4200e68c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stella Meris","original_name":"Stella Meris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6d367c3a36839cb00eeb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qpatFeTZ527KAp7Tq4ukqL6XpYK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
