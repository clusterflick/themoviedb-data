Radiant colours and smooth-flowing animation evoke sizzling lava rivers, oceans bursting with life, and freezing ice ages. The film provides an excellent view of the time frame within which these remarkable events took place and highlights the fact that, relatively speaking, we are newcomers to Planet Earth.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/mwx6RsF12gAIv0S3QEOZXnt6XTk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Billion Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joyce Borenstein","original_name":"Joyce Borenstein","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6d2d90e0a263dd000f6f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225750","wikidata_id":"Q123287654","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mwx6RsF12gAIv0S3QEOZXnt6XTk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":592}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
