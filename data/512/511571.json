The return of blood-red Sockeye salmon up BCâ€™s Adams River has repeated itself for millennia and if left uninterrupted, will do so for centuries to come. Most intriguingly, while the migration of fish repeats year after year, within it, the astounding patterns of dense, roiling salmon never repeat. In pools and back eddies along the Adams River, thousands of salmon create dynamic and mesmerizing patterns. It is natural and colossal. It is moving art. People locked in urban centres can easily forget that rivers in the wilderness exist and that those forgotten rivers provide a heartbeat for humanity. Removed from the surge of migrations, the unknowing and uninformed actions of human kind can threaten to stop that wild heartbeat. Splitting the screen into multiple images, UNINTERRUPTED brings the heart of the river into the heart of the city.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jlGGn4JvHW0s0gSuKjHakFhbHUS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uninterrupted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1484637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nettie Wild","original_name":"Nettie Wild","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa83e439251415e390258c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3486914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1056,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jlGGn4JvHW0s0gSuKjHakFhbHUS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4COC663kGCZ4ls7DmD3jWs7912o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
