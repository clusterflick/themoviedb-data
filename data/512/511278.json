Like thousands of other Japanese Canadians, Minoru and his family were branded as an enemy of Canada, dispatched to internment camps in the interior of British Columbia, and finally deported to Japan. Directed by Michael Fukushima, Minoru's son, the film artfully combines classical animation with archival material. The memories of the father are interspersed with the voice of the son, weaving a tale of suffering and survival, of a birthright lost and recovered.","popularity":0.2367,"poster_path":"/ulj1FesWFSgWOt5CGjVlieuHKK2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minoru: Memory of Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Fukushima","original_name":"Michael Fukushima","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646669a0d1857201402fb050","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Fukushima","original_name":"Michael Fukushima","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6ee090e0a263dd00120c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236501","wikidata_id":"Q17010298","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1056,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pjwx2TlWbvhibQ8b9dtYS81luFx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":915,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ulj1FesWFSgWOt5CGjVlieuHKK2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":610}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":2428,"name":"deportation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
