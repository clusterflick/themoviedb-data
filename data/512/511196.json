The title is a play on the French quatuor, meaning quartet, but the chorus is not the usual alley-cat variety. The cat in this film is talented indeed. He is both pianist and piano, trumpet and trumpeter and, if need be, even becomes the music--a pulsing rock and roll--or a whole swarm of alley cats.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v2veCHSp153XhGdzNha4mddnV8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catuor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Klein","original_name":"Judith Klein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6c9cd9251415e4200d8b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gordon Fleming","original_name":"Gordon Fleming","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67236055d9a8a77b5da47913","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032989,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herbert Spanier","original_name":"Herbert Spanier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672360690cd8a2a503ad0d68","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196814,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel Donato","original_name":"Michel Donato","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672360730cd8a2a503ad0d6e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032990,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric MacDonald","original_name":"Eric MacDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6723607fd9a8a77b5da47926","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"6723609c0cd8a2a503ad0d7b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0218877","wikidata_id":"Q49828377","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v2veCHSp153XhGdzNha4mddnV8Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
