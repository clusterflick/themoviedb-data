So why, in this case, is the tooth fairy a no-show? These are the sorts of questions a father needs to be able to answer for his son… In this brilliantly simple animated short, Quebec cartoonist Guy Delisle brings to the screen the titular parent of his popular series, Le guide du mauvais père (A User’s Guide to Neglectful Parenting), published by Delcourt. Inspired by a common childhood experience, Delisle uses his trademark wry humour to reflect on the vagaries of parenting. A slice of everyday life, courtesy of the Comic Strip Chronicles.","popularity":0.0904,"poster_path":"/njtaPryqpQr3Sd14Zlk7iSNtV1M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12433,"logo_path":"/sKu7Gr83ie8w6waDwYNHMBEaSah.png","name":"Sacrebleu Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tooth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1709856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Delisle","original_name":"Guy Delisle","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6a24d9251415e4500abf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114358,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Calvert","original_name":"Olivier Calvert","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":"/e3iZCsoamtUcVDmN1rwsxAJVFgr.jpg","credit_id":"5f0edf73f14dad003333e531","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130169,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ron Dyens","original_name":"Ron Dyens","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/w7cTqN7hZw6x0n2JyhunjyvG1O0.jpg","credit_id":"5f0ee0160f36550037e330ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Roy","original_name":"Julie Roy","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0edfcb6c84920037792996","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1841229,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mélanie Bouchard","original_name":"Mélanie Bouchard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0edf9ce267de0032aa3952","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220020,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denis Pilon","original_name":"Denis Pilon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0edfadf14dad003532377e","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712959,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michèle Labelle","original_name":"Michèle Labelle","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0edf8fdb154f00360b5f1d","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Bertrand","original_name":"Marc Bertrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0edff6e267de0035aa9297","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/njtaPryqpQr3Sd14Zlk7iSNtV1M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
