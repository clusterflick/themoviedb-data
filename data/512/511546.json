While investigating a residential hotel in San Francisco’s Latino Mission District, Morales finds himself face to face with corruption at City Hall and the mysterious Sofia Nido, a beautiful flame from his past. Morales must also confront his own demons while investigating the crime and ends up caught in a dangerous web of deceit, as he gets drawn into the seedy underworld of bribery, corruption and murder. This independent Neo-noir feature film, based on a story by San Francisco Poet Laureate Alejandro Murguia, takes viewers deep into neighborhoods and communities seldom seen on film, while addressing issues around gentrification and displacement of low-income communities along the way.","popularity":0.1862,"poster_path":"/35b9VXxZwbtwM9D0KxO7UMbGqGq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Barrio","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Montoya","original_name":"Richard Montoya","popularity":0.1234,"profile_path":"/xcBZfNXw49TC1FCSqAh7bIWV5xj.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Roberto Morales","credit_id":"5aa919200e0a263dc703420f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Valencia","original_name":"Veronica Valencia","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/wFAxNu8gK0TXjpQQ9SMzY5Pr06G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sofia","credit_id":"5aa9192f0e0a263dd3037cca","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1998083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dante Betteo","original_name":"Dante Betteo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa919559251415e4b030244","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7851080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/35b9VXxZwbtwM9D0KxO7UMbGqGq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":759,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hE5QykTsTuskb3ButpcTSFfE4wf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
