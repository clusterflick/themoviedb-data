Music, drawing, colour and movement here follow a moving, classic restraint. Daedalus, inventor of many things, provides the wings to escape from Crete, but Icarus, his son, impetuously flies too close to the sun. In this film, artist and composer share equal pleasure in the telling, with a feeling the audience will share. A film without words.","popularity":0.0622,"poster_path":"/2Wapadj3H2lWebzS9vPOXxYM6Vv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Icarus","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bochner","original_name":"Paul Bochner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6c6c00e0a263dc400e2bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226801","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Wapadj3H2lWebzS9vPOXxYM6Vv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
