The film begins with shots of friends’ and fans’ last words written on Smith’s memorial on Sunset Boulevard, then to footage of a Macy’s parade, focusing closely on the oddly outfitted participants, some in renaissance attire, cowboys with lassos, and beauty queens. The film is scored with Smith’s music, resulting in a melancholy effect, especially in the segment that follows Smith through the woods and films him as he digs up a guitar, then plays a song. This footage is repeated in the end of the film, but in a negative reversal print, suggesting pretty damn clearly that the subject matter has moved beyond the veil.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/yLfr8ARJhtdA5pVbF18GymHdOcm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elliott's Suicide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elliott Smith","original_name":"Elliott Smith","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/kQRk3obgX9QXG5FBrZXnQCDZBYc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"672e974972ba92c1087a0540","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elliott Smith","original_name":"Elliott Smith","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/kQRk3obgX9QXG5FBrZXnQCDZBYc.jpg","credit_id":"65d560eff29d660164e89daf","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Anger","original_name":"Kenneth Anger","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/gspoSoEjQSpBKBQx3g9frjFOM7f.jpg","credit_id":"5aa92e600e0a263dcd035dbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yLfr8ARJhtdA5pVbF18GymHdOcm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":633}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
