It is a highly stylized and impressionistic rendering; each scene corresponds to a step in the process. Black and white photographs, representing reality, are overlaid with animated colour drawings, representing fantasy. It illustrates the artist braving creative storms, indulging runaway imagination and learning, by trial and error, to take possession of his creative energy. Film without words.","popularity":0.2264,"poster_path":"/u2lcwyykvY6lV5KXggTxj0V0Q78.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carried Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Pakarnyk","original_name":"Alan Pakarnyk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371f7494631801032acb11","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Randolph Peters","original_name":"Randolph Peters","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371f7a1f748b00d5ef7ce2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ken Rodeck","original_name":"Ken Rodeck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371f85aede5900f408f470","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ken Rodeck","original_name":"Ken Rodeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371f919ac53501062804a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203687,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andreas Poulsson","original_name":"Andreas Poulsson","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371f9baede590113323bf8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007446,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Drew Lawson","original_name":"Drew Lawson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371fa69ac5350129b46ce1","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4007447,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Svend-Erik Ericson","original_name":"Svend-Erik Ericson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371fb69463180077f20b92","department":"Camera","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Condie","original_name":"Richard Condie","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371fbd1f748b00f448ab25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ken Rodeck","original_name":"Ken Rodeck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371fc41f748b00b6a3e5b0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958519,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Guerin","original_name":"Pierre Guerin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371fdcaede59009799a4ba","department":"Sound","job":"Music Sound Design and Processing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194573,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clive Perry","original_name":"Clive Perry","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371fe71f748b00d5ef7cfe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237236,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cyndi Forcand","original_name":"Cyndi Forcand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371ff2fd4f800111faf016","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222738,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vonnie Von Helmolt","original_name":"Vonnie Von Helmolt","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64371ff96dc6c000d4909e4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael J.F.
