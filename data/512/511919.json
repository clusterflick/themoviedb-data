The days are over where these fishermen were self-evidently succeeded by their sons. On board Nino’s ship, the reigning peace is not what it appears to be. The twelve-man crew that mans the small boat is in complete concentration. They peer at the water surface, looking for their prey. While the diesel engine stamps monotonously, the hours pass and we wait patiently. Then an excited noise erupts from the crow’s nest: a swordfish couple has been spotted! Lipari pays homage to an almost extinct profession.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/7MM9VTqQ1okTNkqHKDu2B2r87pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49794,"logo_path":"/bFqE3eQjWlVjValkuzoBHIY3uV2.png","name":"Zeppers","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2007-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lipari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van den Engel","original_name":"Frank van den Engel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaa7be7c3a36851d600d23a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Melle van Essen","original_name":"Melle van Essen","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaa7c310e0a2664ff00dd1d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willemijn Cerutti","original_name":"Willemijn Cerutti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaa7c110e0a26650800c892","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383312,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jorinde Sorée","original_name":"Jorinde Sorée","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaa7bf9c3a36851d600d245","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van den Engel","original_name":"Frank van den Engel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaa7bb5925141057900d3e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7MM9VTqQ1okTNkqHKDu2B2r87pg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
