A story unfolds on the blanket as it grows longer, illustrating the ancient tale of Haida master sea hunter Naa-Naa-Simgat and his beloved, Kuuga Kuns. When a SGaana (the Haida word for “killer whale”) captures the hunter and drags him down into a supernatural world, the courageous Kuuga Kuns sets off to save him.  Will the lovers manage to escape the undersea Mountain of SGaana, or will they, too, become part of the Haida spirit world forever?","popularity":0.3651,"poster_path":"/9fZXubxCaxxFVPnJYzG5b40nTdn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mountain of SGaana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":962887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Loring","original_name":"Kevin Loring","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"The Skipper / The Being","credit_id":"5f42209447721500355fdf8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devery Jacobs","original_name":"Devery Jacobs","popularity":0.3608,"profile_path":"/74QH7KCW6ZI2ekIYYCV4NyGet4X.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Kuuga Kuns","credit_id":"5f4220a447721500325e9279","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712934,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tara Barker","original_name":"Tara Barker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c8c6907216600ff375947","department":"Lighting","job":"Rigging Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawna Mauchline","original_name":"Shawna Mauchline","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c8c7074507d01395b4a9d","department":"Lighting","job":"Rigging Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4304295,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Amanda Mauchline","original_name":"Amanda Mauchline","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c8c7b967cc734295e3a88","department":"Lighting","job":"Rigging Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3082623,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Christopher Auchter","original_name":"Christopher Auchter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c8c87967cc73425f1de95","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124986,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sitji Chou","original_name":"Sitji Chou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c8c8d74507d00ac46c05a","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3614715,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lou Papa","original_name":"Lou Papa","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c8c94223a8b00c45c035e","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2114392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathleen S.
