Rachit is an urbane guy and Shikhar has a 'small-town' rustic charm - the differences between them are evident during their interactions. But as the evening progresses, Rachit recollects some forgotten memories from a distant past. Together, they revisit the roads not taken; and, the lines between the past and the present get blurred. Set in Mumbai, India, this romantic drama is a contemporary take on the life and relationships of a single professional gay man - his understanding of his identity, missed opportunities, and personal choices.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/3uUhtuhXrlZ91KgyJvtPvQpcWgE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opportunity","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anuj Jain","original_name":"Anuj Jain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rachit","credit_id":"5d04bd4e9251416876bdb436","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vikrant Verma","original_name":"Vikrant Verma","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Shikhar","credit_id":"5d04bd67c3a36877db1ea061","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Apurva Chowdhary","original_name":"Apurva Chowdhary","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Anubhuti","credit_id":"5d04bd86925141131bb8f67f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raj Hanchanale","original_name":"Raj Hanchanale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aniket","credit_id":"5d04bd969251416876bdb46b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1998563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohit Goswami","original_name":"Mohit Goswami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aaa0b8092514105660070db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6534608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7kSDtO0szP7QibDjq60lcI7bDXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":882,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3uUhtuhXrlZ91KgyJvtPvQpcWgE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":588},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/haKOFsA61qOsQEKRyePrl5a2ey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
