Stone engravings record a complete absence of cooperation between the Egyptian ruler and his slaves but, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, there was a gradual change towards recognition of the labourer. With the growth of factories, the trend received a setback, but reasserted itself through the expediencies of World War II, which saw the formation of the first Labour Management Production Committee (LMPC) in Britain. In post-war Canada the film shows LMPCs well implanted in industrial life, with the Industrial Production Cooperation Board giving official government recognition.","popularity":0.09,"poster_path":"/194PyeCW6j4jdWnwp7j6gVvWX3R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teamwork - Past and Present","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Low","original_name":"Colin Low","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":"/nLNsXY9AzmjEfSoDXniMgwVGflJ.jpg","credit_id":"5aa6aa689251415e3f00b8fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0242025","wikidata_id":"Q123289018","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/194PyeCW6j4jdWnwp7j6gVvWX3R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
