Jamie fishes, plucks ducks, and traps rabbits. He helps his mother churn butter, collect eggs and bake bread. Children can compare the food Jamie eats with the food they eat - some of it the same, like buckwheat pancakes and blueberry muffins, and some of it different, like rabbit stew and duck pie.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1M92xs9glvOhMOj5ctjzivDaTaY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jamie Really Liked to Eat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jocelyn Rehder","original_name":"Jocelyn Rehder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa81b11c3a36839d102416c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1M92xs9glvOhMOj5ctjzivDaTaY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
