A local myth that identifies black priestesses and white herons inspires the narrative, which explores the symbology of “white” (“funfun” in Yoruba), commonly associated with purity, maturity, and wisdom, the color of mourning in many Oriental countries, and the color of the garments worn by the Black god Obatala. Out of this profusion of symbols, the artist creates his own funeral rite.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Funfun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayrson Heráclito","original_name":"Ayrson Heráclito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5yFTZodrI8YIhUPljKjIjvXNBSk.jpg","credit_id":"5aa95123c3a36839e4039238","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
