Instead of the agitprop montages that characterized the political cinema of Latin America in the 1960s and ‘70s, this film is dominated by a feeling of deceptive calm: a beach, lapping waves, a man reading in a hammock, two men in conversation... The violence that breaks into these scenes is hinted at more than it is depicted. Only a closing text panel dedicating the film to the murdered teachers of El Salvador establishes a clear political context. LA ZONA INTERTIDAL was shown at the Short Film Festival Oberhausen in 1982 and awarded one of the main prizes by the International Jury. The festival program listed a “Grupo los Vagos” as the author of the film, a four-member collective that had begun working together in 1969 as the theater collective Taller de Los Vagos and later switched to the medium of film.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/da2xfCh17YSXDB1HZEMAOm2z3DB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","name":"El Salvador"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intertidal Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyn Sorto","original_name":"Lyn Sorto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d4127fe194b00064968971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096929,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guillermo Escalon","original_name":"Guillermo Escalon","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d41263bb2602005b948c08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2210783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuel Sorto","original_name":"Manuel Sorto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d41288e194b0001cb52ec0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Noëlle Fontan","original_name":"Marie-Noëlle Fontan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d412737b7b4d0069cbc412","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/da2xfCh17YSXDB1HZEMAOm2z3DB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
