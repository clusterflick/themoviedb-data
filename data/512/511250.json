A group of children finds a magic quilt that is their passport to a voyage of discovery. They step inside the quilt and as they travel through its velvet farmlands and satin cities, they experience the multiculturalism of Canada. The quilt is torn and the magic broken when a quarrel breaks out. Once the quilt is repaired and harmony restored, the children have learned that patience and goodwill are needed to mend and maintain quilts, friendships, and nations.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/7uJS9b09mH96pXlQkYquMg9eF2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Quilt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bettina Maylone","original_name":"Bettina Maylone","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa6e5fd0e0a263dc10108fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226101","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uJS9b09mH96pXlQkYquMg9eF2q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
