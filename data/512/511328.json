It made it to the US where it played under another name on the Great White Way. This echt-Austrian work had first been popularized as a play shortly before the turn of the 20th c. This 2008 staging was celebrated as a reference performance for future attempts. Directed by Rolf Langenfass and conducted by Rudolf Bibl, the cast includes Harald Serafin as the Austro-Hungarian head-of-state Kaiser Franz Joseph II.","popularity":0.1802,"poster_path":"/16zgpZLrNW9ICwluYq27Nhikkah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the White Horse Inn","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Serafin","original_name":"Harald Serafin","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/c1Xyctk5THfOpYWtYmi7X3m2NdU.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5aa73255c3a36839cb0154b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainhard Fendrich","original_name":"Rainhard Fendrich","popularity":0.3583,"profile_path":"/l85z9MV3cDfyz9jtzPVe4Ozf796.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5aa73261c3a36839d10162f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1648442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zabine","original_name":"Zabine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vCu21cT5TnVpehwJU8CK56OUuQY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5aa732859251415e480141e3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Langenfass","original_name":"Rolf Langenfass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa732a4c3a36839cb0154df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Serafin","original_name":"Harald Serafin","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/c1Xyctk5THfOpYWtYmi7X3m2NdU.jpg","credit_id":"5aa732bc0e0a263dc7015b2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2380005","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16zgpZLrNW9ICwluYq27Nhikkah.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
