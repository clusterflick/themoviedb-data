The arrival of Jacques Cartier, the fishing and fur trades which followed, and the rival colonization by the French and British, climaxed by the battle of the Plains of Abraham, are depicted. The coming of the United Empire Loyalists is seen; then the west-coast gold rush and the completion of the transcontinental railway. New branches were added to the family tree when many European settlers came to fill the great spaces of the Prairies. Finally, we see the whole country matured into a nation, its traditions enriched by those of many peoples.","popularity":0.3184,"poster_path":"/jmrMFXXQCTa5PUk7XnYTtfatTDD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Tree","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":957757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldon Rathburn","original_name":"Eldon Rathburn","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641766772b8a430099f40961","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evelyn Lambart","original_name":"Evelyn Lambart","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":"/3mBzS7WzjdoZRjy3R7inPVSbuwp.jpg","credit_id":"6417666c5690b500bb01ce40","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641766710d5d8500e0e6b6f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dunning","original_name":"George Dunning","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/rBbcT2sk2K8ZoDoVuCzk2opZbTa.jpg","credit_id":"64176665e9c0dc0081ce2c4a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evelyn Lambart","original_name":"Evelyn Lambart","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":"/3mBzS7WzjdoZRjy3R7inPVSbuwp.jpg","credit_id":"5aa6a8b39251415e4b00afeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dunning","original_name":"George Dunning","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/rBbcT2sk2K8ZoDoVuCzk2opZbTa.jpg","credit_id":"5aa6a8aac3a36839da00b513","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223258","wikidata_id":"Q123289134","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jmrMFXXQCTa5PUk7XnYTtfatTDD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":313239,"name":"settlement"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
