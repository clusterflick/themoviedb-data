A man loves a woman; both of them love literature. We discover the murmur of their lives, the harmony of their feelings—and we learn how their affection for novels and poetry marks their existence beyond death. The fruitful alliance of filmmaker Félix Dufour-Laperrière’s imagery and the words of Quebec poet Hélène Dorion results in a subtle, sensitive film that resonates in the viewer’s heart and mind. In its hybridization of styles and techniques, The Day Is Listening is also a most modern and daring work: its director has deftly expanded the spectrum of traditional hand-drawn animation, incorporating mosaics of real images that express a myriad of intertwining memories as well as the pulse of urban life.","popularity":0.1155,"poster_path":"/8V8C103FhUWY1DOkGQ3DVgnvtVy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Day Is Listening","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063627,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jens Hahn","original_name":"Jens Hahn","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c2950f0da50040be2d03","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063628,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Dufour-Laperrière","original_name":"Gabriel Dufour-Laperrière","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c2ae0f0da50029b93dd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071389,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathieu Bouchard-Malo","original_name":"Mathieu Bouchard-Malo","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c33265e0a20078db3dfb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Roy","original_name":"Julie Roy","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c2cf7776f0006dd7c853","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Chénier","original_name":"René Chénier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c2c2126ec3003f23ed0d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2701285,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Linda Manouan","original_name":"Linda Manouan","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c322a1d332004074d337","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063628,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Dufour-Laperrière","original_name":"Gabriel Dufour-Laperrière","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c2a3a1d332004074d28c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063634,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alexis Aubin-Laperrière","original_name":"Alexis Aubin-Laperrière","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6081c31701b1ca0041eaae30","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félix Dufour-Laperrière","original_name":"Félix Dufour-Laperrière","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/o8ptiTaEeIch6OCHbo6WUuqMbe9.jpg","credit_id":"5aa83eb09251415e42024f24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3995688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8V8C103FhUWY1DOkGQ3DVgnvtVy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
