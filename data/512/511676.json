It is a self-consciously “cinematic” recreation of a journey through a land plagued by the ghosts of colonialism and the present anxiety of conflicting religious and political agendas - both of which can often seem one and the same. Evoking a surreal sense of place, both very present and very distant, the video depicts the hazy lines between notions of “foreign aid” “missionary practice” and “colonialism,” and shows the ways history has of recycling itself. The essayistic, experimental nature of the work is inspired by the politically charged silent-era montage of Dovzhenko, Vertov, and Eisenstein and the later impressionistic film and video works of Marker and Godard.","popularity":0.1963,"poster_path":"/oxqYaq7SAuKAJ5pT4AXmkGqFome.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SS","name":"South Sudan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Sundanese","iso_639_1":"su","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Voyage Dans جنوب السودان","title":"ten minutes is two hours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Snipes","original_name":"Jonathan Snipes","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c80a17ecd28011ef2bb33","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Kennelly","original_name":"Patrick Kennelly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d4a90e0a263dc102e441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Kennelly","original_name":"Patrick Kennelly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d584c3a36839d1030f72","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leo Garcia","original_name":"Leo Garcia","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d5550e0a263dd603026c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548949,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis Garcia","original_name":"Dennis Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d52e0e0a263dca03050d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Kennelly","original_name":"Patrick Kennelly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d4bd0e0a263dcd030204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Kennelly","original_name":"Patrick Kennelly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d4e89251417222025019","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997982,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Trevor Baker","original_name":"Trevor Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d5739251415e3c02ce5d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997983,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"WILLIAM HUTSON","original_name":"WILLIAM HUTSON","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8d5980e0a263dc702fc8a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxqYaq7SAuKAJ5pT4AXmkGqFome.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":648},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LfVuFdbrMb0D1kRnRMS7DDQ2ix.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":648}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
