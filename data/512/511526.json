Their grunge chic New York group's divergent backgrounds and views serve to highlight how the pursuit of love, in all its forms and manifestations remains the driving force behind our lives, regardless of age, race, culture, religion or sexual orientation. The journey is punctuated by an original, pulsating soundtrack and live band performances by the all girl group MaxiTit and its faithful lesbian following.","popularity":0.0549,"poster_path":"/TanrY6lIqTYHxsvKLEArTnIDIj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manhattan Minutiae","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Becker","original_name":"Steve Becker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa830c50e0a263dd30285b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0821486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/TanrY6lIqTYHxsvKLEArTnIDIj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
