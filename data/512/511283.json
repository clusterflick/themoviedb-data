Zoo, located in Wynnewood, OK, is the world's largest private zoo featuring over 187 big cats. The zoo is operated by founder Joe Schreibvogel, a.k.a. Joe Exotic, the self-described \"gay, gun-carrying redneck with a mullet.\" Joe and his two husbands live in a small house behind the zoo along with a full-grown African lion, four liger cubs, a kangaroo and family of \"wiener dogs.\" The zoo was named after Joe's brother, \"G.W.\" who loved exotic animals and had always dreamed of traveling to Africa to see lions roaming free. Then tragedy struck, and G.W. was killed by a drunk semi-truck driver. While he lay dying in hospital, his brother Joe promised that he would dedicate his life to protecting the animals that his brother loved. Almost 20 years on, Joe, his partners and the staff at the zoo continue to live the life exotic and honor the commitment made to G.W. But their eccentric and polyamorous lifestyle has made Joe and his zoo the subject of harsh criticisms and controversy.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/92LczX5h8FeJPoV8BqVWNKFfBd1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life Exotic: Or the Incredible True Story of Joe Schreibvogel","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.D.
