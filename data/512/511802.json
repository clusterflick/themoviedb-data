On projection these separate instants are converted simultaneously into picture and sound.The gaps between the dots gradually decrease until a fusion of the material occurs; the separate image-moments coalesce into a pulsating ball of light; simultaneously we hear rhythmic sounds fusing into a continuous rising drone.These transformations are taking place in our perceptual systems, for if we examine the physical strip of film, no such change is seen. Apparently we register time through our optical and our aural senses in very different ways, one chemical, the other mechanical.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":"/vAcgKjv5odNBy1sDafTDL6YzyEN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycles #1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Sherwin","original_name":"Guy Sherwin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/r6otnOKoQjFBlEnOvVQX3J5g2sD.jpg","credit_id":"5aa99a500e0a266da6005480","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2993656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vW5fpW6pQLMJIPX16SlLoEBL9LC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":985,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7ZZkVEXzbcMRsiorYnuMlUHERf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":743},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1516,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vAcgKjv5odNBy1sDafTDL6YzyEN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
