A film about healing after profound loss.  John and Michael pays homage to two men with Down's syndrome who shared an intimate and profoundly loving relationship that deeply affected the filmmaker. Animated with clay backlit on glass, the film shimmers like stained glass in motion. Narrator Brian Davis, also intellectually challenged, brings the men alive with great sensitivity. The audience shares in the various emotions that infuse their everyday living.  John and Michael, by its artistry, rises above society's traditional ideas around disability, sexuality and death. When the heart is touched, differences melt. Love is what defines humanity.","popularity":0.3562,"poster_path":"/23Vl1bVsBWLDX64D3htTkpBsIog.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John and Michael","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Davis","original_name":"Brian Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5aa85e3d0e0a263dc7028ae6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3094003,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Littleton","original_name":"Daniel Littleton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2c186764b99005790518c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3094004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karla Schickele","original_name":"Karla Schickele","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2c19000bfe80058ab4ba8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1975897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luigi Allemano","original_name":"Luigi Allemano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2c1bbe18e3f006fa88d1e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Verrall","original_name":"David Verrall","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2c1d0764b990029dc2616","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shira Avni","original_name":"Shira Avni","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d33b341a561336a25038a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shira Avni","original_name":"Shira Avni","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa8293b0e0a263dcd024f04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Fukushima","original_name":"Michael Fukushima","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa86065925141722201e823","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shira Avni","original_name":"Shira Avni","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa860b40e0a263dcd0293d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1632536","wikidata_id":"Q12125253","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nmwR0McA95jr1cjYcPigBy6lCv4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/51hu3dtmOvsIWRqhKHNyOeL4hfw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2276},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1toKqjDAAR16M1J9H0l0E6odEEm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/23Vl1bVsBWLDX64D3htTkpBsIog.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4573,"name":"down syndrome"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
