In the present day, she applies for the show America’s Got Talent where she performs heavy metal music, through which she wants to pass her wisdom on to the world, as well as to have as much fun as possible at her age. This life-affirming film is made with no special allowances for Igne’s age, which commands much respect.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/ntUEX3IPYGhJlT6bCJEGLSghVCt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
