He's got everything you want from a comic: He's silly, he’s likeable, and he's fun.  With a background in improvisational theater including training at Chicago’s prestigious Second City, as well as the Upright Citizens Brigade in Los Angeles, Johnny brings a very unique style to the stage.  Beehner made his network television debut in January of 2015 as one of the last comedians to appear on the Late Show with David Letterman. He has made numerous appearances on FOX \"Laughs\" television show, and regularly appears on the nationally syndicated Bob & Tom Show.
