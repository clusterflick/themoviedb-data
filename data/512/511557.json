In the aftermath, the teacher’s former students are invited to Hart’s camp for a picnic and a basketball game. Hart and his campmates are both curious and afraid of what awaits them on the basketball court.  Told from Hart’s perspective, The Basketball Game fuses animation, documentary and personal memoir in a poignant and humorous tale of hope and tolerance in the face of fear and stereotypes.","popularity":0.0716,"poster_path":"/iy0tt5VG8KsemrbowBbxQeJFSdf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Basketball Game","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hart Snider","original_name":"Hart Snider","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa839c30e0a263dcd026dee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2146840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i0yien7NwJRQXVKvrmesiF5f2AL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iy0tt5VG8KsemrbowBbxQeJFSdf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
