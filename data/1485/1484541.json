He also blows the whistle on the chaos of late-night customer service at his favorite retailers. With the veteran storytelling skills of a seasoned comic—and former collegiate wrestler—Greg revisits the coach who’s been living rent-free in his head for over 30 years. Yes, high school fishing teams are real. So are their cheerleaders. And with a routine you won’t forget, The Champ sticks the landing and scores big laughs.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/c176wQMTpu4v7HLnu5uQfWkXD7H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211824,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Nateland
