The two sides of her personality seemed to belong to separate worlds, until the day she decided to unite them: Mabel abandoned the world of performance as a drag queen to intervene in Sebastián's reality at the faculty. Her emergence not only represents a big step for her, but she and her friends will decide to show up at the faculty to make visible the reality of many people within this educational institution: they need to put their bodies on the line. Queerness, gayness, and dissidents need to come out and be shown in a space where, until now, they have rarely been shown. Mabel, as a representative of all these people, will decide to fight for her place within the educational field.\r Premiered at the Mar del Plata International Film Festival 33rd edition, third prize winner of the Georges Méliès Competition.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mabel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5452906,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valeria Medina (vera del monte)","original_name":"Valeria Medina (vera del monte)","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682dddb9e19cab56120be1ca","department":"Writing","job":"Screenstory"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
