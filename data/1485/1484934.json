The film begins with a simple question: What can the artist offer when the images of our time overwhelm the capacity of frames to contain them? In the wake of the ongoing genocide in Gaza—live-streamed by its perpetrators and rendered unbearable in its clarity—Ghalamdar burns over 50 of his own paintings, works exhibited in solo and group shows across renowned institutions worldwide.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sight is a Wound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5452904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Parham Ghalamdar","original_name":"Parham Ghalamdar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682ddd8e4321d6b1069e4216","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
