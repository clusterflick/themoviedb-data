A rich collection of images of marches, rallies, footage from detention centers, and hundreds of photographs enrich the narrative. The story is told and presented like a giant puzzle, where dozens of voices tell us about the search for their families, how they fought, how they resisted, and how today that pain has been transformed into creative energy in the search for truth and justice.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nadie olvida nada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
