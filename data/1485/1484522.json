These materials are assembled, via a hand-built web editor, into a new kind of \"annotated film\" that links to online archival sources. Drawing in form from the video lecture-performance style honed on CAMP's rooftop cinema and studio that takes its audience on dense archival journeys, the work examines a \"poor man's colony\" that was set up in the 1950s and destroyed twenty-five years later to make room for an atomic research facility in Bombay.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Janata Colony to Janata Colony (imaginary to destroyed)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shaina Anand","original_name":"Shaina Anand","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682cace25dc9100908f56552","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ashok Sukumaran","original_name":"Ashok Sukumaran","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682cacf000d1cec6c1db31b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
