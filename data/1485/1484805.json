One day, her usual and ordinary practice of drawing panoramas became extraordinary when a mysterious young woman obstructed Joy’s view. Lavender, a visiting violinist, stays in town to perform onstage a week later. Lavender finds the beach comforting to rehearse her notes. The beach, as a setting, became a turning point for both artists to parallel their enthusiasm in the arts and music.  As Joy and Lavender spend more time together, their bond deepens, and Joy finds herself increasingly drawn towards Lavender. With the violinist’s performance coming closer, Joy begins to question whether her connection with Lavender is genuine or just a fleeting moment in time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to Lavender","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
