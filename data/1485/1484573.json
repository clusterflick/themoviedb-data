In an effort to document the human reality of war, Rubén Díez (Lethal Crysis), one of the most influential Spanish-speaking travel and exploration content creators, and Ignacio Marín, a renowned photojournalist specializing in war zones, traveled to the heart of the conflict in December 2024 to capture the experiences of those who resist in the shadows.  For two weeks, they visited trenches, evacuation points, rehabilitation centers, and front lines, meeting soldiers, doctors, civilians, and refugees who shared their daily lives in a world where normalcy has been destroyed. Through intimate encounters and raw testimonies, this feature-length documentary offers an honest, unfiltered look at the human capacity to adapt, resist, and carry on—even in the darkest of settings.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/hcsFFiE8H2kFuMemumofZAcUbii.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262920,"logo_path":null,"name":"LETHAL CRYSIS","origin_country":""},{"id":258489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feral Stories","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2025-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ucrania: OBLIGADOS A SOBREVIVIR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Díez","original_name":"Rubén Díez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Lethal Crysis","credit_id":"682ccd715211a914f28c0dea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaroslav","original_name":"Yaroslav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Yaroslav","credit_id":"682cd453bb2a3d77b7f56492","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Díez","original_name":"Rubén Díez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682cc826d5b21f6368649669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ignacio marín","original_name":"Ignacio marín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682cc8cb1454889f4b8c0e65","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451324,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iaroslav Oliinyk","original_name":"Iaroslav Oliinyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682cc91235f496326e64954a","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451329,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ginés Jimena","original_name":"Ginés Jimena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682ccb8c03dc7f4ef2db32e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5451332,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"D.
