When he notices that his neighbour, the unemployed Fung, is struggling to make ends meet with a pregnant wife about to give birth, he secretly delivers food to help them. Out of desperation, Fung takes a risk and attempts to steal from their neighbour, dancer Lily, only to stumble upon a crime scene—Lily has just been murdered by the ruthless villain Robert. Fung immediately becomes the primary suspect of the case. Having witnessed everything, Shing reports the truth to the police inspector, but is ignored due to his reputation for lying. Fung flees to the outskirts of the city, where Shing continues to provide him with food in secret. Wracked by guilt and fear, Robert, seeks to silence both Shing and Fung for good, but fortunately, Shing’s quick thinking allows them to escape. His actions raise suspicion from the inspector, leading to a tense battle of wits and strength between Shing, Fung, Robert, and the police.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/xLlrZlBOTp30sIwVbyNSf3O1EZS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kong Ngee","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1958-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Catch a Thief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"The Brilliant Boy Who Caught the Thief","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"The Prodigy Who Caught a Thief","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"神童捉贼记","type":"Mandarin"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lai Siu-Tin","original_name":"黎小田","popularity":1.0445,"profile_path":"/8A3P7d97n2pcBZPcnTbY3QUZaeL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sing","credit_id":"682db28c5613abdd990be435","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Tse Yin","original_name":"謝賢","popularity":1.6494,"profile_path":"/5neIbXmuvtdQIygHu6D2wighYwW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Ching","credit_id":"682db29ff43368e0f5e259bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nam Hung","original_name":"南紅","popularity":0.9329,"profile_path":"/mT28BYk2VjixjMKVLkWXEp9hYS5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Ching","credit_id":"682db2e3de6c434d038c1216","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keung Chung-Ping","original_name":"Keung Chung-Ping","popularity":0.9808,"profile_path":"/fDcMsdLB6ICeQoHWT46fjRucR76.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"682db493da43493afddb3563","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1699282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Suk-Hing","original_name":"Leung Suk-Hing","popularity":0.4931,"profile_path":"/hTAoUKhUHv8oP6frO4zvXSUErL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mother Ching","credit_id":"682db5079c392c1e61f5681c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Pang-Fei","original_name":"Lee Pang-Fei","popularity":1.3847,"profile_path":"/anQskwwtirj1wUgYSIGn45GV76J.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Detective","credit_id":"682db51ac78f4532bf2f7f72","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fung Ming","original_name":"Fung Ming","popularity":0.4474,"profile_path":"/kafXbUrtsq2PU4GmkEg28bHTx3R.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sergeant","credit_id":"682db53029b78a28ca8c1169","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4441633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Man Chan","original_name":"Man Chan","popularity":0.1963,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682db32ad5e676ea920be357","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5452626,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fai Tung","original_name":"Fai Tung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682db353f7e538f8302f7f79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ho Tai-Yip","original_name":"Ho Tai-Yip","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682db47df5cbf1d861e25562","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0798441","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/xLlrZlBOTp30sIwVbyNSf3O1EZS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1958-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
