John Copley’s acclaimed English National Opera production was restaged in studio, skilfully using all the technical advantages offered, to create this top quality recording. The opera was first performed in 1724 at the Haymarket Theatre in London using castrati singers in the heroes’ roles. This production follows modern practice in using women in these parts. Dame Janet’s virtuoso role as Julius Caesar has been heralded as a masterful recreation of the music which Handel wrote for the finest singers of his time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4S6aVzscUAl1l4eBqIwAgdqJV0a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":179,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Gulio Cesare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Michael Phillips","original_name":"John Michael Phillips","popularity":0.5317,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682c9b82005c09508a8c0f41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4S6aVzscUAl1l4eBqIwAgdqJV0a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"JULIUS CAESAR - George Frideric Handel (Trailer) | Janet Baker | English National Opera","key":"CFqyMPihE9c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-20T13:30:05.000Z","id":"682c9b672a2629ff022f1072"}]}}}
