Vasil Levski, the Bulgarian national hero, arrives in a small town to organize the revolutionary committee. However, Turkish authorities discover the meeting, forcing the conspirators to scatter. A local schoolteacher, Hristina, who is in love with Levski, becomes a target of Turkish spies alongside the priest Nikola, a secret supporter of the revolution. Both are arrested and brutally tortured, as is Levski’s mother, who is thrown into a well. Disguised, Levski closely follows the posse hunting him and manages to overcome numerous dangers to rescue Hristina. Meanwhile, the blinded priest continues to pray for his enslaved people. Suddenly, a miracle occurs — church bells ring on their own, inspiring hope and signaling that liberation is near.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buntat na robite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0287947","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
