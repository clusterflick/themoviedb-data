Using sound and text as underlying maps of events and situations, choreographer and artistic director Bebe Miller focuses on the subtle interactions of gesture, timing, focus, and dynamics that are uniquely human yet often illegible outside of recognizable contexts. In a Rhythm works to decipher the “unfamiliar” and pushes to cultivate a new sense of shared understanding for looking at the world around us.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/A30O6QAPhhLU8HwElC36zVaoj3g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In
