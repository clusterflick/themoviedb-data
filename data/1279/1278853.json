But first the Woodwalker Council must decide whether or not Carag's mentor and patron of the school, Andrew Milling, should be found guilty of the attack on the humans. Carag is in a dilemma: he wants to put a stop to Milling, but he promises to bring him to his true cougar family if he covers for him in front of the council. Carag decides to lie for Milling in order to finally see his family again and reconcile with his father. When it soon emerges that the school is in danger and that Milling has a hand in this too to further his political career, Carag and his friends have to find proof fast! Of all people, the snow she-wolf Tikaani comes to Carag's aid.
