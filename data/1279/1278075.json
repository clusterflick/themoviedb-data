It is conceived as a surreal anti-patriarchal thought experiment and raises important questions about gender, power, and social change, prompting us to reflect on how historical patterns of discrimination and oppression might be either repeated or overcome in a reversed gendered world. It challenges the viewer to confront their own assumptions and biases, and to consider the possibilities of a more equitable society.","popularity":0.5653,"poster_path":"/ppPq28lV0OCRLLtQz8MhDjWsjXO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demi-Goddesses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Gerigk","original_name":"Martin Gerigk","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6625ef7f62f335017dda8242","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Gerigk","original_name":"Martin Gerigk","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fc8311f0275012714e54b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Gerigk","original_name":"Martin Gerigk","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fc83e8a88b20124cedfb6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259443,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nikola Gocić","original_name":"Nikola Gocić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662fc86869d280012943a9b0","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gtOBsk6TjSMzFCRrXBe4cdSBibE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ppPq28lV0OCRLLtQz8MhDjWsjXO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":3131,"name":"modern society"},{"id":6337,"name":"patriarchy"},{"id":10777,"name":"goddess"},{"id":33416,"name":"power politics"},{"id":158455,"name":"oppression"},{"id":200690,"name":"matriarchy"},{"id":208226,"name":"video collage"},{"id":224230,"name":"collage film"},{"id":234887,"name":"women dominated society"},{"id":246413,"name":"gender studies"},{"id":246414,"name":"women and society"},{"id":260283,"name":"german"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":281741,"name":"nudity"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":297850,"name":"social equity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
