Younger and Older are adult siblings who have just lost their mother to terminal illness. Younger has sunk into a grief where she intrusively relives the last perfect day the three of them had together: on the beach, with the rushing of the sea underscoring impermanence. When Older has to leave Younger alone for the first time since the memorial, Younger's surreal, sensory grief threatens to drown her. She must turn into the swell and face it, accepting the help and love of her family - both here and gone - to resurface.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rushing of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3998906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Jane Schiller","original_name":"Isabella Jane Schiller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Younger","credit_id":"6627f7bd176a94017f82235e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2384978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Martineck","original_name":"Dani Martineck","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Older","credit_id":"6627f7ce62f3350164d9f0f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4670981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katelynn Kenney","original_name":"Katelynn Kenney","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hallway Neighbor","credit_id":"6627f7d963d937016473764d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4670982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney McClellan","original_name":"Courtney McClellan","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hallway Neighbor","credit_id":"6627f7e4221ba6016314c721","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4670984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Karna","original_name":"Molly Karna","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627f7f562f3350164d9f10e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2384978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Martineck","original_name":"Dani Martineck","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627f8122e2b2c01876a3b65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2464189,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Austin Lee Smoak","original_name":"Austin Lee Smoak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627f86b62f335014bd85339","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3998906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Jane Schiller","original_name":"Isabella Jane Schiller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627f81d2e2b2c01876a3b6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2384978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dani Martineck","original_name":"Dani Martineck","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627f7fe4a4bf60188769c90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846163,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ya-Ting \"Itchy\" Yang","original_name":"Ya-Ting \"Itchy\" Yang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2jIVsbP23PSlVM9IcdnejKHewMV.jpg","credit_id":"6627f8c5cb6db50163afbce0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":988651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amy Sewell","original_name":"Amy Sewell","popularity":0.1888,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627f842af95900164697334","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
