This unique ensemble owes its existence to the vision of its founder, Sir Georg Solti, who believed passionately in peace and the power of music and musicians to be ambassadors for peace. Charmingly hosted by Solti’s widow, Lady Valerie Solti, and featuring soloists such as Angela Gheorghiu and René Pape as well as members of the Georg Solti Accademia, this memorable evening presents musical highlights, all of which played a significant role in Solti’s life and career. Conductor Valery Gergiev was a good friend of his advisor Georg Solti. Together with Lady Valerie Solti and the World Orchestra for Peace he carries on Solti’s vision and maintains his memory.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/zEU1utojICSO8O83OvLQGpo18MV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solti Centenary Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":262687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Gheorghiu","original_name":"Angela Gheorghiu","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/tmgmVyEDOQugjUJX2u14JTqLjqk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"soprano","credit_id":"662648ef2dda890187e3a38b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"bass","credit_id":"662648ff2dda890187e3a3a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tereza Gevorgyan","original_name":"Tereza Gevorgyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"soprano","credit_id":"66264912eb79c2017ed4bc79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilda Paulsson","original_name":"Matilda Paulsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"mezzo-soprano","credit_id":"6626492acb5c8e018741c70d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roberto Carlos Gomez Ortiz","original_name":"Roberto Carlos Gomez Ortiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"tenor","credit_id":"66264939b2681f017c735e82","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Ramgobin","original_name":"Ross Ramgobin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"baritone","credit_id":"6626495e63e6fb017efcdbbd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valery Gergiev","original_name":"Valery Gergiev","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/gn4dLa8vF0fdONol4hiHstSfK40.jpg","credit_id":"662648cf2588230164916c92","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zEU1utojICSO8O83OvLQGpo18MV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
