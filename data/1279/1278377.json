Noah, Noah deals with relationships, distance, and memories, and turns the needs and desires that evolve from them into a cinematic experience. Trains departing, back roads roamed, navigating by water or air. It’s also about distance in filming, a distance from one image to another film roll, from one frame to another perforation, the distance from the real to the faded memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noah, Noah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Wu Chun-Hui","original_name":"吳俊輝","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dUqJiOBSTOfVGmbyO6x4Qk9aYL4.jpg","credit_id":"66269bb6b2681f01a9750246","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
