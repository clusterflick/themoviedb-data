From triggers around ignorant teaching at an early age, difficulties with over-stimulation and anxieties with socialising, these three skaters show us the trials of finding a personal balance outside the wider population's grasp of routine behaviour.","popularity":0.0599,"poster_path":"/1BHg044Q9HdQTGxHZVdKf8mnGVf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THREE NEURODIVERGENT SKATERS OPEN UP ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLES AND THEIR MOMENTS OF PEACE","title":"Seeking Comfort In An Uncomfortable Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4368225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debora Maité","original_name":"Debora Maité","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627782963e6fb014bfbe9ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1BHg044Q9HdQTGxHZVdKf8mnGVf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
