It includes Richard Strauss’s self-confidently impressive Don Juan, sumptuous songs by Alban Berg, Ravel’s overwhelmingly sensual song cycle Shéhérazade and finally Stravinsky’s both groundbreaking and nostalgic Petrushka. The star guest is the Latvian mezzosoprano Elina Garanca.","popularity":0.1411,"poster_path":"/tZG10mJqkWx8O1DfpG20uPVmmZf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berliner Philharmoniker: Sir Simon Rattle & Elina Garanca in Baden-Baden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":471356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Garanca","original_name":"Elina Garanca","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/2xLi7RtxE1j2FQMuaXvVXkRjIr2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"mezzo-soprano","credit_id":"66276ffc29c626017e4a3d80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"orchestra","credit_id":"6627700e29c626016549e85d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nele Münchmeyer","original_name":"Nele Münchmeyer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627702d7a97ab01638e0809","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rattle","original_name":"Simon Rattle","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/erFlB9B08lVMhEj70bLUpkr28iA.jpg","credit_id":"6627704029c626016549e867","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZG10mJqkWx8O1DfpG20uPVmmZf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
