Although accepted as a brilliant mind with a sharp intellect to solve crimes, he is often chided for his immature, casanova-personality. During the course of time, Vikram courts many brickbats and transfers in his career. He serves in the traffic department as well as the Law and order department. However, when an inmate Raja escapes from prison, Vikram is called back in to track him down.  The movie was produced by Raghavendra Rajkumar, the younger brother of Shivarajkumar under Nikileshwari Cine Combines. The core plot of the movie was inspired by Eddie Macon's - RUN.
