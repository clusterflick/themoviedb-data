His voyage offers an opportunity for reflection on humanity's impact on the environment and serves as a reminder of the devastating ecological disaster on the Odra River. Amidst the sounds of nature, the protagonist seeks hope for a future where ecological balance prevails, not only for himself and his daughter but also for the world. Dive into the primal symphony of the river, momentarily escaping the chaos of modern
