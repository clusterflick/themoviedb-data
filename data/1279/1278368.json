Retracing the steps of a whirlwind courtship, struggles to date again, and regular visits to his dedicated doctor (Kathy Hsieh) only intensify the flashbacks of his lost love (Ryan Higgins) and his younger self (Adam Michael Waldo). Victor finds a new perspective (through music) to the scar he must continually learn to accept –and live with.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still I Reach For You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4668785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor A.
