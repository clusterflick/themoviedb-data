While flying too high and being too free he burned his fingers and now the viewers can decide themselves whether Jan has enouth will and power to rise from the ashes. Only Jan's friend Margus Ott has survived in today's desinfected and chlorinated pool of education among the former philosophy students of the School of Humanities. The documentary points out the commercialization of today's higher education and suffocation of free thinking. The protagonists' journey reveals how educational system attempts to cast creative thinkers into similar moulds.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/ywAaMORLtf0ZVZok8Q5FO6sBMob.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rühm Pluss Null","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space of Pure Thought","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2485877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vahur-Paul Põldma","original_name":"Vahur-Paul Põldma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fMwejARalf9CUMUUSAw8wxfhfvv.jpg","credit_id":"66264273258823017d92c2a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2AvAj3QJzjkjUtv3zvllWn9O0Ku.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2QUA15Ho4uuCENrcrUE3YeCoju.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":951,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/ywAaMORLtf0ZVZok8Q5FO6sBMob.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":671}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"et","note":"Kino Artis","release_date":"2015-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PUHTA MÕTTE RUUM / Treiler 2 min","key":"yo5BrUy1_4k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-27T12:51:03.000Z","id":"662642f22dda890149e083b1"}]}}}
