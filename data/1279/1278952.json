They play joyfully under the gaze of an astronaut father who tries to immortalise them before his long journey into space. However, it's an expedition of no return. Following in their parents' footsteps and armed with toys, the children experience a blissful world, tailored to humans, and they grow up confident in their ability to conquer it. The stars become reachable, all animals are at their disposal. The earth rumbles beneath them and the fumes of a volcano become menacing. But the protagonists of this story don't seem to realize that they are ghosts trapped in a scratched film. Perhaps, only due to a matter of diopters.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":"/nXtSKyFoSmis4AQ1eScDb3XXc56.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Matter of Diopters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Matter of Diopters","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4195460,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Davide Maria Valsecchi","original_name":"Davide Maria Valsecchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6627e33e4a4bf601887696ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nXtSKyFoSmis4AQ1eScDb3XXc56.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
