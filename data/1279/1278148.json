In order to protect children's innocence and artistry, this time he want to convey music. With 50 ukuleles supported by a Korean cultural foundation, he leaves for Madagascar with composer Taehwa Jang and 14 volunteers. Although they are poor, they live with a positive outlook on life. The children, who find everything amazing, are absorbed in ukulele lessons and choir practice despite the hot weather. The beautiful performances and singing of a 50-member ukulele troupe and a 100-member choir resonate movingly at Trinity School, the beach, and Baobab Street in Morondava, Madagascar.
