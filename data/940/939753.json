The band had never played a live show before this tour and the documentary unveils an emotional, hilarious and nerve-wracking story of how this seemingly impossible dream became a reality.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raj Against the Machine (The Documentary)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMH9ESEzHsi7aJFUH5g3r9lvqSV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bloodywood - Raj Against the Machine (The Documentary)","key":"HIvzfULOJ70","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-22T14:00:11.000Z","id":"620dcdeb6ee3d7001c66b230"}]}}}
