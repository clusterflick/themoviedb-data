Handing a tiny omnidirectional camera from one to another and transforming it into an instrument to explore wondrous parallel universes, the children-filmmakers lead us on a mesmerizing adventure of perception. Their ingenuity evokes both the ideal of an eye unconstrained by habits of perspective and the utopia of a cinema freed from technology by means of technology itself. Thanks to a lyrical intertwining of ethnography, play and reverie, the film becomes a touching invitation to reimagine entanglements among humans, nonhumans, and the world surrounding them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Handing a tiny omnidirectional camera from one to another and transforming it into an instrument to explore wondrous parallel universes, the children-filmmakers lead us on a mesmerizing adventure of perception.","title":"In the Garden of Forking Paths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Rapisarda Casanova","original_name":"Simone Rapisarda Casanova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620cc11866eba7001be5d49d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3429039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dara Culhane","original_name":"Dara Culhane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620cc124c048a9001b066162","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
