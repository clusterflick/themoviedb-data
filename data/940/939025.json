The elder sister was plain and attractive, but possessing a patriotic spirit and sterling qualities. The younger sister was pretty and doll-like, superficial, frivolous and fond of luxury. The elder sister was capable of a deep and undying devotion, while the younger was only capable of shallow affection. Both of the sisters love the neighbor in their separate ways. He is sub-consciously attracted by the inner worth of the elder sister, but this attraction is overbalanced by the beauty of the younger.","popularity":0.3102,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bison Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women and War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Boy","credit_id":"620bd3831bf876004246f3ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1156970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Bush","original_name":"Pauline Bush","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/xvnLUGdgalYCKhtngNfxdK6VbLr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Older Sister","credit_id":"620bd3931bf876004246f40f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1630415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessalyn Van Trump","original_name":"Jessalyn Van Trump","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/q7458RVuUfH1NGmpgsTEVsnkWxX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Younger Sister","credit_id":"620bd3a190dde0006d48cb8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marshall Neilan","original_name":"Marshall Neilan","popularity":0.3403,"profile_path":"/aoDM0HGWdOUypvrzaEizl8a8d3i.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Stay-at-home","credit_id":"620bd3b890dde0006d48cbc4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Dwan","original_name":"Allan Dwan","popularity":0.2253,"profile_path":"/kAvLKEkjOpOzQSEpvFrjF0b5Nq9.jpg","credit_id":"620bd367f03174006d63697b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","credit_id":"620bd372245dbe0020c962e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003567","wikidata_id":"Q3569767","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
