Interviews from the 1960s and 70s reveal the mutual loathing that came to a head when, against all expectations, they starred together in the classic psychological thriller Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. The programme looks in detail at the making of the film, examines the fallout when Bette and not Joan received an Oscar nomination for her performance, and shows how, despite the hatred, the pair had more in common than audiences appreciated.","popularity":0.3742,"poster_path":"/nS0FmEAWeuLheUs06pHtKQJZqXV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bette and Joan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Talking Pictures - Betty & Joan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Syms","original_name":"Sylvia Syms","popularity":0.3554,"profile_path":"/itv1B0z5unMZ8VQ6nrCfn2dxf98.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"620be5a10328b90056b6a6cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bette Davis","original_name":"Bette Davis","popularity":1.9691,"profile_path":"/uBRNCljWHEG9cW9em2ZyoGWQQN5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"620be5ca88b14800562e41e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Crawford","original_name":"Joan Crawford","popularity":1.0427,"profile_path":"/AtEGacmejG86ug8tKTxFd7JbJJO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"620be5f0aad9c201ae576cdb","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7950604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nS0FmEAWeuLheUs06pHtKQJZqXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
