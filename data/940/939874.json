Gestures, articulation, mutual understanding declare themselves with a high degree of ambivalence. The characters in this story discover the hidden meaning of physicality and community in the biomechanics of insect metamorphoses, in the signs of atypical manifestations of nature and sexuality that organize the connections of the human and non-human. A sect, a beehive, or a love triangle are just landmarks and markings for trying to understand what is happening. At these moments, the friends' journey, which does not portend anything important, marks out new horizons of an impossible community - a community of keeping apart.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":102867,"logo_path":"/mlIBTCf8DzAOfoBt9VgjA8iB8YA.png","name":"Moscow School of New Cinema","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IN_SECTDAY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polina Dvoretskaya","original_name":"Polina Dvoretskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e36292975ca001ba8ab0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spirit Of Fire International Festival Of Cinematographic Debuts","release_date":"2022-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
