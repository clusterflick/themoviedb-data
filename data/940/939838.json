As in the case of 8-mm, the last and most important goal of this work is not a story, not a story, not an illusion of presence or a desire to convey, comprehend reality, but the creation of a sequence of artistic images on the screen that suits the author, the creation of an artificial flow, rhythm, music of images. He considers his \"cinematic\" activity as a natural continuation of the musical, its integral part. This is his personal large-scale research driven by a thirst for enjoyment of rhythmic changes of various shapes and colors.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kCN9ffPVr9aNUNDMwQKXQvBmaF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Center of Your Absence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"V tsentre tvoego otsutstviya","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Sysoev","original_name":"Alexey Sysoev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e207d70309f001b49657e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kCN9ffPVr9aNUNDMwQKXQvBmaF1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spirit Of Fire International Festival Of Cinematographic Debuts","release_date":"2022-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
