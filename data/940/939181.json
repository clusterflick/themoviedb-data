Such places concretize dreams and consequences of queer-dom in the 20th century and beyond (see Pulse slaughter, 2016). Stonewall itself is modeled here based on first person accounts of the iconic bar, where against the full-moon early morning hours of June 28, 1969, queers raged against oppression. They threw pennies, bricks, beer bottles, a trash-can, and a parking meter. In the video they, we, and those tools of rebellion dance, affirming that past, present & future, celebration and protest, are not mutually exclusive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wzQNjcncToM1lVn0PH1mCG1VIkL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Stonewall in My Navel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Beckman","original_name":"Laurel Beckman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620c2789b458b8006d470889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12697930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wzQNjcncToM1lVn0PH1mCG1VIkL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Burnt Video Art and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
