In Charles’ words, the film “shows something of the special and rare situations that existed when these two cultures came together…one very sophisticated, one with a highly developed technology.” The soundtrack juxtaposes the visuals, with music from the album “Banjo Kings,” an early-American fife-and-drum recording from the Smithsonian Institution archives, and traditional Japanese music from tapes provided by the Japanese embassy.","popularity":0.1919,"poster_path":"/2lCT0sOLFmUfnAaenwCsqVOzoIt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Ships","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Eames","original_name":"Charles Eames","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/nLh3r0QomqDHKdi1cjOwnUC8uJe.jpg","credit_id":"620bdce7ae6f09002d9aaf32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Eames","original_name":"Ray Eames","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/jILIR1qMthTLZ93meHnnzw0vLrg.jpg","credit_id":"620bdcf4ae6f09002d9aaf78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0297795","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1725,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2lCT0sOLFmUfnAaenwCsqVOzoIt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1150}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Jan 1 is a substitute, year is correct","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
