Like the characters in a Beckett play, they are in an endless wait at an empty bus stop, and the language and cultural gap turn the conversation into an absurd, but characteristic of today's situation of \"non-communication\". Translation difficulties are a convenient excuse for ignoring those who are nearby and going into cultural escapism. Is it possible to bridge this gap and make the other hear you?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/A5cpHWw07P5mcQ22VMMTLT1gqpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rodchenko School","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bridge The Gap","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Preodolevaya razryv","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Artemenko","original_name":"Elena Artemenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e35610f1e5800433c9750","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A5cpHWw07P5mcQ22VMMTLT1gqpW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bridge the gap / Trailer","key":"442619023","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-29T07:36:59.000Z","id":"6216b5101065d3006f3d0530"}]}}}
