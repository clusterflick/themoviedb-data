This is a story about how a real bullying was born out of one innocent joke on a classmate. Blood, tears, remorse – there is practically no such thing in the film. There is only a premonition of tragedy, a hint of violence and the search for the \"extreme\"... and a teacher, a class teacher who could change everything, but did not dare or did not want to.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qGePrMPyb07lDgNlh11VobukHnq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Igor - Chair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Soldatov","original_name":"Konstantin Soldatov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e2d004e52ed0044837d46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qGePrMPyb07lDgNlh11VobukHnq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
