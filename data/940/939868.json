The narrative follows Ting-hao as he reflects on how his political idealism fits in with everyday political reality and ponders Taiwan’s complex political landscape, Taiwan’s relations with a meddlesome yet surprisingly indifferent China, and the perspectives of Matsu residents on Taiwan-China affairs.","popularity":0.2482,"poster_path":"/1HBFdM8GSLUsUCfOVmWBmzaeZzu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2082212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiang Wei-hua","original_name":"Chiang Wei-hua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e48e30f1e58001b51320b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2082212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiang Wei-hua","original_name":"Chiang Wei-hua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e49880f1e58001b513355","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2082212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiang Wei-hua","original_name":"Chiang Wei-hua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620e495a0f1e5800433cbc71","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21231288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/1HBFdM8GSLUsUCfOVmWBmzaeZzu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9322,"name":"taiwan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
