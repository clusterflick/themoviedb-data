The film explores semi-abandoned villages, where the few remaining inhabitants face an uncertain future, devoid of hope. The “Khasham Neshi- nan,” nomadic tent dwellers living in half-stone, half-tent shelters, are weary with age, while the younger generation has forsaken their herding traditions for grueling work in the stone mines to the south. Through the lens of this desolate landscape, Bakhtegan Wetland becomes a grim reflection of nature’s collapse—an ecological tragedy that humankind remains blind to, despite its devastating impact.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5TStdc1keljDwaHDKaugIadP7NX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luckless Lake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Luckless Lake: Bakhtegan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4980208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faraz Fadaian","original_name":"Faraz Fadaian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ffca7cfa3e69e0ef7cbf86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5TStdc1keljDwaHDKaugIadP7NX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Apricot Tree Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ethnokino Bern","release_date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
