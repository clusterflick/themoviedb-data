Set in modern-day Israel, this moving documentary explores two entwined storylines that converge in Fira's life.\r Fira's harrowing past is unveiled as she recounts her family's escape from a burning Europe with the help of a kind Polish woman. We witness her resilience and strength in the face of adversity, and how her experiences have shaped her life today.\r In the present, Fira is dependent on the kindness of Firita's mother, Magna, who serves as her caretaker for the past 12 years. Through her intricate and poignant present, we see the deep bond Fira shares with Firita, who embodies the future and a symbol of hope.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lZ6ii92oqpr9FEnM7qZGzCVchQC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruth Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oy Mama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Maiman","original_name":"Noa Maiman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"670153e6e84eeb35a0f8565e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Maiman","original_name":"Noa Maiman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670153ffc9a10d46ea7d1220","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orna Ben-Dor Niv","original_name":"Orna Ben-Dor Niv","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6701540bc9a10d46ea7d122a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569937,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Deddy Tzur","original_name":"Deddy Tzur","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67015422e84eeb35a0f85670","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4982370,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomer Eliav","original_name":"Tomer Eliav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67015441c9a10d46ea7d1257","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3151497,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yariv Mor","original_name":"Yariv Mor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67015628c9a10d46ea7d12b6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4982382,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alon Wohlfeiler-Kahati","original_name":"Alon Wohlfeiler-Kahati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670156be925fdf925b7d0fab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Maiman","original_name":"Noa Maiman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670156d1b146282f7b855acd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2538292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZ6ii92oqpr9FEnM7qZGzCVchQC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
