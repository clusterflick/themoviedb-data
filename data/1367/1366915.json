For example, if a mother doesn’t remember her birthday, how can she find it? For example, when an old aunt looks at her son who has been paralyzed in bed for forty years, who will take care of him? For example, if an uncle who misses his wife confides in front of her grave, will he get a response? For example, the hard-working sister-in-law hopes that the day of no more domestic violence and a better life will come sooner... In this invisible web of love, everyone carries their own obsessions and strives to fight against forgetfulness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fadings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4983256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"You Wenhu","original_name":"You Wenhu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67020f7afa3e69e0ef7d1fbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Mi Ying Hui May Screening","release_date":"2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
