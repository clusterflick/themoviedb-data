Ngai Mun also acted in this film. Wang (Cheung Ying) worked himself to an early death. His wife Ching (Hung Sin Nui) raised their three children all by herself. Eldest son Kei (also played by Cheung Ying) was spoiled and grew up to be a robber. Middle child, daughter Ching-han, is materialistic and vain, and is later killed by Kei. Youngest son Leung (Yeung Fan) is diligent and ambitious, a great comfort to Ching. Hung Sin Nui played Ching from a young to an elderly woman, showing off her practiced, perfect acting skills. Chun Kim’s detailed portrayal of the relationship between the two generations set the stage for his later work Parents’ Hearts (1955).","popularity":0.3458,"poster_path":"/lbDf0WeTkM8bO2nRo0aYplKRDhB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong
