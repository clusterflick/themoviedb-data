It is the only place left in Denmark where an otherwise extinct life form still exists. Where everybody knows everybody, and where fishing skills are passed on from father to son. The way it has always been. It is a tough and harsh life. The young fishermen head out to sea, while the older wait on shore, hoping for the big catch. Many myths about the sea are told here, as well as stories about life, and the ancient struggle with nature is always present.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aside the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sine Skibsholt","original_name":"Sine Skibsholt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67005d02fa3e69e0ef7cdc3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2239666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Senia Dremstrup","original_name":"Senia Dremstrup","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/x1Bja9AZ8CkFI8XhRnmaS04ZcvZ.jpg","credit_id":"67005d13f878adfed0853e13","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2048225,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian Curt Petersen","original_name":"Brian Curt Petersen","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/b2X3Dq3NNW3OvOhGWYa2ZeqOnf0.jpg","credit_id":"67005d21c9a10d46ea7ce763","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5229088","wikidata_id":"Q21040932","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dagmar, Metropol (Ã…rhus)","release_date":"2011-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
