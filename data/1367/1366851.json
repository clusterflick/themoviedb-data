Photographs of paintings and sculptures from museums around the world including the Galleria Borghese, Louvre, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Prado flow seamlessly with images of Goldin’s community, crossing centuries to resonate in harmony with each other, revealing uncanny resemblances in composition, color, form, and emotional tone. Goldin’s ability to draw such precise visual connections raises profound questions about traditional hierarchies within art, and the enduring human compulsion to memorialize beauty in works fueled by love, and grief. — Gagosian","popularity":0.0372,"poster_path":"/AbX4Q28XZAesJTf6N7KzUhPDIsr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stendhal Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1339289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan Goldin","original_name":"Nan Goldin","popularity":0.1905,"profile_path":"/emNf04TFb1sDPdbrYaJe43QnLXN.jpg","credit_id":"6701ca0db146282f7b85728f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Jr3jyx2xd0HKafYVdr3U2PRC1r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1907,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AbX4Q28XZAesJTf6N7KzUhPDIsr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1271}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
