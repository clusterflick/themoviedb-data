At over 60 years old, she is intimately familiar with the paths and hidden corners where healing plants emerge. She is also no stranger to living under threat. Her home is nestled within one of the hamlets that make up the Chaparrí Natural Reserve, one of the last protected forests in northern Peru.​\r ​\r Land traffickers have reached even this remote sanctuary, subjecting her and her fellow members of the Muchik Santa Catalina de Chongoyape Peasant Community to constant threats, beatings, and abuse. Yet, Etelvina's resolve remains unbroken. She refuses to abandon the land she fights for—a land that represents the hope and lifeblood of her family, her community, her friends, and an entire region.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/jdm8WEFCTHEtjZZPziB3gc1CuYN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2024-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Guardian of Gaia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3313021,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lady Vinces Cruz","original_name":"Lady Vinces Cruz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ffbd00e84eeb35a0f80a2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jdm8WEFCTHEtjZZPziB3gc1CuYN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":558}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ethnokino Bern","release_date":"2024-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
