Saulius considers things left at home as junk that needs to be thrown away, while Auksė sees them as memories that shape her entirely different view of the past. Guided by her new-found perspective, Auksė tries to convince her father to reconsider the sale. But the cold relationship between them and the ongoing silent mourning lead to a confrontation where neither side is completely right.","popularity":0.8273,"poster_path":"/tI4xjbnfnYO2J7EtmXDHc4EZDOI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158003,"logo_path":"/58rlz0a17BkLfJKDPEvngC3O4DB.png","name":"Lithuanian Academy of Music and
