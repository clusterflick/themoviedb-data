A young Catholic nun in a convent in Colombo, exposed to these activists, develops an empathy with the JVP cause, fired by her sense of injustice. Her engagement with these revolutionaries, soon joined by their leaders who were released from prison in late 1977, takes her on a tumultuous spiritual and political roller-coaster where she finds her loyalties leaning more towards party activism than her religious obligations. Finally, she reaches a crisis point and is compelled to make a choice between the two, but she continues to question her own decisions in the context of a rapidly changing political landscape in the 1980s and a resultant dramatic shift in the JVPs outlook and strategy.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":"/jKee9gF4YpQpwiMDmUNjJSWK636.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Sinhalese","iso_639_1":"si","name":"සිංහල"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nun Other Than","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinara Punchihewa","original_name":"Dinara Punchihewa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9ilbyx5C0rB3UPjR0LKciIkgjXp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Young Chitra Bopage","credit_id":"6700945be84eeb35a0f83575","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017661,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Udan Fernando","original_name":"Udan Fernando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670094d66fc74e5756f82b4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3020122,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Athula Sulthanagoda","original_name":"Athula Sulthanagoda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67009595925fdf925b7ceb89","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1887584,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rohana Weerasinghe","original_name":"Rohana Weerasinghe","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/gK7PrFx7m11CuClGVVYiSMadoAB.jpg","credit_id":"670095bb925fdf925b7ceb94","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jKee9gF4YpQpwiMDmUNjJSWK636.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
