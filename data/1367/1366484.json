Since exploding onto the scene these east coast reprobates have given rock music the kick it was so badly in need of. Not only have they won the hearts and minds of the music press and alternative crowd, they have also crossed over into the mainstream without sacrificing any of their credibility.  The Strokes 'New York Stories' now tells the complete story behind the band's success for the first time. Using interviews with their closest colleagues and footage throughout their career, this is a great addition to every fan's collection.","popularity":0.056,"poster_path":"/b38ho8xKEuUOIowpT0xBITCfQ29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Focal Point Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strokes: New York Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sian Jones","original_name":"Sian Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6700c110e480149146854c67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chrissie Miller","original_name":"Chrissie Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6700c11be480149146854c73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Raphael","original_name":"Gordon Raphael","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6700c12867c6fb09fff82ed0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4893960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Lewin","original_name":"Charlotte Lewin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700c0fb6fc74e5756f8330f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b38ho8xKEuUOIowpT0xBITCfQ29.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
