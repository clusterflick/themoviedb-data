In the 1950's they immigrated to Israel, where no one paid attention to their music. They forbade their family members to become musicians, lest they experience the same pain. Despite this, Daud's grandson, Dudu Tassa is a leading performer in today's Israeli rock scene. Releasing an album which features the original music of the Al-Kuwaitis in modern style, Dudu attempts to bridge time, space and culture, healing the family's pain.","popularity":0.0731,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iraq n' Roll","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592106,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dudu Tassa","original_name":"Dudu Tassa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6700b02f925fdf925b7cf031","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4333957,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yair Dalal","original_name":"Yair Dalal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6700b03d925fdf925b7cf039","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Schlomo Al-Kuwaiti","original_name":"Schlomo Al-Kuwaiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6700b05b7830c1301e7ce8b3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833996,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gili Gaon","original_name":"Gili Gaon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700af54e480149146854943","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833996,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gili Gaon","original_name":"Gili Gaon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700af60e48014914685494a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981692,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dudu Ytzhaki","original_name":"Dudu Ytzhaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700af95b146282f7b853e9d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gil Basarab","original_name":"Gil Basarab","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700afb2925fdf925b7cf006","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4981694,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danny Haimovich","original_name":"Danny Haimovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700afc1925fdf925b7cf012","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Avitzur","original_name":"Daniel Avitzur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700afd6e84eeb35a0f839bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833996,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gili Gaon","original_name":"Gili Gaon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6700afe67830c1301e7ce876","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
