As Khmer Rouge soldiers marched into the capital city of Phnom Penh, the unsuspecting people of Cambodia had little idea they would be forced into a living nightmare that would last nearly four years. Rain Falls From Earth is a story of courage, a story of survival and a story of eventual triumph over the Communist regime that was responsible for the deaths of over two million people. The voices of many Cambodians are heard as they convey their thoughts, ideas and emotions - the very things they were forced to abandon in the \"killing fields\" of Cambodia. Their stories are an eyewitness account to genocide.","popularity":0.5692,"poster_path":"/k8fmhzkofNo6p2JNDjJdaFx3Eu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghost-2-Eleven Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":376,"logo_path":"/4TYjUVu74lX3r4ht1ppZxEpj1a4.png","name":"Industry Entertainment Partners","origin_country":"US"},{"id":81299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hanuman Films","origin_country":""},{"id":221278,"logo_path":"/1Zatv9r6NRPOgFH1tQJc65xMmOb.png","name":"SAG-AFTRA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Rain Falls from Earth: Surviving Cambodia's Darkest Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Waterston","original_name":"Sam Waterston","popularity":0.8911,"profile_path":"/fKmtS6OdDWPiAdxZflbJGz1eWml.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"66ff8f14b146282f7b850503","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thida Buth","original_name":"Thida Buth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f22e84eeb35a0f802f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Im Chaem","original_name":"Im Chaem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f28b146282f7b85051d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monirith Chhea","original_name":"Monirith Chhea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f341592ef1ba98509ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vollevann Kaylor","original_name":"Vollevann Kaylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f43e84eeb35a0f80310","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandy Kelley","original_name":"Sandy Kelley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f4ce84eeb35a0f8031b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":129912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vann Nath","original_name":"Vann Nath","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f587830c1301e7cac30","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Savann Kunneke","original_name":"Savann Kunneke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66ff8f5ec9a10d46ea7cbf14","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McClure","original_name":"Steve McClure","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff8f7cf878adfed08514b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve McClure","original_name":"Steve McClure","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff8f846fc74e5756f7f76e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4979974,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Piorkowski","original_name":"Chris Piorkowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ff8f961592ef1ba9850a0a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0875612","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rqSSs5RWGa5ZDHNBLZ0ncYf1pcq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k8fmhzkofNo6p2JNDjJdaFx3Eu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2960,"name":"cambodia"},{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":10349,"name":"survival"},{"id":193730,"name":"khmer rouge"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
