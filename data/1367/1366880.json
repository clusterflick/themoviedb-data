However, things don't go as planned. Not only does she fail to find a husband, but she also becomes the laughingstock of Gao Village.  Her father, Mr. Gao, devises a plan and stages a scenario where a mountain bandit kidnaps her. However, on the way, things go awry, and they encounter Zhu Ganglie (also known as Pigsy). By mistake, Zhu Ganglie ends up sending Gao Cuilan back to her family, leading to a series of love-hate entanglements between the two. Eventually, the monk Tang Sanzang and his companions arrive at Gao Village and \"subdue\" Zhu Ganglie, who then becomes a disciple and joins them on their journey to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures from the West.","popularity":0.0853,"poster_path":"/m14wiXjKRI5OOBSufV8Q6devx6L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marshal Tian Peng Returns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2534279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tan Xin Zer","original_name":"Tan Xin Zer","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/7YnVBOGLouo0u0R6VhjLVy7RdL3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Zhu Gang Lie","credit_id":"6701e8cff3495d72c4f79982","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2698098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huang Youtian","original_name":"Huang Yutian","popularity":0.2658,"profile_path":"/bWNWqSlhh5IypgTwPcC8EaJhYLX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tang Seng","credit_id":"6701e8db1592ef1ba98570bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3091160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pari","original_name":"阿依帕丽·乌古力","popularity":0.2354,"profile_path":"/qWXFumexKSOFtenwS0sZE1rWQWi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Gao Cui Lan","credit_id":"6701e8eb67c6fb09fff86096","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3873511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Luoqian","original_name":"Yang Luo Qian","popularity":0.1736,"profile_path":"/i0tI62jHxtjCGKj9u4viaOl2RfI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Xiao Yu","credit_id":"6701e8fce480149146857d13","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m14wiXjKRI5OOBSufV8Q6devx6L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
