No one knows why the community is no longer growing millet. No one has explored the importance of millet to the lives of ancestors in the past. It gradually disappeared in everyoneâ€™s memory... After half a century, the elders in Sqoyaw decide to sow the millet seeds once again and pass on millet knowledge to the next generation of Atayal descendants.  Will they succeed in adhering to the ancestors' hard work and  continue their relationships with the land?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vjXBPVOIZCk7y0LHp2vV2DsWIIS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hingkangi Ghap na Trakis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sayun Simung","original_name":"Sayun Simung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3123957739410036e75a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737463,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Faliyos Afiyaw","original_name":"Faliyos Afiyaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3123fcf1b5710033efbb80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737461,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karo Sifu","original_name":"Karo Sifu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3123e37739410035eb37cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vjXBPVOIZCk7y0LHp2vV2DsWIIS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Chinese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Mandarin\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"zh\", \"native_name\"=>\"Chinese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
