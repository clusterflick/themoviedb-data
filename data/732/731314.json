In Kiss of Fire , Child reworks images from her squisy TV soap Swamp (1991), to punctuate romantic cliche.” Selected for New York Film Festival Video Visions (1993) Short songs chart erotic tales in an urban topology. Includes FISHTANK, SHIVER, KISS OF FIRE, 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE, and FAINT CLUE. The myths of popular culture—romance and TV soaps— provide the motifs for the work which restructures memory-image-fragment to foreground the body against a mechanized landscape. In the shape of small stories, 8 Million rewrites women's drama.. And on occasion to be the basis of the score: image as conductor, the music performed to the video.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/tIbuzUuFZ8lf17V7aXX0bwxR0ZF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8 Million","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abigail Child","original_name":"Abigail Child","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2f835ef1b5710033e89b4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1119080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ikue Mori","original_name":"Ikue Mori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/moxh9jHGzrIHPygJKd4VbQxktNk.jpg","credit_id":"5f2f83b6417aaf0035f90308","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2148,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tIbuzUuFZ8lf17V7aXX0bwxR0ZF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1432}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1992-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
