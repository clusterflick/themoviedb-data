The black rock of the earth stands in sharp contrast to the billowing vapor that hovers and drifts above the surface. A narrator describes how the island’s first inhabitants sought to explain the violent eruption by attributing the devastation to the wrath of angry gods. With breathtaking black-and-white cinematography, this poetic exploration considers the human relationship to this volatile land, where residents live alongside the looming threat of eruption with reverence, fear, and awe. A collection of scenes where dark and light miraculously coexist illuminates both the physical and spiritual landscapes of this extraordinary place, where life endures the perils of the natural world.","popularity":0.1234,"poster_path":"/5CgXiODe7CvXrrAoILXTK6FfNkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138351,"logo_path":"/8ii7wKDg3Ge3T3XohGWYxCYd3cY.png","name":"A Vol
