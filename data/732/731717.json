Five contemporary young adults run away from a party with no boundaries after the arrival of the police. They run through the woods until they find refuge in a strange house that seems to belong to the sexual revolution of the ’70s. Erotic objects and portraits, a mysterious diary and a long-forgotten family secret are just the beginning of a journey of self-discovery.","popularity":0.2129,"poster_path":"/fSGXGrbpej6AdHtgtLFvmjGZ88n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edoné
