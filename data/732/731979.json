The images of contaminated ruins transform in the fire, light and shadow; the destruction of the industrial space consistently reveals how Cold War energy structures impact recent geopolitical processes and leave planetary threats over long periods of time. The project takes a geological approach – it reads things that compose this flat landscape as a stack of stratigraphic layers. The man­made space is understood as a sedimentary process and the infrastructures, as well as the mineral resources, are assessed as the key parameters defining a development of the project.","popularity":0.0997,"poster_path":"/cc6OjKPHVsA5s03t8zs4BNIBQSU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66008,"logo_path":"/k0SjcmMcK3yxTRJj7GuMhiKCn8v.png","name":"Just A Moment","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Energy Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2133827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","original_name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/nYulQSMUXlEJkRU67S977xneN74.jpg","credit_id":"5f327c6c1967570038b123b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739338,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonas Žukauskas","original_name":"Jonas Žukauskas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3369da29c62600355c5744","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598474,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eitvydas Doškus","original_name":"Eitvydas Doškus","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/a42t2FW11Y4tRGnSr6jGDeS1Zuf.jpg","credit_id":"5f336a148a88b200369e2efe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arturas Bumšteinas","original_name":"Arturas Bumšteinas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f336b040582240036ab2707","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2040873,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sigitas Motoras","original_name":"Sigitas Motoras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f336b50eb64f100360e1d42","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julius Grigelionis","original_name":"Julius Grigelionis","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f336b5f8a88b200349e6aa0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jokūbas Čižikas","original_name":"Jokūbas Čižikas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f336c16e194b00034c52999","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jurgis Matulevičius","original_name":"Jurgis Matulevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/w8Uks0BJ8u5C4SG1Vv3OzP0k6R6.jpg","credit_id":"5f336b338a88b200359f7e7c","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1525201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dagnė Vildžiūnaitė","original_name":"Dagnė Vildžiūnaitė","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/i8PHTsbjpuBMcOQSOkp3ynQxS7f.jpg","credit_id":"5f336be529c62600365d6ae1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2133827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","original_name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/nYulQSMUXlEJkRU67S977xneN74.jpg","credit_id":"5f3369ade194b00036c54da8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2430286,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominykas Kilčiauskas","original_name":"Dominykas Kilčiauskas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f336a34a3e4ba0031cd0868","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598503,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Justinas Vencius","original_name":"Justinas Vencius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f336ad4e194b00033c56a18","department":"Production","job":"Post Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cc6OjKPHVsA5s03t8zs4BNIBQSU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
