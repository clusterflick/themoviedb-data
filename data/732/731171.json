Sid was an obsessive Boston Terrier whose idea of bliss was to be swung around on a rubber pork chop. I was happy to accommodate him. Sid was shot with a 16mm Beaulieu camera which can be seen in shadow at one point in the film. Sid can also be heard barking mixed into Shay’s music. - Jeff Scher","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/bQE8a2q6k7haannoCtqLyEocPTu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shay Lynch","original_name":"Shay Lynch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6229ed0c109cd0004592fc89","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Scher","original_name":"Jeff Scher","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/3oBYq3uCMlx9PQ9vFJrwmGaYhCl.jpg","credit_id":"5f2eeb3e9a358d00378f28f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11928424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQE8a2q6k7haannoCtqLyEocPTu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
