Grabbing material off someone else’s work was considered fair game and part of the fun, and contributed a kinetic dynamic to the ongoing display. Now the place is a park, and the sculptures are gone, but you can see what it used to be like in this neat and funny documentary by Ric Reynolds, augmented by Erich Seibert’s wonderful musique-concrète/time-lapse sequences. The flashback circus sequence includes Scott Beach and Bill Irwin. Sculptors interviewed include Walt Zucker, Tony Puccio, Robert Sommer, Ron & Mary Bradden, and Bob Kaminsky.","popularity":0.5609,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mudflat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Beach","original_name":"Scott Beach","popularity":0.2506,"profile_path":"/5Y3SbZeqOcw2w5KUUwnUjGoir6b.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2f60b49a358d00388f9c99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Irwin","original_name":"Bill Irwin","popularity":0.5268,"profile_path":"/bAV5qsljgiHQkn3QluB5clVYC13.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f2f60cb3c3ab00037472dac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walt Zucker","original_name":"Walt Zucker","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f2f60e0f1b5710036e7d99c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Puccio","original_name":"Tony Puccio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f2f60ff3c3ab0003546dad1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Sommer","original_name":"Robert Sommer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f2f611a559d22003772e113","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Bradden","original_name":"Ron Bradden","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f2f613a559d22003571fd4a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Bradden","original_name":"Mary Bradden","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f2f614c3c3ab0003546dde3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Kaminsky","original_name":"Bob Kaminsky","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f2f61fb3c3ab00034480538","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard A.
