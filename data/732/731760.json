They have been brutally stricken by misfortune. It is not their shared past that brought them together, but it is “Hope” that keeps them alive, encouraging them to move on. “Hope” presents the different but powerful stories of Ferdonije, Auntie, Makfirete and Valentina. Although life can sometimes be very difficult, one must always try to find something to hold onto. Without hope, these four characters’ lives would have ended a long time ago. “Hope” has a power that even magic does not.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4693935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdonije Qerkezi","original_name":"Ferdonije Qerkezi","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"679fc98980082986c8cb7d25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5220639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hajrie Gashi","original_name":"Hajrie Gashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"679fca0950f5d47625262378","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vjosa Abazi","original_name":"Vjosa Abazi","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3192b2fcadb40035e58b1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HOPE – Official Documentary Film Trailer","key":"3NiqWTRb6ls","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-28T10:00:01.000Z","id":"679fc9e1776edf4be3953d66"}]}}}
