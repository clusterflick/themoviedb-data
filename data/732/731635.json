There they learn to take photographs, and at the same time, present their ‘life maps’ to each other; large charts full of family photos, scrawled poetry and quotations, the names of emotions and crisscrossing green, red and black marker lines, detailing all the ups and downs, forwards and reverses of their lives. With grief, humour, defiance, the women are able to unearth memories and tell stories, which have remained buried for 30 years in the course of just trying to survive devastating years of war, dictatorship and sanctions. In the end, they have woven together the threads of their individual lives into a collective fabric. And because this is a creative project, the experience is transformative; the act of remembering and listening is dynamic and productive.","popularity":0.0947,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our feelings took the pictures:  Open Shutters Iraq","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2737394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maysoon Pachachi","original_name":"Maysoon Pachachi","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f31052e8ed03f0036f00da0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2870956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
