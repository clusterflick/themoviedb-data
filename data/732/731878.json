Branch demonstrates the most successful stand-up escapes used by the OSU wrestling team, beginning with the stand-up technique to counter the most common offenses from the top position (spiral rides, under-hooks, 2-on-1 control, and ankle control). Branch then demonstrates several rolls to escape or get a reversal. Also included is instruction on methods for getting out of the flat position as well as several methods for fighting a top man with one or both legs in. This tape is great for converting defense into offense!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8xoUcp6e45qfuEYd1MSNfxfR79J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bottom Position Stand-Ups and Roll-Outs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xoUcp6e45qfuEYd1MSNfxfR79J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
