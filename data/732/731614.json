Look no further! Oklahoma State Head Coach John Smith has compiled a wrestling DVD filled with set-ups and tie-ups that will make you a more effective wrestler on your feet. Coach Smith has divided the tape into three areas: Elbow control, Inside control and reset positions. Each section covers more than five set-ups. Elbow control techniques covered include passing elbow, elbow hyperextension, over the top and steering wheel. Inside control techniques covered include pull/pass, inside post and wrist control. The reset position shown allows a wrestler to reverse the control with an underhook or 2-on-1. This is an excellent instructional wrestling DVD that will help set up the move and help stop the opponent's penetration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wNZejCITnxjwjg3MeOsDCL4ruVu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Smith's Set-Ups & Tie-Ups: Being Effective from Your Feet","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1356,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNZejCITnxjwjg3MeOsDCL4ruVu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
