Along the way, it performs a detournement and unconcealment of World War 2 newsreels and the vulgar iconography propagated by colonial propaganda. It features the conversation of an American documentarist-narrator and an Igorot with a mysterious identity whose voices fuse as one.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9tNnZkJgyS88Fc1vSdFjoAWmfUB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man in a Barrel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3654221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noli Agbayani Manaig","original_name":"Noli Agbayani Manaig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e75072d388ae007d28f546","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tNnZkJgyS88Fc1vSdFjoAWmfUB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
