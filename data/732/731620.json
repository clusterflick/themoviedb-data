The technique for the stand-up has to be good or you won't be able to get away from a good rider. John Smith begins with his philosophy on the move and some key points on finding a base position that is comfortable for you. From there Coach Smith demonstrates the inside leg stand-up - from the base position to getting away once you reach your feet. He goes step-by-step through the move, highlighting the key points as he goes along. From there he shows how to successfully hit the stand-up versus three common breakdowns - the chop, ankle pick and spiral ride. He also includes a stand-up variation for heavyweight wrestlers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/m0rfMObaL5hom81jWqC9h8DYr9h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stand-Ups: The Art of Coming Off the Mat","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1360,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0rfMObaL5hom81jWqC9h8DYr9h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
