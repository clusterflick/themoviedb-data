In 2019, he reflects on his refusal to appear before the New York State Board of Parole. The words resonate from his cell with images of the Great Migration. The invocation of a life before walls. The images' epistolary narrative takes us from Alabama, his birthplace, to the New York subway where he was arrested and beaten. Before arriving to Haiti's spiritual world, his words pass through cotton fields and factories. We encounter Bobby Seale in prison, a youth who embodies his African heritage during the Vietnam War, while his fathers are murdered in the United States.","popularity":0.1086,"poster_path":"/w3glhPD4Ui4QMwkU6RdsnZ5EWFo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98185,"logo_path":"/gxVbK10TbKaXI66lXqWmpvkIqvW.png","name":"Haute école d'art et de design – Genève (HEAD – Genève)","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The De Facto Martyr Suite","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2738630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Born Hadithi","original_name":"Born Hadithi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5f3289d18ed03f0036f53ff1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2738628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justine de Gasquet","original_name":"Justine de Gasquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kuQUvMxplg5mTWAUQ9BwdDXQj7j.jpg","credit_id":"5f3289061967570038b13885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelange Quay","original_name":"Michelange Quay","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3289761967570039b2f549","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w3glhPD4Ui4QMwkU6RdsnZ5EWFo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - The de facto martyr suite by Justine de Gasquet","key":"437833801","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-13T12:16:47.000Z","id":"5f328a0b663b870035514620"}]}}}
