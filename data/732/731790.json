The piece of memories and nostalgia about ‘Busan Tower’ which is the symbol of my hometown is getting dim while I click the shutter of the camera. The emotion that comes to the climax when I started to take pictures have reached '925' and is close to '0' when I finished shooting the 925th photograph. At that time I experienced that the mass of emotions faded out. Now it remains just 925 pieces of still‐cut which is the trace of memory playback.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/skRy6YrJYhOGp4PqXjgmL6Jsd6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"925 Pieces of Busan Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byun Jae-kyu","original_name":"Byun Jae-kyu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f31bdb18ed03f0034f17077","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/skRy6YrJYhOGp4PqXjgmL6Jsd6I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
