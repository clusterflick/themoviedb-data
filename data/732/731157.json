Itâ€™s one of those big cathartic dreams, a labyrinth of fleeting moments full of metaphor and mischief. I wanted it to feel like a bumpy roller coaster ride in and out of the dark side of the brain where discomforting images are stored away. And, as with all dreams, the meaning and significance are open to interpretation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/4g41Op3ZcfMUSKze6zwKTZBXKmd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garden of Regrets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Scher","original_name":"Jeff Scher","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/3oBYq3uCMlx9PQ9vFJrwmGaYhCl.jpg","credit_id":"5f2ee3653c3ab000364672d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11928366","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4g41Op3ZcfMUSKze6zwKTZBXKmd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
