In the middle of a crowded square a businessman is lying on a bench, seemingly asleep. Someplace else, a teenager is longing for appreciation. A commuter is fighting the ticket machine. The film shows ten tableaux of everyday situations in the city. The people in them are confronted with small or big problems. Each one of them is a Sisyphos, endlessly rolling the little stones of daily life up the mountain.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/oZJUUB5syo48NWMITVgqq5ggENC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dynamic
