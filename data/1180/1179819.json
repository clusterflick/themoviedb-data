Everyone knows she is dead, but no one can find the body. The ex-husband is the murderer, but it can't be proved without the body. The ex-husband becomes more demented as the movie progresses, and is eventually told to leave the house. He returns opening night to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting public, who can't tell what is real from what's not until it's their turn to die. The movie comes to a climax when the truth is revealing as to what really happened to this madman's ex-wife.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdun Manor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Keane","original_name":"Harry Keane","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506dc0945765d013b5f60c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Karpiak","original_name":"Mike Karpiak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506dce4109dec00aeafc307","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763042,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith R.
