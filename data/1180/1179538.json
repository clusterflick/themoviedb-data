Life in Jellybean Square, a housing project in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, was a world away from the things Corey grew up wanting: a fancy car, a big house, a great job and a bright future. With a head full of dreams and empty pockets he turned to selling drugs on the street. Central to the film is the transformative power of a weekend retreat for young Black males, organized by BROS (Brothers Reaching Out Society) together with the film's director, Russell Wyse. At the heart of the film lies Wyse's conviction that despite all the odds against them young Black men can succeed if they have the will, the opportunity, and the support of a community. -NFB","popularity":0.1118,"poster_path":"/yHkLFoPC6WQ6LXYMuELjdyQfzGJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brother 2 Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4275482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Lucas","original_name":"Corey Lucas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6505f73042d8a500e15754e0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685941,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aram Kouyoumdjian","original_name":"Aram Kouyoumdjian","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6505f7a25aadc400ae02017f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"6505f7db45765d00adafd084","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4275478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Wyse","original_name":"Russell Wyse","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6505f74245765d013b5ed101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3895885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Salter","original_name":"Alex Salter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1J7CnBudXrV4XAkvuOPUlyzVNGZ.jpg","credit_id":"6505f7b5373ac2011c3e2c0c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779508,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lawrence Jackman","original_name":"Lawrence Jackman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6505f77c42d8a5011bd6355c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Clarke","original_name":"Annette Clarke","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686d2bb9dfca1f2a61a6ce4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068485,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kent Nason","original_name":"Kent Nason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fujgwp9srNvqZJn0FR9V7hkjrHo.jpg","credit_id":"67981cd59a30a85b272404b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zxrBAI6VUDJ5xRje58FE85kEl73.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yHkLFoPC6WQ6LXYMuELjdyQfzGJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Aired on CBC Newsworld as winner of Reel Diversity Competition","release_date":"2004-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Brother 2 Brother","key":"-wt59sMSEBI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2023-11-21T20:21:10.000Z","id":"655d734d9d893900c6932288"}]}}}
