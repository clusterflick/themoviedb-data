Our assigned theme was \"puppet or clown.\" Mary came up with the concept and banged out a rough script in a couple of hours. It was shot it in a day and a half, thanks to the endurance of our DP, Jack Farrell. We didn't win any big prizes but we had a tremendous amount of fun. (Later, I re-edited the piece, gave it a spit-polish.) Many thanks to the actors, assistants, and all involved who pitched in on very short notice and gave it their all!","popularity":0.0859,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":208818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bay Tree Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Strung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Scott","original_name":"Kathryn Scott","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Babysitter","credit_id":"65068ad6fa27f4012d5a9216","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3553714,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Catlan McClelland","original_name":"Catlan McClelland","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Puppet","credit_id":"65068af1394a8700ff6c1913","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zane Kaufmann","original_name":"Zane Kaufmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Zane","credit_id":"65068b0e109dec010cc1c81a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Ravich","original_name":"Nick Ravich","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"65068b1845765d011d4c2a27","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issac Yelchin","original_name":"Issac Yelchin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Issac","credit_id":"65068b2645765d00adb02c4e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezra Yelchin","original_name":"Ezra Yelchin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ezra","credit_id":"65068b3042d8a500c4fbea2b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1913634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Farrell","original_name":"Jack Farrell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65068a60394a8700e2261112","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Kuryla","original_name":"Mary Kuryla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65068a6d373ac200acd6a49b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889394,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rob Ward","original_name":"Rob Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65068a95fa27f400ae9e6bc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Kondo","original_name":"Brian Kondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65068b42394a8700e22611ca","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347149,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rob Ward","original_name":"Rob Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65068b57109dec010cc1c84a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
