Revisiting her own roots, Mi'kmaq filmmaker and mother Catherine Anne Martin explores how the community is recovering its First Nations values, particularly through the teachings of elders and a collective approach to children-rearing. Mi'kmaq Family is an inspiring resource for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous audiences who are looking for ways to strengthen and explore their own families and traditions.  We hear the Mi'kmaq language spoken and a lullaby is sung by a Mi'kmaq grandmother featured in the film.","popularity":0.287,"poster_path":"/2xj2wM1Lvj7vmsvYkDH4n78Ccqg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mi'kmaq Family (Migmaoei Otjiosog)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2675417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Anne Martin","original_name":"Catherine Anne Martin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/b8QrwSQfdA1cRX9St07nAmiuPbF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"650617cb109dec00aeaf4bad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1643052,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shelagh Mackenzie","original_name":"Shelagh Mackenzie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506180d45765d013b5edeec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693316,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jane Porter","original_name":"Jane Porter","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506189f42d8a5011bd644b5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arthur McKay","original_name":"Arthur McKay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65061874109dec00aeaf4bdb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2675417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Anne Martin","original_name":"Catherine Anne Martin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/b8QrwSQfdA1cRX9St07nAmiuPbF.jpg","credit_id":"650617ea109dec00ca06d23c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marilyn A.
