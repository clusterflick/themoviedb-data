The love and support of his family, church and an inclusive school culture, as well as Samâ€™s courage, have helped him accomplish extraordinary things. The movie epitomizes what occurs when love prevails and courage rules.  Sam's positive outlook amid bullying and his desire to achieve more than was expected of him, make Sam an inspiration for people with disabilities, and, ALL people.  Because of Sam, a new documentary by Tampa native and University of South Florida Alumna Renee Warmack, takes you along an up-close journey with Sam Piazza and his family, from his birth, to winning Homecoming King at Gaither High School, to his rock star status as a team member at PDQ. The movie shows the world that being different can be difficult, but it also depicts how the conflicts and triumphs that occur in the life of a person with disabilities can serve as catalysts for positive change in the lives of those who cross his path.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/npTAffm2QLQ27EnI3nuRpgh9TAU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Because of Sam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renee Warmack","original_name":"Renee Warmack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504a24275110d00c7166539","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10371822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npTAffm2QLQ27EnI3nuRpgh9TAU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
