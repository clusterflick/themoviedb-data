The James Andersen collection documents over 50 years of community life in and around Makkovik, Labrador. The stories that accompany \"Uncle Jim's\" work explain why for over 50 years he has never been without a camera as he documented daily rituals and life. Andersen does not shy away from telling these stories but shares them with conviction and with a voice that honours each event's importance; the church being rebuilt, fish being caught, and stories of sickness and death are each told with the same reverence.","popularity":0.5105,"poster_path":"/3zTmFwBrZeXKL3kBDH7sYfl2ArL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192168,"logo_path":"/79892TUkSsRilVFc8sFgtT9Inix.png","name":"NIFCO","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Andersen: Over 50 Years of Taking Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Andersen","original_name":"James Andersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6506edb0394a8700c5bdc74b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rhonda Buckley","original_name":"Rhonda Buckley","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506edeefa27f400ae9ea566","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3098819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Lewis","original_name":"James Lewis","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506ef3742d8a500c4fc2094","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397803,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Cook","original_name":"Steve Cook","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506efa3109dec00aeafcaf7","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catharine Andersen","original_name":"Catharine Andersen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506eedd3cd12c00ad8b4a7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827616,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lori Clarke","original_name":"Lori Clarke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506ef70373ac200e21af319","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4276554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rhonda Buckley","original_name":"Rhonda Buckley","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506eeb9109dec010cc1fdf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890585,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Hong","original_name":"John Hong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506ef5e42d8a501389a85eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harvey Hyslop","original_name":"Harvey Hyslop","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506ef4845765d013b5f695f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29869113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3zTmFwBrZeXKL3kBDH7sYfl2ArL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eF2xcFoswhotvBpYfEuPCMdrXmo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":5890,"name":"community"},{"id":322390,"name":"local"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
