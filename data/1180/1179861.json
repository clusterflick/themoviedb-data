Until 1979 it was illegal for fishermen to form a union in Nova Scotia. The committed funding from the National Film Board was withdrawn for this film, however the filmmakers continued to edit the film by entering the NFB at night. The CBC refused to broadcast the film, but it was finally released in 1990 and broadcast nationally that year on Vision TV.","popularity":0.1512,"poster_path":"/enauA6Bee6WlQfJiqdUrUjKCcWe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":208839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fish or Cut Bait Collective","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fish or Cut Bait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Burger","original_name":"Tom Burger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506f7ed394a87013915d963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill McKiggan","original_name":"Bill McKiggan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506f7fb109dec012d891b5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4276591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Lapp","original_name":"Chuck Lapp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506f83b42d8a500abb410b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5LV4HT8tAagsn1D2lItLnw5zUbT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/enauA6Bee6WlQfJiqdUrUjKCcWe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":274711,"name":"fishermen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VisionTV","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
