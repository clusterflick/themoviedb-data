This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/tYuMXXTCQabfDCTJCWC1Eee8LdL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"fly","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Hope Woodworth","original_name":"Jessica Hope Woodworth","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/bUcyHERvVa88kFRnKZDTXpQUW87.jpg","credit_id":"650480a781da39010c2d5c55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273541,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tsar B","original_name":"Tsar B","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650480b9c92c5d00febf00d0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tYuMXXTCQabfDCTJCWC1Eee8LdL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Fest Ghent Website","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
