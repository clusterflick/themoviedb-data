This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":"/jk3IEe81X7wAQCDBxXwt32isjGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pleiades (or Going Home)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amalia Bableki","original_name":"Amalia Bableki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6f891f3e6001399ea6b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphne Drakopoulou","original_name":"Daphne Drakopoulou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6f9cf28838029ec5b4ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antigone Grigoropoulou","original_name":"Antigone Grigoropoulou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6fb40cb33516f8834ecd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Korachai","original_name":"Maria Korachai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6fc4358da700e3bdaf01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Mentza","original_name":"Maria Mentza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6fd10cb33516f63ebfbf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrto Rozaki","original_name":"Myrto Rozaki","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6fdef28838029ec5b51a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Fezo","original_name":"Jenny Fezo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"652b6fea1511aa00ad350578","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Lentzou","original_name":"Ζακλίν Λέντζου","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/nYBlhmiCKtSFCHLtRrMbb7Ol1TQ.jpg","credit_id":"65047983ffc9de0ee20afa89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":278,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustavo Santaolalla","original_name":"Gustavo Santaolalla","popularity":0.2864,"profile_path":"/choWlKxCcMeZj5iuEcxEp2vWMCW.jpg","credit_id":"6504797363aad2011b234e12","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Lentzou","original_name":"Ζακλίν Λέντζου","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/nYBlhmiCKtSFCHLtRrMbb7Ol1TQ.jpg","credit_id":"65049ee259e8a9013b3c3f66","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364006,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stelios Cotionis","original_name":"Στέλιος Κοτιώνης","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65049ef981da39014fdb5b94","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429108,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Konstantinos Koukoulios","original_name":"Κωνσταντίνος Κουκούλιος","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65049f23798e06010c754606","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antigoni Rota","original_name":"Antigoni Rota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65049f0ac92c5d013806ab10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521916,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marios Kleftakis","original_name":"Marios Kleftakis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652b700c1f3e6000ac4e7706","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jk3IEe81X7wAQCDBxXwt32isjGy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
