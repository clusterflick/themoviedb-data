This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":"/swMDDw1mvinQ4XQc1qrcGzbTTgx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stijn Coninx","original_name":"Stijn Coninx","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/rw9sdCRhj0tnjtzLA07WfXONpZK.jpg","credit_id":"65046de3ffc9de0ee20af550","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anne Dudley","original_name":"Anne Dudley","popularity":0.1734,"profile_path":"/2uOcB8lvx3pxfjACFoOXLSGjK1y.jpg","credit_id":"65046dfcd7dcd2011c626234","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swMDDw1mvinQ4XQc1qrcGzbTTgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Fest Ghent Website","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
