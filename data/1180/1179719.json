Lucheni claims that he did no more than what Elisabeth herself wanted, since all her life Elisabeth has been in love with Death himself – and vice versa. As his witnesses, Lucheni brings back the dead aristocracy of the bygone era and takes us to the past, where he serves as a sarcastic narrator of the events that lead to the transformation of the sweet and innocent Sisi to the revered and infamous Elisabeth, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, and her decline through later years until her assassination.","popularity":0.1724,"poster_path":"/fEO9nbFLZiTjWdmjh3Um8AybtBT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Elisabeth","title":"Elisabeth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Elisabeth das Musical","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pia Douwes","original_name":"Pia Douwes","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/9rm1kKIN2UiyZuHSrtB8rLfBGLs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elisabeth (Sisi)","credit_id":"6506ab50373ac2011c3ea7fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Kröger","original_name":"Uwe Kröger","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/5nmgGrWKDg4GflUVSSNKDCqjzTf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Der Tod","credit_id":"6506ab6342d8a500fe3afb0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Freeman","original_name":"Ethan Freeman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/whIwL581DS0J99pUeD1Z1WhGQhl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luigi Lucheni","credit_id":"6506abb7109dec012d88f41f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Gernot","original_name":"Viktor Gernot","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/aMqsKJiLwf30fWkyGNKqplKaiOS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kaiser Franz Joseph I.","credit_id":"6506abeffa27f400ae9e82b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Else Ludwig","original_name":"Else Ludwig","popularity":0.1977,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Erzhherzogin Sophie","credit_id":"6506ac24373ac20139feeef8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Bieber","original_name":"Andreas Bieber","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kronprinz Rudolf","credit_id":"6506ac3e373ac200e21ad14d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122749,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Kunze","original_name":"Michael Kunze","popularity":0.1245,"profile_path":"/11tyF03oUMme3K3t9wL034l0laV.jpg","credit_id":"653d4e65bc2cb300c97e61ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvester Levay","original_name":"Sylvester Levay","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d4e15c8a5ac0100f9fec6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122749,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Kunze","original_name":"Michael Kunze","popularity":0.1245,"profile_path":"/11tyF03oUMme3K3t9wL034l0laV.jpg","credit_id":"653d4e49c8a5ac013a86d47e","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kupfer","original_name":"Harry Kupfer","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d4e98cc968300ade6b913","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":2158,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8sp7aKXVysk8kTQszcL4MmTxmDi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fEO9nbFLZiTjWdmjh3Um8AybtBT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1992-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
