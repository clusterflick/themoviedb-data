It is promoted and organised by national radio station triple j. In previous years, the host town was selected in the form of a competition where residents of the town must gain approval from local government and a venue. For the 2009 event, triple j itself simply decided to host the event in Sale. The station arranges the artists to perform â€“ usually four high-profile Australian bands of a variety of genres.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rD9rOqN9XXUxnNkGL6NNNeU7C57.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triple J's One Night Stand Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rD9rOqN9XXUxnNkGL6NNNeU7C57.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
