Brideswell, in reality, a fictional author, and performed by the equally fictional Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society, it’s a 1920s murder mystery comedy that opens with the slaying of Charles Haversham on the night of his engagement to Florence Colleymoore. The CPDS are gamely attempting to do it justice, but suffice to say they put the amateur in ‘amateur theatre company’, and the result is slapstick and farce.","popularity":0.234,"poster_path":"/5TinhRCcJOa66l3iVgwxUDZwAKu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Play That Goes Wrong","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Murder Before Christmas","type":"Original Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Shields","original_name":"Henry Shields","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/agcRECHRAtpfwEE1E0GRr5LYnJd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"660c61a8c8a5ac017c79e027","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Lewis","original_name":"Henry Lewis","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/czCzJM6jmhYK6AMx9hNd8gsNSOn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"660c61be9c97bd0163a410a4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Sayer","original_name":"Jonathan Sayer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/qZL8PP6k2F8Ux4S3yuMjn8asv1g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dennis","credit_id":"660c61c933a376017d811513","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Russell","original_name":"Charlie Russell","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/rP75LSnb5tYxMxzjr6XzFhhFW8U.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"660c61d50b5fd6017c382c6f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1730636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Zamit","original_name":"Nancy Zamit","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":"/tCKjUO2AHjnz5i66M6B2WkWo2n.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Annie","credit_id":"660c61f50b5fd6017c382c95","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Hearn","original_name":"Dave Hearn","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":"/m2OXyhDIUUXf49N1A8I7pv2jnp1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Max","credit_id":"660c621715dea0017c350b46","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Sayer","original_name":"Jonathan Sayer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/qZL8PP6k2F8Ux4S3yuMjn8asv1g.jpg","credit_id":"665f3d47a835a3a17a51713c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Lewis","original_name":"Henry Lewis","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/czCzJM6jmhYK6AMx9hNd8gsNSOn.jpg","credit_id":"665f3d36a8616b91eaccc1bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Shields","original_name":"Henry Shields","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/agcRECHRAtpfwEE1E0GRr5LYnJd.jpg","credit_id":"665f3d56dd2bb92fda517e44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n6W7lABm62MQgNdSAvdblzwEy27.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w3skJgEa70VrknOBoBx1JEjr7u3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2UVp11amM8VKP8Yx03sJN0lDSVm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8qs6S6X6y4cDIVerB4PwysKwAoi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wnsTOz4O13LdnmwTiH23rtiTVXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hc486HTLNFBNxWx2eBD2jV4raon.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5w1dSx3fgqfbnogkff2OqKF8QMS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5TinhRCcJOa66l3iVgwxUDZwAKu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":330812,"name":"goes wrong"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Mischief Theatre premiere 'The Play That Goes Wrong' at the Old Red Lion Theatre","release_date":"2012-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
