From the birth of the blockbuster era in the 1970s, through the emergence of visual effects in the 1990s, and even today, in a cinematic world dominated by superheroes and streaming services, Spielberg has left fingerprints across film history. With so many citing his movies as influences, whether they're in the audience, or pursuing their own journey into film, his impact on cinema is unmatched. The influence of Spielberg stems from his ability to span genres and generations, from E.T. to Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan to Ready Player One, telling the stories of ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances. But his own journey from growing up in post-war America to changing cinema forever might just be his most extraordinary tale.\"","popularity":0.6776,"poster_path":"/asPfFEJwdhP40T41yE4RVVdIwOs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moviemakers: Spielberg","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Spielberg","original_name":"Steven Spielberg","popularity":2.959,"profile_path":"/tZxcg19YQ3e8fJ0pOs7hjlnmmr6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6506f58c3cd12c014ebf58c2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Dubreuil","original_name":"Louis Dubreuil","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506f5773cd12c014ebf58b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Dubreuil","original_name":"Louis Dubreuil","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506f57e373ac200e21af515","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27721895","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/asPfFEJwdhP40T41yE4RVVdIwOs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
