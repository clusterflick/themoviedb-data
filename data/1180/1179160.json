Here, we learn that Piña is a digital vessel who lives in the distant future and uploads, stores and shares the familial knowledge, dreams and desires transmitted to them from the past. Messengers from various realms and places around the world use digitally altered pineapple fabric to upload their data for the deity, who lives to receive, care for and disseminate the information for its continued preservation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wQOHiG4PkVsFLVy92cWj2JwZJF9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Nakikita mo ba ako?” (Do you see me?)","title":"Piña, Why is the Sky Blue?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Comilang","original_name":"Stephanie Comilang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504ca8d109dec00eb153e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4274085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Speiser","original_name":"Simon Speiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504caa342d8a5011bd5760d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ibafjD9Glja9v5pbRr2SY4JZEca.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQOHiG4PkVsFLVy92cWj2JwZJF9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
