A hurricane of bizarre characters are on-board the Stanton Bullet, as it winds through time and space heading for Sunny-Ville, a hot vacation spot. The menagerie of misfits brilliantly brought to life range from middle-aged housewives to an unidentified \"small thing\". All is thrown into chaos when a set of dashing (albeit girlish) twin brothers, decide to rob the train, claiming to be the fiercest bandits in the land. By some bizarre twist of fate they are soon joined by a maniacal killer who gets down to steadily reducing the numbers of the passengers and crew. A handsome mystery boy, believing he's invincible, tries to save the day.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/9F30QqLqCkZtDqh7vQQUIuF4Pyf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pajama Men: Last Stand to Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2063007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9F30QqLqCkZtDqh7vQQUIuF4Pyf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
