Forced to seek council from an unorthodox therapist (Eugenie Bondurant, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It), Sanders must attempt to resolve his inner turmoil through experimental hypnosis that sends him back in time to face his past.  Written and directed by Florida-based filmmaker Andrew Kiaroscuro, whose own father Benjamin passed from suicide when Andrew was 19 years old, 115 Grains is a personal and provocative exploration of the morality of being a police officer — an examination of not just what it means to the individual who puts on the badge, but to the community of people they serve.","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":"/7Cu5opn2NmILo3G4AryRzgB8inC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"115 Grains","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3226998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kiaroscuro","original_name":"Andrew Kiaroscuro","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6504a712c92c5d011bfd919d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Cu5opn2NmILo3G4AryRzgB8inC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"First-Look Screening","release_date":"2022-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
