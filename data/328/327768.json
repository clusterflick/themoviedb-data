Good Bye My Secret Friend) tells the heartfelt story of a young boy named Toshio and his imaginary friend Ike-chan. Toshio's floating blob of a friend has two big eyes and a mouth, and changes colors and sizes depending on the mood. When Toshio is sad, she turns small. When Toshio makes friend with a girl, she turns bright red from anger. Ike-chan stays by Toshio's side as he grows older, but the day he finds his first love, Ike-chan disappears from his life. Child actor Fukasawa Arashi (Helen the Baby Fox) takes the leading role in this affecting fable about childhood, friendship, and growing up from director Ohoka Toshihiko. Popular actress Aoi Yu voices Ike-chan.","popularity":1.0223,"poster_path":"/jMXIinL7gvbmW8WPAO6f4rJHaCZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2073,"logo_path":"/tWxRSaKmRJNTcmtlXsmn5R4KOSU.png","name":"KADOKAWA","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Bye, My Secret Friend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Ike-chan to boku","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"小池与我","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu Aoi","original_name":"蒼井優","popularity":4.4993,"profile_path":"/tgozZzaAFnOr7YQ8Y9Yk9p2e2JC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"607da1027776f000298bf663","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arashi Fukasawa","original_name":"深澤嵐","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/9MzQpDoO6dOF7t0p07ljlHuD9sG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yoshio (Boku)","credit_id":"54f16a88c3a3683248001197","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rie Tomosaka","original_name":"ともさかりえ","popularity":0.7455,"profile_path":"/fTGR8yLazWyLDASMNgEjhJ6tUhW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mitsuko","credit_id":"54f16aa49251416b2f000f8c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masato Hagiwara","original_name":"萩原聖人","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/iS8eHxcb6R2eL84XcBGJagQCNRj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Shigeyuki","credit_id":"54f16ad5c3a36832480011a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuyuki Moto","original_name":"モト冬樹","popularity":0.186,"profile_path":"/bccDTS0DXU3o5sQ5TeCIMxCvrZz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kiyojii","credit_id":"54f16b1b9251416b38000ed7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misako Renbutsu","original_name":"蓮佛美沙子","popularity":0.8497,"profile_path":"/gi3eKsmjPbfpSr2k5ukH1sLJGKp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Misako / Misae","credit_id":"54f16b4e9251416b35000e43","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tokio Emoto","original_name":"柄本時生","popularity":0.6535,"profile_path":"/3rJvkwGgA4IQWh5kxKEWjungq8m.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tetsu","credit_id":"54f16b809251416b38000ee2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toshihiko Ooka","original_name":"Toshihiko Ooka","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f16a219251416b3b000e5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toshihiko Ooka","original_name":"Toshihiko Ooka","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f16a399251416b2c000f12","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1427236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o3eEj5sCEyopypO4HzewleU6HgS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/jMXIinL7gvbmW8WPAO6f4rJHaCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1994,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/19pMtjW2mcVokw6nVxtSYV1vle0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1329}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ike-chan to boku - Trailer","key":"kI48LUZ1D50","published_at":"2013-08-21T20:14:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58caa698c3a368419300d282"}]}}}
