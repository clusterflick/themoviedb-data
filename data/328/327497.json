The teenager has an African-American friend, J.B., whom he wants to hang out with, but his father doesn’t want him leaving the house to meet up with J.B.—and especially not at night. “I want to keep you from bad situations,” the father explains to his son—an eerie foretelling, but more important, indicative of the violence that this white man associates with all black boys, even J.B., a black boy he knows personally and considers to be “a good kid.”","popularity":1.1721,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53155,"logo_path":"/eQFk6bF8ZclIEhlmTomFsIWKdjH.png","name":"Tiny Giant
