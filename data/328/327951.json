Adventures of a band of youngsters, living in a stripped district of Ouagadougou, who seek hopes. The easy way and ingeniousness compensate for the money which often is lacking. Sadness is banished of a resolutely optimistic way of life. Plunders and odd jobs constitute the daily newspaper of this struggle for life. The ones will succeed modestly, the others will fail more or less but a great solidarity of group remains.","popularity":0.1473,"poster_path":"/yd7xoEPazoiRk3OwhsejqdHsCGl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sahélis
