When a member of one of the communities, Nathu (Kishore Kadam) decides to protest against a decision he feels is unjust, he angers the local land owner, who decides to impose economic sanctions on the community in an effort to starve them out of the village. When Nathu's house is burned down in mysterious circumstances, Nathu seeks the comfort of a temple, and prays for a solution. Instead he finds himself abused and beaten by the land owner for breaking a rule that bans members of Nathu's community from entering the temple. It later emerges that the situation in the area is being used as a plot for a film made in Bombay, however characters featured in the film are misrepresented, which leads to tension on the set and eventually violence spills.","popularity":0.4877,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1999-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajit Kapoor","original_name":"Rajit Kapoor","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/mATIzHiXTeW6xB8IoJVLTD5NDMn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"592f2727c3a36852f0002303","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajeshwari Sachdev","original_name":"Rajeshwari Sachdev","popularity":0.4347,"profile_path":"/ejOF39MgrZdzzEDhHR9dU5YjoS7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57210059c3a3681181000869","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Divya Dutta","original_name":"Divya Dutta","popularity":0.473,"profile_path":"/mr8GYp92eizLVXBQxQndkxKuJH1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f94ff54a12856003fbf54d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":230632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seema Biswas","original_name":"Seema Biswas","popularity":0.2664,"profile_path":"/nRd9anbVgvsRrWbH3G09nWTThHp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f94ff5f99d5c30032d1a2b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kishore Kadam","original_name":"Kishore Kadam","popularity":0.4828,"profile_path":"/r8r20HPAjcwErxEmxmhxXe7Byi4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5721006c925141422e000774","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shyam Benegal","original_name":"Shyam Benegal","popularity":0.52,"profile_path":"/vuHJntA9MawzIfYvwsFDI2OC3QZ.jpg","credit_id":"57210036c3a368118e000790","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259547","wikidata_id":"Q7408772","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
