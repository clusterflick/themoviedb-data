When Rebekah's marriage falls apart in real time, we realize her dream is not a whim. It is a burning passion for music that comes with its share of real world sacrifices. Thanks to the support from her newfound rock n roll legend friends such as Steven Adler (Guns n Roses) and Rikki Rocket (Poison), Starr re-commits to her mission and accomplishes what she set out to do. Her contagious optimism acts as the film's through line, hoping to inspire anyone feeling trapped by their circumstances.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/o5eoK5Wa17pqXlDQXMwjZn0GR2I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Way","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vinny Sisson","original_name":"Vinny Sisson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f0c3f592514179680088d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Mollee","original_name":"Dominique Mollee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f0c3e1925141796e00871d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2266789","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5eoK5Wa17pqXlDQXMwjZn0GR2I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":754},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kcTDcaCDkVpwBtbSshDUg6C9enA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
