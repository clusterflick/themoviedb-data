In particular he is to look into the conduct and behavior of Jón Prímus, the old pastor at Snæfell. Fantastic rumors are rife: amongst other things it is said that a corpse is lodged in the glacier! Armed with his tape recorder and notebook, Umbi embarks upon his mission. He tries to question the weird locals, a weird lot, but gets evasive answers. Slowly he is dragged into a quagmire of strange happenings and his efforts to understand only make him confused. If at the beginning he is a chipper, a mere device, by the end of the story he is inextricably involved, a committed participant in the bizarre events.","popularity":0.7333,"poster_path":"/vPKwZ2XyQHKSGrxGfTCxR2uQEYc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbi s.f.","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":73100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magma Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":210,"logo_path":"/cuIR8m2nnKkqPgnQz25FJT26aBa.png","name":"Süddeutscher Rundfunk","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1989-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Glacier","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Under the Glacier","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Jäätikön jumalat","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La sorcière du glacier","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A jég alatt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Am Gletscher","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigurður Sigurjónsson","original_name":"Sigurður Sigurjónsson","popularity":0.2858,"profile_path":"/771PMUbylZqX4TbUmONzfOBhsSK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Umbi","credit_id":"54f18338c3a368322f0011b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":96525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baldvin Halldórsson","original_name":"Baldvin Halldórsson","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Séra Jón Prímus","credit_id":"54f1839cc3a368323200160b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":985416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margrét Helga Jóhannsdóttir","original_name":"Margrét Helga Jóhannsdóttir","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Úa","credit_id":"54f183a8c3a36832420011aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristbjörg Kjeld","original_name":"Kristbjörg Kjeld","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/6pLWMsIbWFaicJcAYjXZnspLaf9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hnallþóra","credit_id":"54f183b4c3a368323e001102","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helgi Skúlason","original_name":"Helgi Skúlason","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/neA65D57CCerXNf5C2Te9SLnD7K.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Godman Sýngmann","credit_id":"54f183c5c3a3683235001103","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Þórhallur Sigurðsson","original_name":"Þórhallur Sigurðsson","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/dDCwBRJBzsoGd0pNWUqg29WRPYF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jódínus Álfberg","credit_id":"54f183dc9251416b41001359","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rúrik Haraldsson","original_name":"Rúrik Haraldsson","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tumi Jónsen","credit_id":"54f183e7c3a36832450012ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sólveig Halldórsdóttir","original_name":"Sólveig Halldórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Fína Jónsen","credit_id":"54f183fc9251416b3b001148","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guðrún Þ.
