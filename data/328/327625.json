She returns with Nina, her baby, and adapts with difficulty to the rhythm of this small town. Hugo discovers his older sister, whose life he dreamed of, while Lou takes her return with simplicity, in the present, without asking herself any questions. Through this reunion, they realize that they have become adults, each one choosing a personal life path, each one aspiring to a different happiness than the others.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comme il vient","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaspard Manesse","original_name":"Gaspard Manesse","popularity":0.3417,"profile_path":"/dc23qG0yFB3VhDUntC6h3xnCxpE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hugo","credit_id":"54f08c1f92514179740082d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Perrot","original_name":"Laurence Perrot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lou","credit_id":"54f08c29925141796e00828c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Gourp","original_name":"Sophie Gourp","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"54f08c32c3a3686b9a005ffd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moussa Sanogo","original_name":"Moussa Sanogo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Seydou","credit_id":"54f08c3cc3a3686b9a006001","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432713,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rémi Mazet","original_name":"Rémi Mazet","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f08c979251417961008ce5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaspard Manesse","original_name":"Gaspard Manesse","popularity":0.3417,"profile_path":"/dc23qG0yFB3VhDUntC6h3xnCxpE.jpg","credit_id":"54f08c859251417961008ce1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196660,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christophe Chiesa","original_name":"Christophe Chiesa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f08c11925141796e008289","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0295204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
