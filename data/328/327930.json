Presented as the commentary track of a rushed reissue of a forgotten (but 100% genuine) Frankenstein film's DVD (because of unspecified 'recent events'), this project transforms the film into an entirely new, very human horror story. Featuring Clu Gulager as the director of the 1977 original who is happily exploiting the unmentioned tragedy linked to the film, the recording session unravels a mystery as he clashes with the screenwriter (Zack Brown) and, ultimately, its star (Leon Vitali from Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and Barry Lyndon, playing himself.) 'Terror of Frankenstein' is Mystery Science Theater 3000 by way of Sartre, an icy satire of the monsters onscreen, behind the camera, and in the audience.","popularity":0.5164,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66909,"logo_path":null,"name":"New City Road","origin_country":""},{"id":58674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highland Park Classics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Director's Commentary: Terror Of Frankenstein","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clu Gulager","original_name":"Clu Gulager","popularity":0.704,"profile_path":"/vIcvay2xPmaQJF78GWLcCCRf6no.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gavin Merrill (voice)","credit_id":"559a12b592514109db0029e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zack Norman","original_name":"Zack Norman","popularity":0.3187,"profile_path":"/2l9kFEev57u9xAuD43YBiDOdH4X.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"David Falks (voice)","credit_id":"559a12d1c3a3684baa002e83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Vitali","original_name":"Leon Vitali","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/6YHGAjJI0ra7F74UUZeSf5Qtcdd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leon Vitali (voice)","credit_id":"559a12e89251413d9600440d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Ascher","original_name":"Rodney Ascher","popularity":0.282,"profile_path":"/quRxjqaaG5DK7FSmh5Hb7hRSo47.jpg","credit_id":"559a13bcc3a3685e9b0030dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484900,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Kirk","original_name":"Jay Kirk","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559a134b9251413d99004006","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Kirk","original_name":"Tim Kirk","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559a1331c3a3685f1f002c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Kirk","original_name":"Tim Kirk","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559a141992514155e4002f34","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Ascher","original_name":"Rodney Ascher","popularity":0.282,"profile_path":"/quRxjqaaG5DK7FSmh5Hb7hRSo47.jpg","credit_id":"559a13edc3a3685f1f002ca8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Kirk","original_name":"Tim Kirk","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559a135d9251411d49002d76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4295226","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"terroroffrankenstein","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":196751,"name":"fictional biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasia International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Stanley Film Festival","release_date":"2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
