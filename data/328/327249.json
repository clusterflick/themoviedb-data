At high speed, La Rivière reconstructs the history of Rotterdam from the time before the bombings until now, and expands the developments to the year 2040 (100 years after the bombing and the 700th anniversary of the city).  La Rivière made a specific choice to expose his personal vision, which is sometimes radical or a little absurd. So no experts and no talking heads, but an assault of old and new imagery, held together by La Rivière as the narrator of the film.  Although Rotterdam 2040 deals with architecture and urban renewal, it is actually a film about people. The subjective experience of the city by its (future) occupants mainly determines the parade of architectural blunders and suggestions for the future. All tongue-in-cheek of course.","popularity":0.3482,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2013-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Neo-Neo-Classicism!","title":"Rotterdam 2040","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gyz La Rivière","original_name":"Gyz La Rivière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54edc652c3a3686d66004624","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311762,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Roza","original_name":"Tim Roza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54edc66bc3a36869e500168e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431614,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rufus Ketting","original_name":"Rufus Ketting","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54edc739c3a36869e500169a","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3465606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":6687,"name":"rotterdam"},{"id":9685,"name":"futuristic"},{"id":10616,"name":"urban"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":209591,"name":"people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
