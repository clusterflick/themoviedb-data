Dada Thakur (Chhabi Biswas) starts his career with a hand-operated press, with his wife as his assistant. Later he is joined by Nalini Kanta Sarkar, an underground freedom-fighter. Dada Thakur brings out the newspaper Jangipur Sangbad. He campaigns against social evils and earns the ire of the ruling classes. He saves a girl, Lata, from the unwanted advances of Darpanarayan (Biswajeet), scion of the local zamindar. Lata joins the ranks of freedom fighters working with Sarkar. Subsequently, a reformed Darpanarayan too becomes an ardent follower of Dada Thakur and joins the struggle for India's freedom. Dada Thakur's greatest success is when he helps an ordinary man, a petty shopkeeper, get elected as the Municipal Commissioner of Jangipur.","popularity":0.117,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dada Thakur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biswajeet Chatterjee","original_name":"Biswajit Chatterjee","popularity":0.2059,"profile_path":"/n0ncJ4xeBNkgqGh67HIbeimzQ1z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dada Thakur","credit_id":"571e6e03c3a36833aa000699","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biswajeet Chatterjee","original_name":"Biswajit Chatterjee","popularity":0.2059,"profile_path":"/n0ncJ4xeBNkgqGh67HIbeimzQ1z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Darpanarayan","credit_id":"571e6e0b9251416f2c00070b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chhabi Biswas","original_name":"Chhabi Biswas","popularity":0.1448,"profile_path":"/yUmZUJVPPxFyUDC53bvfKpDk7Dq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dada Thakur","credit_id":"571e6e1d9251416f3300069d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarun Kumar","original_name":"Tarun Kumar","popularity":0.3978,"profile_path":"/8LIRd8rqF4DgncQKdzw5czsVWtd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nalini Kanta Sarkar","credit_id":"571e6e2cc3a36833930007f1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sudhir Mukherjee","original_name":"Sudhir Mukherjee","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d6c7db109cd0004708f130","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610801,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shyamanand Jalan","original_name":"Shyamanand Jalan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/oZtnppKcAktRBsova2SkQ9Hg4NL.jpg","credit_id":"571e6df2c3a36833aa000690","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0055882","wikidata_id":"Q16247749","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
