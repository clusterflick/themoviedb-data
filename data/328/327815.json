An unfaithful remake of the musical cult classic The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Although the story is apparently the same, Shebl’s film is almost too homoerotic to handle. Weaved into its camp aesthetics, horror genre tropes and 80s disco numbers, Anyab provides a running commentary on the social situation in Egypt, from youth unemployment to class struggle, while intersecting sexual politics into the mix.","popularity":0.7356,"poster_path":"/fOeoMnEM9q6ceCLKxndvOESfipI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11574,"logo_path":"/rgUiPgpxE7oKPFgU3GEirqAWEXx.png","name":"MISR International
