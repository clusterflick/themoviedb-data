Through melody, image, color, and natural sound, his film constructs a look at the connecting world we live in—language, growth, time, man, and celebration; city, ocean, discovery, color, and light—in 25 non-linear sections. The music, composed and performed by Cotten, was created simultaneously with the film, underscoring an expression of the intrinsic duality of human perception. Cotten employs a system to create an emotional compass for the viewer using three primary colors: red for dark outlook, yellow for uncertainty, and blue for optimism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Globe as a Graph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Cotten","original_name":"Marcus Cotten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ee879c925141795f0052bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
