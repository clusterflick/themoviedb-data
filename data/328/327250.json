I have three definitions of the word Sincerity to sustain my working along these lines of thought with this autobiographical material: (1) Ezra Pound's marvelous mistranslation of a Chinese ideogram – Sincerity... the sun's lance coming to rest on the precise spot verbally...(of which I would change, for my purposes, the last word to visually), (2) Robert Creeley's trace-of-the-word for me on the back of a Buffalo restaurant menu Sym-keros... same-growth (Ceres) CREATE... of the same growth, and (3) Hollis Frampton's track-of-it to 'the greek', viz – 'a glazed pot (i. e. one which will hold water).' This film might best be seen, then, as a graph of light equivalent to autobiographical thought process.","popularity":0.1559,"poster_path":"/5DWIbwIUEi2kR0XE07utAEFNWFE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sincerity I","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sincerity","type":"(on-screen title, I added for clarity)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"54edbdf8c3a3680b800040f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0278718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5DWIbwIUEi2kR0XE07utAEFNWFE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Millennium Film Workshop","release_date":"1973-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
