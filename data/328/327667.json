McGowan, actors Francis Ford and Joe Bonomo (a carnival strongman-turned-actor), producer Trem Carr (who would later help found Monogram Pictures), and a slew of silent-era supporting icons such as Ruth Hiatt, Grace Cunard, and more. Chapter names like “The Clutching Claw,” “The Devil’s Dice, “Galloping Fury,” and “The Invisible Hand” offer all one needs to know of the film’s concerns: to promise and deliver as much action and suspense as possible, and move our intrepid hero and heroine from one perilous situation to another. One of the biggest stars of the early silent era and a successful serials director in his own right, Francis Ford was the brother of director John Ford.","popularity":0.3543,"poster_path":"/rhRPhZqnD9lRh98QBWqaax9WwFC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trem Carr Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chinatown Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bonomo","original_name":"Joe Bonomo","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/9iUlrtqxErFBCUVxnRhIoJYNE37.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joe Masters","credit_id":"6228d038d2c0c1001c12f395","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Hiatt","original_name":"Ruth Hiatt","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/86Vr473rt3xe4EIrfw71GmbKdCu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sally Warren, Chemist","credit_id":"6228d045c1606a0067dc7f0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ford","original_name":"Francis Ford","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/v5MKJZbr5kwP7KbLjNgw7Bqwsto.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Sphinx","credit_id":"6228d05255c1f4001a599e7d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d05c1130bd001bc0dd29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheldon Lewis","original_name":"Sheldon Lewis","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":"/zsgNwtpLXyYSFJU0XeNECvVDlh9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d064e92d830048425e4a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Shields","original_name":"Ernest Shields","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/iSOMVMqU9N07Jyam1skxQsxlMxT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d06ca6d931001cc17c11","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Richardson","original_name":"Jack Richardson","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/VS5D9sFzk4KTeFjsL1Y15Ck4yb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d077871b340071c52ad8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":981642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Cunard","original_name":"Grace Cunard","popularity":0.3076,"profile_path":"/o1Dc87jVxUVdpFjezs0TjEZeURv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d07e1130bd0067c6a706","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d0861bf2660019acaabd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy O'Day","original_name":"Peggy O'Day","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3yBIILpzAsgj5navAL2Fti4DYka.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d08ee92d830048425ea1","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1355998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duke Worne","original_name":"Duke Worne","popularity":0.196,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d09628723c001b68df8a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gibson","original_name":"Helen Gibson","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/28xE4tpapbbEjpby7nv7IAWacSg.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d0a101757f0048c0a5e1","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30410,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Malvern","original_name":"Paul Malvern","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6228d0a955c1f4007014e243","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Baffert","original_name":"Al Baffert","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Crook","credit_id":"6228d0b41bf266004618c2f7","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.P.
