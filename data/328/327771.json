Focusing on the Akko Theater Center's award-winning performance, ARBEIT MACHT FREI, also featured in the German documentary, BALAGAN (see listing), he documents the actors as well as the audiences over a three-year period, scrutinizing their souls. Tlalim travels with the Israeli actors to Morocco, to the Czech Republic and finally to Germany, where they compare one society that chooses to remember with one that chooses to forget.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Touch My Holocaust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asher Tlalim","original_name":"Asher Tlalim","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54f1794d9251416b2f001141","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
