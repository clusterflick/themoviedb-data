Each song on this DVD is a jewel. I enjoyed his brief introductions to explain or translate some of the lyrics, setting the mood. Notable among them is \"Mon Ã©mouvant amour\" during which he uses sign language. The selections offer us a broad spectrum of emotion and life - love (of course), frustration, lost opportunity, reflection, homosexuality, religion. The orchestra and backup vocalists are flawless. Although he's performed for decades, I got the feeling that he still loves to interact with his audience. Although in his early 70's when this concert was recorded, his passion, supreme musicality, stamina, and professionalism are evident at all times. This DVD is a \"must-have\" for newcomers and longtime fans!","popularity":0.1987,"poster_path":"/vTg01zJoJ6pK5jwO9PTPRDbghBA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a wonderful addition to all Aznavour fans!","title":"Charles Aznavour - Aznavour Live Au Carnegie Hall","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Charles Aznavour - Aznavour Live Au Carnegie Hall (2001)","type":"dvd"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Aznavour","original_name":"Charles Aznavour","popularity":0.5153,"profile_path":"/yC3yv9Z8J8v4UteLFiDIx97fKYx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54f09580c3a3687be20019eb","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":781,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTg01zJoJ6pK5jwO9PTPRDbghBA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
