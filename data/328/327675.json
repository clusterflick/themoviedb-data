At that time, just about everything had already been said about Brecker's trumpeting skills and projects. He joined Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears in 1966, then moved on to Horace Silver's Quintet for 3 years. Later, he and his brother formed the mythical Brecker Brothers who presented the fusion between Jazz and Rock during the eighties. The many thousands of fans of this irresistibly charming introvert still remember the precise, powerful and soft sound of Brecker's superb improvisations. This DVD is a prime example of his talent.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Randy Brecker - The Geneva Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
