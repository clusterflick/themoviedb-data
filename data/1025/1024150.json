La Cultura gathers all street cultures and promote various aspects of counter-cultural music, literature and other arts. Within this context, they open a boxing school as well, proposing another form of playing sports in response to a selfish, racist and homophobic system. LCDB thus becomes the first and only anti-fascist sports and social club in Latin America.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ybX2LM7lO4yBvg1riwjjLRITosE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L.C.D.B. - El documental","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149251,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gastón Marin","original_name":"Gastón Marin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320da0a226c56007d413c12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149251,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gastón Marin","original_name":"Gastón Marin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643e98f243250f049c513a6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4016437,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eliana Agüero","original_name":"Eliana Agüero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643e98f8d7a70a0314ab393c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1149251,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gastón Marin","original_name":"Gastón Marin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643e9904c7176d050898c2d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9191794","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ybX2LM7lO4yBvg1riwjjLRITosE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mrN9bYHH4CtGn7LOML9jnYC7MyB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1344}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
