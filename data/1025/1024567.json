Hiers and sons, both now owned and operated by Donald Hiers, the son of Claude Hiers, and the grandson of L. M. Hiers. He is quiet, always a smile on his face, a grin in his demeanor, and unobtrusive. \"But he can be talkative,\" as one Ehrhardt native describes him. Hiers (Donald) was born and raised in Ehrhardt, but probably raised more in the 5 and 10 (five and dime) and the grocery store, than on the playgrounds and sand lots of Ehrhardt. Hiers is also a 1954 graduate of Ehrhardt High School and the Citadel in 1959.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ehrhard Five and Dime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Woodward","original_name":"Stan Woodward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632259111b722c007fedd3d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
