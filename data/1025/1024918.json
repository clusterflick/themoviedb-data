The forest was independent and autonomous. Things have changed. The filmmakers observe a forest warden doing his job in the forest with love and care. He answers the questions asked by Fred JÃ¼ssi, contemplates on the connections between man and environment and explains human responsibility for taking care of the forest. The forest warden considers himself as a part of the big chain called nature protection.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qJBcQtz9Ai8syQtRiwiC126JT50.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest and the Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2982425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reet Kasesalu","original_name":"Reet Kasesalu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6323acc3ae6f09007f27a400","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3702346,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ott Kool","original_name":"Ott Kool","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6323acfe8d22fc0082bb8408","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3702347,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harri Martinson","original_name":"Harri Martinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6323ad623d3557008422bc50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2490316,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anti Marguste","original_name":"Anti Marguste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6323ad7b33ad8f007d1dabc1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12136808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJBcQtz9Ai8syQtRiwiC126JT50.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":715}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
