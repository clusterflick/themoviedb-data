The film uses a variety unconventional image making and hand-printing strategies to achieve its hi-contrast jittery style including contact printing with a mag-light taped to a sync block and hand-processing in a bucket. No conventional motion picture processes/tools/labs were used. The film is meant to be played/looped at 24fps with the soundtrack provided by the image.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4STsnYAca4fHff0HXohGFGfTLBf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ENOLAEMEVAEL/LEAVEMEALONE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathryn Ramey","original_name":"Kathryn Ramey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320f237a4af8f007bebc21d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4STsnYAca4fHff0HXohGFGfTLBf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
