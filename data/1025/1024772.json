They contained tens of thousands of archaeological remnants worth around £7 million. Three of the crates were sent to forensic archaeologists Dr Christos Tsirogiannis and Dr Vinnie Norskov for research. An Excavation documents Tsirogiannis and Norskov’s investigation into a series of vases from the Geneva Freeport crates. Made in the 4th century BC by Apulian artisans, these vases remained buried in tombs for 2500 years before they were clandestinely excavated from their now irrecoverable contexts. The objects’ journeys through the hands of looters, smugglers, restorers and dealers are counterpointed by the hand-painted stories that adorn them. Made for burials, the vases depict scenes from the underworld – forensic and mythological narratives start to intertwine.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":"/otleIbCN1Z3bqzNW37NkfyTZRK7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Excavation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinnie Norskov","original_name":"Vinnie Norskov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67374078ffe3878e9e9fbd26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christos Tsirogiannis","original_name":"Christos Tsirogiannis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67374083d63fed5826cf5323","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1806929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maeve Brennan","original_name":"Maeve Brennan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632340cfae6f09007f2788e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ali Roche","original_name":"Ali Roche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737408fc62c3a26ad056309","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Beatrice Dillon","original_name":"Beatrice Dillon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673740986bd4889bfbc7a89a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Quantrill","original_name":"Jamie Quantrill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673740a5ce49410032c1f678","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349432,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ariadna Fatjó-Vilas","original_name":"Ariadna Fatjó-Vilas","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673740ccce49410032c1f6aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20246828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gbHCWA85qupZyJcdxObWwrdFXgg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1593,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/otleIbCN1Z3bqzNW37NkfyTZRK7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
