Serving crowds too large for church buildings or homes, the camp ground responded to both religious and social needs. A vestige of the Great Awakening in American religious life at the start of the nineteenth century, it has had uninterrupted use as a site for revivalism for almost 200 years. It is one of only a few camp grounds in South Carolina to still host annual week-long camp meetings.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cypress Camp Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Woodward","original_name":"Stan Woodward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63217a2cfd4a96007a279b76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
