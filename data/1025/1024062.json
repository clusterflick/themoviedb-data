A film that is born as a child, like the one she has not had: free, insecure and worried.  When depression and the feeling of emptiness set in, it is her mother, with her salvation machine, who steps in to help. A family documentary about the power of the bond, love and loneliness.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":"/isqEZK61jbtldLDeHtM1R6Mh5Tf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Una mujer con un paraguas roto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610792,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ander Duque","original_name":"Ander Duque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320aa51180dea007a8c7005","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/isqEZK61jbtldLDeHtM1R6Mh5Tf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
