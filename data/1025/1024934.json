In this black comedy, the main character's fundamental resolve to do the right thing collides with the tragicomic absurdity of corrupt or incompetent attorneys, damaged, unbalanced clients, and a catastrophically broken family-law system. Pilot Synopsis: Tommy Laudadio, an altruistic law-school grad paying a steep price for a big mistake, is beyond desperate for a job. At an interview with a divorce firm he observes the owner and his henchman bullying and cheating clients; while trying to help the clients Tommy comes face to face with tragicomic absurdity of the entire family-law system. This might be Tommy's last chance to save his future-but it's clear he will have to sacrifice every principle he lives by if he wants to grab it.","popularity":0.3633,"poster_path":"/gEF08QP2eb77ya0FIM7SqJsFRDm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inferno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Bywater","original_name":"Josh Bywater","popularity":0.1027,"profile_path":"/lmDyJXwTsqEOyD9MGiaUgWY2vU0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tommy Laudadio","credit_id":"6323b600226c56007cda0527","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pasquesi","original_name":"David Pasquesi","popularity":0.3876,"profile_path":"/oQplec891LMv0wndTtKh1bIS11Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leonard Gregory","credit_id":"6323b60ebb2602007d01787b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2227927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Wesley Brown","original_name":"Adam Wesley Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vince Morrow","credit_id":"6323b61cfd4a96009184ed64","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133534,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Lister","original_name":"John Lister","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Archie Divine","credit_id":"6323b62b7a1bd6007e275630","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3702365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marika Engelhardt","original_name":"Marika Engelhardt","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rebecca Wolfson","credit_id":"6323b6377a1bd6007bc93764","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ty Olwin","original_name":"Ty Olwin","popularity":0.1926,"profile_path":"/pCXNCFZr1dIGrjvyl4lgS4rlrfQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Whitaker Whitney III","credit_id":"6323b644db154f007abd08c5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2276390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Sengenberger","original_name":"Rose Sengenberger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gBARrw61KRCC3j7PmQJU040BIQM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lucy Syracuse","credit_id":"6323b65e3d3557007c12667b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Murphy","original_name":"Leslie Murphy","popularity":0.1965,"profile_path":"/sEWkzjMT1olkxZVTAptfoLqra2o.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Brandi Carter","credit_id":"6323b66f8d22fc007fb8038a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3702366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald L.
