Time is running out—it's not too late.","popularity":0.0893,"poster_path":"/dxP7ZPpVftf7KMS46CdMFy6CQfI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odyssey 2050","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklin Chang-Diaz","original_name":"Franklin Chang-Diaz","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/2XPBnenrDjCDrVHWsfyCUJInWDY.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669ef7ebbcada463a6bf2428","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jair Cruz","original_name":"Jair Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6320cdbe6905fb007d6c2759","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Lewis","original_name":"Carlos Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6320cdcdbefd910082ffc1ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3699618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanzell Carballo","original_name":"Hanzell Carballo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sM652S0FLmM6CenxzBe7RvVnhid.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6320cdd8bdd568008656a678","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Callow","original_name":"Bruce Callow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6320cde2befd910082ffc1ba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douglas Williamson","original_name":"Douglas Williamson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6320cdefbdd568007e9e4566","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Campbell","original_name":"Sharon Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6320ce0c1f3e6000822ac831","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Facchini","original_name":"Gabriel Facchini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6320ce166905fb007d6c277d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harris Montero","original_name":"Harris Montero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320ce6ed05a03007ede7c9e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Callow","original_name":"Bruce Callow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320ce7bd05a03007ede7ca1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Callow","original_name":"Bruce Callow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320ce49d05a03007ede7c91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3699622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Bermejo","original_name":"Daniel Bermejo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6320ce345ca7040083bff494","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dxP7ZPpVftf7KMS46CdMFy6CQfI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Odyssey 2050 Climate Change Film","key":"1bQMfAQXrEo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2012-06-26T21:04:33.000Z","id":"6320cf8722931a0091bc5c33"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Odyssey 2050 en Español","key":"1z_GZtOYZUQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-05-30T23:22:02.000Z","id":"6320cfa2226c560091802dc8"}]}}}
