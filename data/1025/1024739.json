Its daily existence is built around habits and it is perfectly at ease with that. A disturbing companion, like a maleficent double, warns it of an imminent threat and the reality seems very different. Bunches of grapes placed on a bench evaporate as if by magic, ushering in the threatening arrival of a giant fugu fish. Marble becomes steel, glass becomes fabric, brick becomes wood. About these unexplained phenomena, the cat chats freely in its scatty, casual way. It is determined to stand at the frontier between reality and fiction. A tragi-comic quest for identity, at the intersection of the surrealist worlds of Lewis Carroll, the light of Edward Hopper and the memes of the post-digital age.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rhk2ohIwfrW7oeK6M2wYsfBWxYR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":"/gW6YiDdhkySff27C0m4JXu30879.png","name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be Maybe May","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3701852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Jonvaux","original_name":"Olivier Jonvaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63231dfb511d09007ac9d55f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhk2ohIwfrW7oeK6M2wYsfBWxYR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
