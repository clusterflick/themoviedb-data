This is the story of a family...  This is the story of my disabled brother...  In fact, I think it's the story of a storm...  I was 11 when my brother was born.  It was August 30, 1977.  It was the first time I saw my father cry.  It was necessary to pray and above all, to be very wise.  That's when my dad stopped talking and my mom stopped laughing.","popularity":0.1301,"poster_path":"/7u58wYfqBMMc5sCVrE2FvqdBArh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coop Vidéo de Montréal","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037327,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"André-Line Beauparlant","original_name":"André-Line Beauparlant","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6321ea593d3557008e920c15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81743,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Josée Deshaies","original_name":"Josée Deshaies","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/hk4SZbga6uRr7X1hI6RiU3nCwwx.jpg","credit_id":"6321ea73e78687008446a1f4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598285,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcel Chouinard","original_name":"Marcel Chouinard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6321ea83db154f00985fc4fd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":196044,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martine Allard","original_name":"Martine Allard","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6321ea93e78687008446a204","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998816,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sophie Leblond","original_name":"Sophie Leblond","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/5BLC8NeOSTGFBAiycKRwKltyIbZ.jpg","credit_id":"6321eaa25a5ed000848cc60a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037327,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"André-Line Beauparlant","original_name":"André-Line Beauparlant","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6321eab01b722c007fedb802","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2445596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle LeBlanc","original_name":"Danielle LeBlanc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5tnQIn1fGQIXWKzyMCrl456T5bV.jpg","credit_id":"6321eacbe78687007f2c5218","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.761,"height":790,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7u58wYfqBMMc5sCVrE2FvqdBArh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":601}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
