Set in the lavish nature of mount Sinjar, the film observes the psychological impact of war and atrocities on the young Yazidi girl and her family. At the tender age of twelve, Safia assumes the role of a mother rather than a carefree child. The film is a poetic depiction of life in the shadows of conflict.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/qxIkUxhm24CWxW7TMUvwn9c3vV3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2863089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Abd","original_name":"Ahmed Abd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616203a633ec260028ef117e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14912832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qxIkUxhm24CWxW7TMUvwn9c3vV3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
