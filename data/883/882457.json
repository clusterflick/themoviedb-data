He laughs at his animal mates devoting time to collecting and depositing food in their local bank. Winter arrives and Willie, starving and cold, tries to withdraw food from the bank. The teller can find no record of any deposits for Willie. Dejected, Willie looks on as the other animals eat heartily and stay warm in their cosy homes. Willie collapses from hunger in the snow, but his friends come to the rescue just in time. The following summer Willie, having learned his lesson, deposits food in the bank with dedication and enthusiasm.","popularity":0.299,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eric Porter Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1939-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waste Not, Want Not","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3263349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lance Watkinson","original_name":"Lance Watkinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61606ba01d35630060c4e6be","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Porter","original_name":"Eric Porter","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61606b4933ec2600653f4e58","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3263348,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Kay","original_name":"John Kay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61606b9050733c008bd16cbc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Porter","original_name":"Eric Porter","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61606aacb865eb0025322842","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":264141,"name":"wombat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1939-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
