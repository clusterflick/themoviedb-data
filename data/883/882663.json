The future of this natural environment is under pressure, because of conflicting political interests. Ur shows how political decision­ making influences the formation of landscapes. The film gives a voice to the people who have been involved in the disappearance and the future of this forest, from the Polish government to lawyers of Client Earth as well as the European Commission.
