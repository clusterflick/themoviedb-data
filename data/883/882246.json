The sense of departure of the autumn of 1989 slowly gives way to disappointments about the outcome of the People’s Chamber elections in 1990, the currency reform and the Unification Treaty. The political and social changes took place at a rapid pace that many found hard to follow. The sense of community that carried people through 1989 is fading. “Now it’s every man for himself”, Alexander states. He has no use for capitalism: “I feel just as lied to and cheated as before.” Resignation spreads.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/mrCG9I0tVXgBwIMhpoVNT1Eezjb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Übergang – Protokoll einer Hoffnung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1580825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Tetzlaff","original_name":"Kurt Tetzlaff","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6299d7e17ad08c00500c1229","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2903300,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Monika Schäfer","original_name":"Monika Schäfer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6299d8015507e9149754c645","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1580825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Tetzlaff","original_name":"Kurt Tetzlaff","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615fc2bd635013006209f159","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":824,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mrCG9I0tVXgBwIMhpoVNT1Eezjb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
