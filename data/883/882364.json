La Plaine, a lively district, a large square, a historic and popular market.  A tumultuous battle between, on the one hand, the city council's urban planning services, determined to carry out a major program of \"requalification\" of the district. On the other hand, a part of the residents, who refuse this gentrification operation, and demand to be associated to the decisions. This epic story lasts 3 years and ends abruptly with the incredible construction of a concrete wall of 2m50 high all around the square.  The television of the district, imprinted with the stories of past uprisings, a tool of counter-propaganda throughout this battle, refuses to stop at the report of a defeat and wonders.  Summoning the Free Communes of 1871, their joyful and fiery rage, a singular writing takes hold of the fiction. In order to make this collective struggle a victorious human adventure, another way of making the city and the world is envisaged.","popularity":0.0339,"poster_path":"/92CFwdPE10W0Bcpid1PxKEW0y3a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The battle of La Plaine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Hakenholz","original_name":"Thomas Hakenholz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61645b979d592c00441ef571","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1695339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Burlaud","original_name":"Nicolas Burlaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61645b8a62fcd300634bf236","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2361630,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Ach","original_name":"Sandra Ach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61645b7fcee4810043b72734","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15663626","wikidata_id":"Q111295436","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8m5YtYmZIZWEqmJZyZduy8Vw5r0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/92CFwdPE10W0Bcpid1PxKEW0y3a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
