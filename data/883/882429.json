Erma, neutral: Principles or motives that guide one's behavior or actions. A film about gender, the body and all their intertwining moments in between. Through an abstract stop-motion / body horror narrative point of view it attempts to highlight the continuous process and struggle of the construction of gender subjectivity against the oppressive power of heteronormativity. From birth to death the error in the code of patriarchy is subjugated and resisted, emerging but also trapped by the erinyes of the social. With an ironic and critical mood and intense religious symbolism, Erma highlights the contradictions of gender composition both in the field of solitary subjectivity and in the dominant heteronormative narrative. Gender identity is a war waged in the trenches of the body.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/y2PqBZBNglxdakedQlW5KsJuudT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle
