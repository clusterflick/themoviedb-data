No one knew whether it was a suicide or an accident. The director investigates around the town, asks different inhabitants what they think of that tragedy. For many people, Jean-Michel had killed himself, after amassing too many worries and problems; the more the voiceover asks, the more mysterious it all gets. But there is a detail from Jean-Michel’s life that connects him to Argentina—he had been an employee at a phone company until a privatization left him without a job. (In)Voluntary Retirements is a documentary that shows how the kinship between Argentina’s politics in the ‘90s and France’s twenty years later damaged the lives of so many people.","popularity":0.1348,"poster_path":"/FErEJgLwueJsHID0HhykRbML3a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ojo Blindado","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":115668,"logo_path":null,"name":"996 films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(In)Voluntary Retirements","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gugliotta","original_name":"Sandra Gugliotta","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/401TChfSUrePPF5uRSySPda06VG.jpg","credit_id":"5faddb92924ce600416d19a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Gugliotta","original_name":"Sandra Gugliotta","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/401TChfSUrePPF5uRSySPda06VG.jpg","credit_id":"5faec24cb686b9003d87dea7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545676,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Armin Marchesini Weihmuller","original_name":"Armin Marchesini Weihmuller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faec2878e87020040949ab5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854979,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Juan Aguirre ","original_name":"Juan Aguirre ","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faec2940d9f5a004206b2fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2722357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Zeballos","original_name":"Miguel Zeballos","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faec2661d3143003d9bf140","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854978,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Juan Loustaunau","original_name":"Juan Loustaunau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faec2707ecd28003dbaab26","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468099,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carole Sainsard","original_name":"Carole Sainsard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faec27cfdc146003c6db676","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13519018","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/FErEJgLwueJsHID0HhykRbML3a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"35º Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
