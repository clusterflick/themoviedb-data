It turns out that the roots of Ukrainian hockey go back over a century. Ukrainian hockey players from immigrant families gained world fame while playing for teams in their new homeland. Meanwhile, they continued to maintain their language and culture. Throughout the 100-year existence of the NHL, more than fifty Ukrainians became champions of the League. This is the largest number of champions representing a non-North American nationality. Even the best hockey player of all times, Wayne Gretzky, is of Ukrainian descent.","popularity":0.5357,"poster_path":"/bfa9PifiKqPIaGzCRiFs6ZAr1rM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145545,"logo_path":null,"name":"TeleProstir
