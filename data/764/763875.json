In truth, the president known as Ol' Tippecanoe actually rewrote American history. How did he do this? By faking his death and joining ranks with a shadow government known only as the Fraternity, which was, until recently, the most super secret conspiracy ever assembled: That is, until it stopped being a secret when a young female reporter found out and had the guts to report it. The Triumph of William Henry Harrison is the story of our ninth president, but it is also the story of Amanda Delacourt.","popularity":0.5428,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Triumph of William Henry Harrison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Asner","original_name":"Ed Asner","popularity":1.4062,"profile_path":"/uj5TQBVb1jdPrvSEdwjzT6DRmqi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa501f748b00848769ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3655323,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Crabb","original_name":"David Crabb","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa59a1074b00920f9442","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Glick","original_name":"Daniel Glick","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa5fcee2f60082959881","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radhika Vaz","original_name":"Radhika Vaz","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa6adf857c007fb07b48","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3631229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Donnelly","original_name":"Matt Donnelly","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/cqbxhFwHl6xUNgWBVv8kRHH2bhc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa7985b1050085244ec3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Jackson","original_name":"Jamie Jackson","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":"/tPLCxTwmlwu1BbT1sRta4BZ2ynT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa8077e1f600824cbf01","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2242656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Rozanski","original_name":"Kristen Rozanski","popularity":0.1195,"profile_path":"/hqKxjeQFQi1TZeIz3EzbGdVZxNO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fa921f748b008116126a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3655325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Lazar","original_name":"Gerald Lazar","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0faa5d207f3007fd0385e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chance Mullen","original_name":"Chance Mullen","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fab51f748b008116127d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3655326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Schmieder","original_name":"Amanda Schmieder","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62f0fac085b1050080255db5","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Glick","original_name":"Daniel Glick","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ef924377e1f600824c5a55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337065","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: YouTube (Trailer Release)","release_date":"2010-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
