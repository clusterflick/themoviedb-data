Short clips shot on DS8mm are arranged in a tiled, grid-like structure that evokes the stacks of roofing slates once produced in the old quarry. The distorted drone and clattering slates of the soundtrack heighten the sense of a surreal and overbearing atmosphere.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":"/nct8JBwCvV7El8iFGnzH0QR9JC7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Barlow","original_name":"John Barlow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sTqVvADeqTf6jpb5BnLE9AthPS4.jpg","credit_id":"5fae5a71c613ce003d21a0d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nct8JBwCvV7El8iFGnzH0QR9JC7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2019-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts","release_date":"2019-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moviate Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Slate (Trailer)","key":"378162371","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-12-08T22:02:35.000Z","id":"5fae5a88245dbe003e6a3bbe"}]}}}
