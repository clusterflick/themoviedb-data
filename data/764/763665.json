The central government decided to confine the memory of the Revolution to museums. In this climate of forgetfulness, some scenes detached from reality bring the past to the present. Two young roofers, Nikita and Karl, explore the city, search for historical remains and specific places, climb the roofs. In their wandering they find abandoned buildings and balconies. Katya, an apparently older woman, walks through one of the capital spaces of the revolutionary process: the Champ de Mars, in St. Petersburg. Katya tells about the February Revolution, which ended the Romanov dynasty. It recalls the post-revolutionary period and rescues the figure of one of the most interesting intellectuals and scientists of the time: Aleksandr Bogdanov, author of a utopian science fiction book called Red Star.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/AlaO9KBQomADZVkzkoRpstCZwqm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afuera Producciones","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":139361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Punto de Fuga Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Star","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofía Bordenave","original_name":"Sofía Bordenave","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abf7c595a560029b89f58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303091,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manuel Rapoport","original_name":"Manuel Rapoport","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abf9d2f266b0043edecbe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martín Sappia","original_name":"Martín Sappia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abfa72cde98004251e9b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2665447,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Atilio Sánchez","original_name":"Atilio Sánchez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abfaf2f266b0043edecee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303092,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antú Honik","original_name":"Antú Honik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abfb98c7b0f00915cb811","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303093,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Camila Lorenzo","original_name":"Camila Lorenzo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abfc06e0d72008ff4757f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3303091,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manuel Rapoport","original_name":"Manuel Rapoport","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abfca1cfe3a008d539e41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Cáceres","original_name":"Eva Cáceres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618abfd4b076e500913c9d63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofía Bordenave","original_name":"Sofía Bordenave","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faddf67c613ce003e20ad7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/umJLcaszbPLaoyeNSB2ow54bCWn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/AlaO9KBQomADZVkzkoRpstCZwqm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":904,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/g2kX9EmYzxcCiHkvXO9t0Or7aKN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":604},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/lqUlyjkJalRh0RSU7equFPv3sPQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"36º Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
