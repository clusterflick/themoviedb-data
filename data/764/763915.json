The only catch? The deadline is in three weeks! They’re joined by their two actress friends, Susan and Heidi, and their music director, Larry but they hit another roadblock… What should they write about? They decide it’s best to “write what you know,” and set off on a unique musical adventure: writing a musical about writing a musical. As the deadline looms, insecurities creep in, and jealousies flare. Will the team succeed with their musical? Could it even win a Tony?! Frequently hilarious, occasionally heartbreaking, and thoroughly inspiring, this uplifting show celebrates individuality and creativity.","popularity":0.4902,"poster_path":"/7XxzqFfOaf6uMJCKxIv8rY1Ds3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[title of show]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1229079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenna Russell","original_name":"Jenna Russell","popularity":0.1349,"profile_path":"/o2OpiQqEvg5yHj4Ura6jkIe1G2D.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"5faed895344a8e003c46b161","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Elliott","original_name":"Marc Elliott","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/cXjtHCAllsWAN85OUGeO6b0s4v9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"5faed8c0470ead0042075d32","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2730196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyrone Huntley","original_name":"Tyrone Huntley","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/pLR9w6mzaf3yvp1IsPraLKXOVb6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hunter","credit_id":"5faed8d7590086004055a4f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Jones","original_name":"Lucie Jones","popularity":0.4402,"profile_path":"/da4GU7x7fz3Q28vuf0wrxxa4Ebe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Heidi","credit_id":"5faed9012b9320004072de19","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Seymour","original_name":"Josh Seymour","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64136ebbede1b028e84e279a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7XxzqFfOaf6uMJCKxIv8rY1Ds3d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
