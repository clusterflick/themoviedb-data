In 1966, Duncan tries to break up an argument between white and Black teenagers outside a newly integrated school. He gently lays his hand on a white boy’s arm. The boy recoils like a snake. That night, police burst into Duncan’s trailer and arrest him for assault on a minor. A young Jewish attorney, Richard Sobol, leaves his prestigious D.C. firm to volunteer in New Orleans. With his help, Duncan bravely stands up to a racist legal system powered by a white supremacist boss to challenge his unfair arrest. Their fight goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and their lifelong friendship is forged.","popularity":0.7926,"poster_path":"/cq8icdIzX7arjWXylnvX6C2GpTK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Augusta Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":53215,"logo_path":"/mh9B1AdYWT9KxHOHC0k8TfTVzsv.png","name":"Get Lifted Film Co.","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"},{"id":118155,"logo_path":"/1lBVhKMuTT2HXSCOgax07aWSik5.png","name":"Shout!
