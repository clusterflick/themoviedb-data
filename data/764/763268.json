The recent arrival in Brazil of two new forms of prevention – PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) and PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis), drugs that promise greater efficacy against HIV/Aids transmission and contagion – enable an intense exercise of sexual practices, bringing new forms of care beyond the use of condoms. Through an intimate and observational record, the film strips of all moral judgement to dive into the user’s daily lives of PrEP, bringing up reflections about desire, sex and protection.","popularity":0.1103,"poster_path":"/mFCazSW3JUhnJdZvjD4dvjgQktK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51306,"logo_path":"/xy998HlkaZYCoxPhUKYSu09tg1H.png","name":"Modo
