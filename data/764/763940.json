The smells of the business - cheeses, sausages, garlic and pickled herrings - repulses Fernie, who dreams of leaving this environment and moving into a life that's more rarified. Her father, Pop Schmidt (Jean Hersholt) has plans for his daughter to marry Peter Halitovsky (Arthur Stone), a sausage salesman, but Fernie is repulsed by the idea. At a dance, Fernie meets Jack Dugan (Malcolm McGregor), who tells her that he is in stocks, a paper-counter, and she falls for him. Because of her rejection of her father's chosen candidate for matrimony, Pop puts Fernie out of the house.","popularity":0.3653,"poster_path":"/m3wExgAOHGJh30K2HgSlaKw5lou.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42184,"logo_path":null,"name":"John McCormick Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Must Be Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Moore","original_name":"Colleen Moore","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/zWnl0isnoRAUCOmZmYvJMqo8FBk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fernie Schmidt","credit_id":"5faee0fd326c190040ced6dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pop Schmidt","credit_id":"5faee12005a533003ec0e474","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm McGregor","original_name":"Malcolm McGregor","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/dwZptn0TCRGtGdKS039f5opo91b.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack Dugan","credit_id":"5faee1347a4ee7003eb4a26e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1439031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Seastrom","original_name":"Dorothy Seastrom","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/fG7h6JuLPzTtQNff5IP1nRwMjXU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Min","credit_id":"5faee146fcec2e003ffebe16","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary O'Brien","original_name":"Mary O'Brien","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lois","credit_id":"5faee15bd7dcd200411a15a6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Stone","original_name":"Arthur Stone","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/Atc2Evwa5qQIDvbTlYrfOOEUfSF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Peter Halitovsky","credit_id":"61c51de6b6c264008eede8ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bodil Rosing","original_name":"Bodil Rosing","popularity":0.1743,"profile_path":"/rjaNRj7emocErFxh58ijWPP1OQs.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mom Schmidt","credit_id":"61c51df52ac499004197e584","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleve Moore","original_name":"Cleve Moore","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/2ic3M0s7ZXvIfSAEyH7D7P84YxA.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Al","credit_id":"61c51e02b6c264008eede945","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Hallor","original_name":"Ray Hallor","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":"/fhoSAvVnhJspRMR69w5ulF7vuF3.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"61c51e0d33ad8f009929ce77","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":97986,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julien Josephson","original_name":"Julien Josephson","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c51d8abb1057001abecbe4","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Wagner","original_name":"Rob Wagner","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c51dc6efd3c200608efb7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3356806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brooke Hanlon","original_name":"Brooke Hanlon","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c51d80ecaef5006796e5bc","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred E.
