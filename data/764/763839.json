María, a 35-year-old Argentinian, recently separated from her partner, and her daughter Isabel, a six-year-old Catalan who is starting school, live there through some black hole in the rents. They are visited by Iara, sister of one and aunt of the other, and several of their friends. As we watch María and Isabel interact with their loved ones, the film sensibly explores the interior and exterior spaces that make up those relationships.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/dtG3ft7arodawpcIavTYsFch3iJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La escuela del bosque","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1744758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermina Pico","original_name":"Guillermina Pico","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vjn2jWDl0i5oivI7rUoAigbFxzX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea267c613ce003e222e42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel García Ponzoda","original_name":"Isabel García Ponzoda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea276ad59b5003e5aacbb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro García Schnetzer","original_name":"Alejandro García Schnetzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea284245dbe003e6a9a7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2214925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macarena Fernández","original_name":"Macarena Fernández","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea293c86b3a004268733e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oblit Baseiria","original_name":"Oblit Baseiria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea2a50d9f5a0042068870","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820411,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"América Sánchez","original_name":"América Sánchez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea2b97776f00042518166","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martín Tognola","original_name":"Martín Tognola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5faea2c57a97ab003fce2ed6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonzalo Castro","original_name":"Gonzalo Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faea23ab686b9003e879582","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13515532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9TKDKr5gHQQ348Zi8T89F4U1PzQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dtG3ft7arodawpcIavTYsFch3iJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":859}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"35 Festival de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2020-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La escuela del Bosque -  Clip Promo","key":"476934981","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-08T21:40:14.000Z","id":"5faea2052b93200041724d19"}]}}}
