Power is firmly in the corner of the one who makes the narratives today. Using the coastline as a metaphor, the photographs veer from violent scenes to the everyday absurdity of life – the viewer never sure of what is real and what is not. The character of an ‘idiot photographer’ also makes an appearance in self reference as Hura is all too aware of his own role in the violence and manipulation of image making today.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cDmGD49wDQ3ruKhnQkLkkrm2aHo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2614416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohrab Hura","original_name":"Sohrab Hura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fae4b41b686b9004087ca2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5DYLEBdjHBNIhfeSZT7W1bouscv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1624,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lI0grshjuYly7dhmV68lJc9aBtc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cDmGD49wDQ3ruKhnQkLkkrm2aHo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"trailer - the coast","key":"426531399","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-06T14:03:02.000Z","id":"61519325140bad008c92b3d6"}]}}}
