When an asset manager asked him to draw up a plan of a 16th-century building in the heart of Paris, he went into the flat of an enthusiastic collector of birds, nicknamed “The Bird Lady”. Her home was an exotic enchantment of birds either flying around freely or in refined cages. The more Daniel explored it, the less he felt that he was in Paris.","popularity":0.1018,"poster_path":"/jRzOKMSKjoR9bsPDFZ9zDPDP7bD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bird Lady","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Nadaud","original_name":"Daniel Nadaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5facbb8be48860004125b8be","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853238,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Fabrice Gaston","original_name":"Fabrice Gaston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbbc6b7a154003ff26830","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693844,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nicolas Lossec","original_name":"Nicolas Lossec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbcd9d363e50041644f92","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853248,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Benjamin Frydman","original_name":"Benjamin Frydman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbbf1de11e50041165888","department":"Art","job":"Art Department Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853258,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Burgnicourt Clemence","original_name":"Burgnicourt Clemence","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbc9043cd54003d937146","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1346100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hayoun Kwon","original_name":"Hayoun Kwon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/kIP0r5C35WNA4lFuB8jz7JSpzmP.jpg","credit_id":"5facbbaadfaae9003e649d7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853252,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Arthur Buordot","original_name":"Arthur Buordot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbc38d14443003fd1ea78","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853272,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norman Bambi","original_name":"Norman Bambi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbd4cdfaae9004164a674","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1885187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Desprats","original_name":"Pierre Desprats","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbca75aadc40040ae8995","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853234,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Guillaume Bertinet","original_name":"Guillaume Bertinet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbc02238513003df75ef7","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2853262,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Clement Monna","original_name":"Clement Monna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5facbcbade11e50040165de0","department":"Art","job":"Concept Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jRzOKMSKjoR9bsPDFZ9zDPDP7bD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
