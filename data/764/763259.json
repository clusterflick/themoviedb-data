Preliminary results from tests performed on the largest mummy's anomalous hands, cross-examined against the rest of the body, revealed no evidence to indicate a hoax. Scientists found the largest mummy, Maria, to be female and carbon dated her at roughly 1,700 years old. The tedious work of placing the mummies' DNA in our fossil record, comparing it to modern and ancient humans has begun.","popularity":0.0906,"poster_path":"/isOHePTE184FALBzNNdVQpHoB8D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unearthing Nazca: The Complete Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Unearthing Nazca: The Complete Story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403714,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Gaia","original_name":"Gaia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e2528be21023005f2dd09c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12737142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oTMWrRNKihCwvtmOqxOiU4oZUP1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/isOHePTE184FALBzNNdVQpHoB8D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
