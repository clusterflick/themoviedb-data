This dance film is the abstract expression searching and finding the \"oceanic feeling\", a term from Carl Jung to describe those moments when we experience an intense connectedness with the universe (e.g. artistic inspiration). The film was shot on Super-8 and 16 mm, and entirely optically printed (re-filmed frame by frame) to create all the movements and special effects.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/d66TIf1IDyCujfSmnWFquh7ABFc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hydromancy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerda Cammaer","original_name":"Gerda Cammaer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fadffabb686b9003e86f1f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/blWhtppf9RZPQ3RVZNSvZUJYuFS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1649,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d66TIf1IDyCujfSmnWFquh7ABFc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
