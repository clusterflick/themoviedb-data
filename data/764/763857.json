In the prevailing chaos, it is rather hard to keep direction. Caught in that hastle and bustle, you end asking yourself what to fill the day with, so that at night before sleep you could feel not a fleeting and fictitious, but solidly stable meaning, so that you could fall asleep with a feeling of calmness that you have lived a day being useful, and not only for yourself.
