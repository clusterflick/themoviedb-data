A character that leaves no traces or maps to trace. The file does not give an account of him. His works had no scripts and only existed in the fugacity of the moment. Jorge Bonino was an unclassifiable artist. He triumphed in all of Europe without a translator, he only used an invented language that everyone understood. An imaginary friend mapped the traces his body left in space through stories about a possible life.","popularity":0.3277,"poster_path":"/eLaMTPkzG1Tney1gvwoTw1OSYWg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66235,"logo_path":"/kgQt1K5adk8DksCvJ4SdcYdoonv.png","name":"Twins Latin
