From Japan to Germany, a young public fell for the off beat story of three boys and their first romantic encounters with few realizing that they were watching a new and profoundly different narrative from Israel. LEMON POPSICLE brought the producers (the notorious Golan and Globus cousins with their company Cannon Films) and the director to Hollywood. But the film, coined by the rather explicit sexism of the time, also left a number of the actors feeling traumatized over time as they performed in a series of internationally successful but increasingly mediocre sequels over the span of ten years. The documentary captures the grind of a never ending film production and the heady exhilaration of youth in a young country.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lemon Popsicle - of Winners and Losers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Friedler","original_name":"Eric Friedler","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/shl3ntXEARbApEyc79Y33TQHp0F.jpg","credit_id":"6375493549756000830ff868","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9352660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
