Chosen to represent this subject, Diomar is a multifaceted character, who has always documented the island of São Miguel through his Youtube channel. The camera he wields is like a weapon against time to protect his memories, because after all \"to remember is to live again\".","popularity":0.1379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diomar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diomar Almeida","original_name":"Diomar Almeida","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63765b8711c06600abe29614","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Lopes","original_name":"Ana Lopes","popularity":0.8317,"profile_path":"/eUoo8K1PT5H0BPx7HDqzfWglQnK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fernanda","credit_id":"63765b9d1cc4ff007d9246c2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thaylane Cristina","original_name":"Thaylane Cristina","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63765c9a156cc70082177ad6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790619,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maria Novo","original_name":"Maria Novo","popularity":0.0451,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63765ca95b2f47007fd5aa08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Novo","original_name":"Maria Novo","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63765cf22faf4d0082ff1f79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13598760","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
