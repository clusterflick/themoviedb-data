The demand for increased use of public transport instead of cars is obvious. Beeing â€“ the nature inspired VR journey is intended to raise awareness of these topics and at the same time create an example for added value for public transportation. Additionally, a prototype for a new content platform is being elaborated, which will also enable future-oriented developments by providing a variety of entertaining content between the train stations. The prototype presented is designed for short distance trains in the metropolitan area of Stuttgart, Germany with an approximate duration of three minutes. The physical conditions of the train ride are reflected in VR. With this special form of customer experience, the user is to be picked-up in the real world, i.e. in the real train, in order to experience a fantastic ride that far exceeds the experience of a normal train ride.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beeing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
