Four teenagers, (Chad Quarterback, Cherry Pop, Eddie Stone, and Mary Abstine) are celebrating one last camping trip together before they all go their separate ways to different colleges. The only catch being they decide to camp in the supposedly cursed forest known as \"Hades' Woods\".  Once they're all settled at their campsite, they decide to chant an ancient spell to summon the almighty demon lord, the slayer of saints, Hellfire Hades!  (Y'know, as all teenagers do!) To them, it's nothing more than an urban legend. But little do they know that Hellfire Hades is very real and will stop at nothing until all those that have disturbed his presence are completely and utterly destroyed. Can they survive?","popularity":0.2296,"poster_path":"/tci0lXJmv1yU7LpZUkERwMpyEyA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's
