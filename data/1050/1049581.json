As they continue to move in, Jess begins to notice odd disturbances regarding a family photo that came with the house. This culminates in the revelation that a pair of ghosts, ROBERT and MARGE occupy the residence. Though the ghosts clearly dislike the new occupants, Jess and Zach take this as a good omen. Jess and Zach beg the ghosts to help haunt their haunted house to which Robert and Marge take even more offense, and refuse the offer. Through trial and error, the humans attempt to scare the ghosts into helping them, though nothing works. At her breaking point, Jess destroys the ghost's picture frame, leading them into a fit of rage in which they resort to their supernatural powers. Impressed by their abilities, the humans flatter the ghosts into working with them, and the haunted house is a success.","popularity":0.412,"poster_path":"/nKQXNwjFMl8WIDC3kXlckwvDVYD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chapman University Dodge College of Film and Media
