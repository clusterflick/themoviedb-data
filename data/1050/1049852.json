Luna (Beatriz Campos), 21, lives an aesthetically pleasing life and is on a journey to find herself. However, her mind wanders all the time not knowing what to feel: \"Why does everyone think I'm alone?\". The objective of this short film is to demystify the association between the terms alone and solitary. Luna's thoughts and emotions will be ours to interpret on a poetic journey around her mind. Through aesthetically pleasing images and sounds, followed by the voice of her thoughts, Seoul, avec moi, provokes deep thought and helps us to look at the idea that we can be alone without being lonely.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seul, Avec Moi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipa Silva","original_name":"Filipa Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63769a73fab3fa00b4d0469f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YMOTION - Festival de Cinema Jovem de Famalic√£o","release_date":"2022-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
