Filmmakers Thomas Tode and Ale Mu√±oz approach Vertov from the present in their documentary portrait of this revolutionary Soviet filmmaker. They travelled by train to Moscow, not only because Vertov loved trains, but also so that they could mix his train shots with their own. And, of course, so they could tell the legendary story of the agit-prop trains, the mobile cinemas with which Bolshevik filmmakers travelled the Soviet Union in the 1920s to bring their political ideals to the people.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Land der Kinoveteranen: Filmexpedition zu Dziga Vertov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3791233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Tode","original_name":"Thomas Tode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6376b9cd156cc7007630c881","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
