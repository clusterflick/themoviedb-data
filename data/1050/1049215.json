Trombones from Havana","overview":"In the 60th year of the revolution, four young Cubans search for traces of history: Daniel, whose grandfather Faustino Pérez became the first minister for nationalization of property after the revolution, still has a catalog from an auction where confiscated berets and seaside villas were sold. Software programmer Christian traces his grandfather’s path to the Angolan civil war, and Milagro, a history student, tries to understand why the revolution that enabled her to study barely allows her to earn a living when she becomes a professor. Diana is a musician whose grandfather was once one of the founding members of the Orquesta Maravillas de Florida.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Granma.
