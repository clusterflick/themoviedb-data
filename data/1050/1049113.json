After Snow White was awakened by the prince's kiss ... the pair became Barbie and Ken ... Barbie wants to be the perfect lover for Ken, but there is alcoholism and anger and the consequent violation of their actual love. Based on a text called Alcoholism: The Merry-Go-Round of Denial, Barbie struggles throughout to retain her innocence. Consequently, the style of the video is handmade and childlike. The songs in the video, by Willie Nelson and Julie London (which I lip-sync), become the interior dialogue between Barbie and Ken.\" â€” Ellen Cantor","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xlb2EP4ctfUZfA0AdK0PGNcJDeU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barbie London: Trouble in Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1908222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Cantor","original_name":"Ellen Cantor","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dQ2zwlpDDmqrfKTyZABdUPgXa3A.jpg","credit_id":"63746d3183ee6700a37c0ebe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3788183,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Wolfgang Obermair","original_name":"Wolfgang Obermair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63746d4e83ee6700cd95dd24","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1908222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Cantor","original_name":"Ellen Cantor","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dQ2zwlpDDmqrfKTyZABdUPgXa3A.jpg","credit_id":"63746d59229ae2007619c70a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlb2EP4ctfUZfA0AdK0PGNcJDeU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Release date approximate.","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
