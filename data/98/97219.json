In CAN -- The Documentary,  the remaining band members are interviewed amidst culled together archival footage from talk shows, concerts, and television appearances to paint a portrait of a band who always remained happily on the sidelines of mass appeal, mixing street music, jazz, folk, and rock into a sometimes poppy, sometimes abstract stew. The band's influence on such seminal acts as Sonic Youth and Talking Heads is also analyzed.","popularity":0.3137,"poster_path":"/lrRL1YVTGbRRxs16rF5aVtX6Ijt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20005,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoRo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CAN: The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1919032,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Holger Czukay","original_name":"Holger Czukay","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019e969251415750019560","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1919129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaki Liebezeit","original_name":"Jaki Liebezeit","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019eba92514157450194da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Karoli","original_name":"Michael Karoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019ecbc3a36806f6018d97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Mooney","original_name":"Malcolm Mooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019eda92514157180198ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392505,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kris Needs","original_name":"Kris Needs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019ee9c3a368073301816b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Karoli","original_name":"Shirley Karoli","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019ef8925141572e018efc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43487,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Irmin Schmidt","original_name":"Irmin Schmidt","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a019f07c3a36807c5018d38","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudi Dolezal","original_name":"Rudi Dolezal","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/3YMCEzB5VjWKPWSQkcii2qq8GND.jpg","credit_id":"5a019f26c3a36807b30173c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":547263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannes Rossacher","original_name":"Hannes Rossacher","popularity":0.3448,"profile_path":"/dt3tRQengwFLunDxFploUHUsu3u.jpg","credit_id":"5a019f38925141572e018f75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Offen","original_name":"Sven Offen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a019f4e925141573a01a05d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2671330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lrRL1YVTGbRRxs16rF5aVtX6Ijt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215265,"name":"krautrock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
