The manufactured food business is bigger than Big Oil; that kind of money buys inconceivably large amounts of propaganda, misinformation and corrupted science. Processed People is a wake-up call with factual, hard-hitting health commentary that is rarely heard. If you're searching for the un-processed truth about diet and health, look no further.","popularity":0.08,"poster_path":"/m5KRF9yr4DwmS6lVldFMp4Tq7Pz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Antidote to America's Toxic Lifestyle","title":"Processed People","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1362467","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m5KRF9yr4DwmS6lVldFMp4Tq7Pz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Processed People - The Documentary (Trailer)","key":"VQNNX2Oo7Kk","published_at":"2008-12-02T20:36:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6dac3a368544800810f"}]}}}
