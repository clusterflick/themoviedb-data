His serene existence is thrown into a state of confusion when insomnia creeps in, and pianos that previously repaired miraculously overnight remain unfixed. Jacobo plunges into paranoia and madness, hearing noises during the night and having ephemeral visions of a stranger roaming the house in a dressing gown. Helena reassuringly denies anything out of the ordinary, and suspiciously insists he is hallucinating. Is the life we think safe and secure true, or is there a second reality lurking? THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE IS NOT BEING DEAD is a tale of betrayal and forgiveness in a rich musical universe, set against the Franco era, a period of political deceit and distorted reality in Spain. Playfully, the tragicomedy questions our perception of reality and the vulnerability of our human condition.","popularity":0.152,"poster_path":"/gefSeTTjmvyIn5aEsmAMCJBU4bs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Most Important Thing in Life is Not Being Dead","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Gutiérrez Caba","original_name":"Emilio Gutiérrez Caba","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/gCPju1eDQQOWFroZ3gI2ZVKhu1.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Jacobo 80","credit_id":"52fe49d99251416c750d54a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1013013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercè Montalà","original_name":"Mercè Montalà","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/5EOZvbsUofBu3rJqV5mhLvUlspi.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Helena 80","credit_id":"52fe49d99251416c750d54a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carles Arquimbau","original_name":"Carles Arquimbau","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/xovciuBefUYluVURdvP8hzP2tLV.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Gerard 80","credit_id":"52fe49d99251416c750d54a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marián Aguilera","original_name":"Marián Aguilera","popularity":0.1654,"profile_path":"/cZY5UeZsA9qmlKyIgdCwqGup1kJ.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Helena 50","credit_id":"5567278f925141478d001ae5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordi Domènech","original_name":"Jordi Domènech","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Vecino 50","credit_id":"556727a9c3a368174b001995","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Tort","original_name":"Xavier Tort","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Vecino 80","credit_id":"556727c59251414789001b22","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1499938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Ausellé","original_name":"Albert Ausellé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/md0KSNQ3b2IDErD1oZWsSzgqxrl.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Gerard 50","credit_id":"5e8cd759bdc34c00175ae949","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525742,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jordi J.
