Their Sgt Major is not happy about this and orders them to take the balloon down, but a freak heavy wind accidentally carries the gang away to Nazi Germany. They are captured and placed in a detention camp where they meet an elderly prisoner named Jerry, who possess a map  for the location of a secret weapon which will win the war! Fortunately Teddy Knox's impersonation of Hitler lands him the spot of pretending to be the Fuhrer at a gala dinner and the gang are allowed out of the camp. However the Nazis have other ideas for their substitute leader.","popularity":0.8546,"poster_path":"/2ZYT7hb5fqWLTColPQ1WHObe5to.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gainsborough Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1941-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gasbags","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Flanagan","original_name":"Bud Flanagan","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bud","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chesney Allen","original_name":"Chesney Allen","popularity":0.1024,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ches","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Nervo","original_name":"Jimmy Nervo","popularity":0.0572,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cecil","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1014901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Knox","original_name":"Teddy Knox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Teddy","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1014903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Naughton","original_name":"Charlie Naughton","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1014904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Gold","original_name":"Jimmy Gold","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e61","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moore Marriott","original_name":"Moore Marriott","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/cZbIuKVbBKjsRQyFdHZ2dl7DsJF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e65","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wally Patch","original_name":"Wally Patch","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/uOmiC8x6gwaGBOa40h0c1zY8c7J.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sgt Major","credit_id":"52fe49ed9251416c750d7e69","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gawthorne","original_name":"Peter Gawthorne","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":"/zkjV8jHknxSCVOVXinXGaLnnffb.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Commanding Officer","credit_id":"58f61450925141279500cde0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Valk","original_name":"Frederick Valk","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/xNXG072yil6UEVZVsOd4PuBNIcd.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Sturmfuehrer","credit_id":"58f61460c3a3680e8a00c7c5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Clavering","original_name":"Eric Clavering","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Sturmfuehrer","credit_id":"58f6146ec3a3680e4200b76b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Eustrel","original_name":"Anthony Eustrel","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/vU5HAvkUN5ZnzpQQtgFcZqxi06p.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Gestapo Officer","credit_id":"58f61485c3a3680e5000cc15","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Jaffe","original_name":"Carl Jaffe","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/nVhuF3FK6Ett5qrNTFnGkeVgA7S.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Gestapo Chief","credit_id":"58f61497c3a3680e6e00b8e2","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manning Whiley","original_name":"Manning Whiley","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/sv2COhmOPMv4JBryx9QsSGTDFK1.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"O.P.
