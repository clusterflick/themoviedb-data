Director Barbet Schroeder (Barfly) interviews Bukowski about such themes as alcohol, violence, and women, and Bukowski answers willingly, losing himself in sometimes minute-long monologues. Amongst other things, Bukowski leads the small camera team through his parents’ house and his former neighbourhood, but the largest part of the interviews takes place in Bukowski’s flat or backyard. The documentary includes a scene in which Bukowski reacts violently toward his wife Linda Lee.","popularity":0.3132,"poster_path":"/b1X3dJqpDbA0NB0L4cv4v5Jw9Wu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223,"logo_path":"/pdthRbCuXNlrGNwnmLFRxv5Zy3t.png","name":"Les Films du Losange","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Barbet Schroeder interviews Bukowski.","title":"The Charles Bukowski Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Bukowski","original_name":"Charles Bukowski","popularity":0.2255,"profile_path":"/jHKXGjR60oYp5k0hNiU10VNQg6P.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c44b5a4c3a36868bdf403aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbet Schroeder","original_name":"Barbet Schroeder","popularity":0.5297,"profile_path":"/rwhqq7bmhwc7Wjq0j2KbEZOIJOz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c44b5b30e0a266c66e6b264","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbet Schroeder","original_name":"Barbet Schroeder","popularity":0.5297,"profile_path":"/rwhqq7bmhwc7Wjq0j2KbEZOIJOz.jpg","credit_id":"55f3f9bfc3a3680a0d002d25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6100,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret Ménégoz","original_name":"Margaret Ménégoz","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/5pWXEemFnZ8L4ZlZ40nrsAoqwvV.jpg","credit_id":"59cb39cdc3a368777b00947e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbet Schroeder","original_name":"Barbet Schroeder","popularity":0.5297,"profile_path":"/rwhqq7bmhwc7Wjq0j2KbEZOIJOz.jpg","credit_id":"59cb39d59251412bcd009cce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbet Schroeder","original_name":"Barbet Schroeder","popularity":0.5297,"profile_path":"/rwhqq7bmhwc7Wjq0j2KbEZOIJOz.jpg","credit_id":"59cb39ea9251412bed009d4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895438,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Challicombe","original_name":"Paul Challicombe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59cb39e39251412bb3009bbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Louis Valéro","original_name":"Jean-Louis Valéro","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59cb39ddc3a368774e008bf1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1019894","wikidata_id":"Q1211865","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lNlcEdAKWs0rbI25WkPadIEetk3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xOUTdqwPetvpokJL3S3DBguTiYE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b1X3dJqpDbA0NB0L4cv4v5Jw9Wu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mqdTQLgXGrZhAByxip85AjxpweT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
