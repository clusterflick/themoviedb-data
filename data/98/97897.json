It was shot under Dylan's direction by D. A. Pennebaker, whose groundbreaking documentary Dont Look Back chronicled Dylan's 1965 British tour. The film was originally commissioned for the ABC television series Stage '66. Though shooting had completed for the film, Dylan's July 1966 motorcycle accident delayed the editing process. Once well enough to work again, Dylan edited the film himself. ABC rejected the film as incomprehensible for a mainstream audience.","popularity":1.3027,"poster_path":"/pNdQUmohdwki1qW2Ha1ryMn0itz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bob Dylan in '66","title":"Eat the Document","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Dylan","original_name":"Bob Dylan","popularity":0.6247,"profile_path":"/pMGkRge9jE0TRgENbUYt3N5qDPl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d907f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d9083","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robbie Robertson","original_name":"Robbie Robertson","popularity":0.4357,"profile_path":"/82bnxofH57Y0IcvjDVCDbUrBTqA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d9087","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Manuel","original_name":"Richard Manuel","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/nn3bt0ZlxuZDwJioTY3IZLL7rlT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d908b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Danko","original_name":"Rick Danko","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/rtbErZXhedEFXFfqZrIJcNqhGLE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d908f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garth Hudson","original_name":"Garth Hudson","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":"/nUfj7MKyylQXlY7zLGPFXhHK8gt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d9093","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Cash","original_name":"Johnny Cash","popularity":0.6074,"profile_path":"/8vIbqfss0GYh0ZgnfwE1ynzea6c.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c592b6b92514135b0533784","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Albert Grossman","original_name":"Albert Grossman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/snyDwkGYaUUMbvbHrmVmuIU94gJ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c592b7c9251415e346b75a0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Neuwirth","original_name":"Bob Neuwirth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/hg91gp5RasSWXeNliz8qkCoTvYf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c592b93c3a36872908c52bf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Jones","original_name":"Mickey Jones","popularity":0.3543,"profile_path":"/tdCfPWmgFwQtrZZv7cIBWKKxH8.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c592b9c92514151a967d7b2","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Dylan","original_name":"Bob Dylan","popularity":0.6247,"profile_path":"/pMGkRge9jE0TRgENbUYt3N5qDPl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f59251416c750d9099","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Dylan","original_name":"Bob Dylan","popularity":0.6247,"profile_path":"/pMGkRge9jE0TRgENbUYt3N5qDPl.jpg","credit_id":"59f435c89251414d2000a6cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927798,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Alk","original_name":"Howard Alk","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f435d69251414d6200b515","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927798,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Alk","original_name":"Howard Alk","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f435bf9251414d4d00b2d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927798,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Alk","original_name":"Howard Alk","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f435c39251414d0500b879","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
