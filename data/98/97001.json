He plays an ex-child star who now jerks sodas for a living in Hollywood. He gets back into the movie business when he overhears a conversation between producers discussing their newest prodigy. Cooper butts in and suggests the producers remake Skippy (a real-life 1931 film that made young Cooper a star). The bigwigs like the idea and then hire Cooper to become the boy's acting coach. Once back on the backlot, Cooper finds both trouble and romance while helping the young boy adjust to life as a movie star.","popularity":1.4809,"poster_path":"/zia70E5jbXuu5PQQ03W6lXnEA5r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"JUMPIN' JACKIE AND SWEET SUSANNA!","title":"Glamour Boy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Cooper","original_name":"Jackie Cooper","popularity":0.669,"profile_path":"/pbdUaMBfLq2qUP1jg7dM9hINRcI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tiny Barlow","credit_id":"52fe49cb9251416c750d37af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Foster","original_name":"Susanna Foster","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/aQPSpqHzN7k0mc6Ce0KbR4tj6bM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joan Winslow","credit_id":"52fe49cb9251416c750d37b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Abel","original_name":"Walter Abel","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/fmRDR3Rtz6mmbAKuhsQHjFi4cRN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anthony J.
