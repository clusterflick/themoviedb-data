Ronson finds that most contain materials reflecting work Kubrick did after the release of \"Barry Lyndon\" in 1975, when Kubrick's film output slowed down. Ronson finds audition tapes for \"Full Metal Jacket,\" photographs to find the right hat for \"Clockwork Orange\" or the right doorway for \"Eyes Wide Shut\" -- thousands of details that went into Kubrick's meticulous approach. Ronson believes that the boxes show \"the rhythm of genius.\" Interviews with family, staff, and friends are included.","popularity":0.2549,"poster_path":"/svi87pIHWohYQrI0yowbdLhPcSp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1421,"logo_path":"/uWCPDzKkQnOxQ5spgKpD8wzSIP1.png","name":"World of Wonder","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stanley Kubrick's Boxes","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":34,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Ronson","original_name":"Jon Ronson","popularity":0.2225,"profile_path":"/vP51bN1BVFm6MaciZYyRYSFejee.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b03199251415ec50050e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508489,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Frewin","original_name":"Anthony Frewin","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b032792514173fc0098b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5016,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jan Harlan","original_name":"Jan Harlan","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/71s8NkRpUyzwyBTRsipLr8RBqlA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b032fc3a36833b6005326","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Kubrick","original_name":"Christiane Kubrick","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/vAMX00LJH0B38o5mCNCKn6DDdEI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b03389251417383004c05","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238089,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Manuel Harlan","original_name":"Manuel Harlan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b03419251415ec50050ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1547782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anya Kubrick","original_name":"Anya Kubrick","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b034a92514169e2005433","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Vitali","original_name":"Leon Vitali","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/6YHGAjJI0ra7F74UUZeSf5Qtcdd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"566b035d92514169e2005439","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220980,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vincent Tilsley","original_name":"Vincent Tilsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ccc64d4c3a36836abdb7ede","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Ronson","original_name":"Jon Ronson","popularity":0.2225,"profile_path":"/vP51bN1BVFm6MaciZYyRYSFejee.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49de9251416c750d6017","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Ronson","original_name":"Jon Ronson","popularity":0.2225,"profile_path":"/vP51bN1BVFm6MaciZYyRYSFejee.jpg","credit_id":"566b0379c3a36836b4008ef0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343605,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kieran Smyth","original_name":"Kieran Smyth","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566b0387c3a3682647004c8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Fisher-Turner","original_name":"Simon Fisher-Turner","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67781428321a3a166a74a2fb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1263704","wikidata_id":"Q7599731","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sTFCld3IiB9V5apfY8tiD3UavJO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/svi87pIHWohYQrI0yowbdLhPcSp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stanley Kubrick's Boxes trailer","key":"htQq3oYO5sI","published_at":"2010-11-24T07:27:14.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"566b03de92514125d3000248"}]}}}
