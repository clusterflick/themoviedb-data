Trouble is, the orphans, dressed as Indians, want to shoot arrows and tomahawk-chop everything in sight, and especially Tom, who quickly gets scalped and has the end of his tail chopped off. He captures Jerry; this, of course, means war, for which the tots paint dozens of badminton shuttlecocks as a fake army. They also paint a fierce face on the sleeping dog. Ultimately, they get Tom to leave a trail of gunpowder, which they light, destroying the garage. Tom signals a truce, and they all smoke a peace pipe, but the smoke comes out of Tom's ears instead of his mouth.","popularity":0.6318,"poster_path":"/jO2fwReWw9eTUdl7iESrPvLfpiM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Little Indians","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":36,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tom & Jerry: Två små indianer","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":0.7365,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d936d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Barbera","original_name":"Joseph Barbera","popularity":1.2363,"profile_path":"/16UhnbVLaX9QBtcnjLH6hrdzq4F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d9379","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Bradley","original_name":"Scott Bradley","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/AjQ95xfBtFc39ADKaPi1jupim2m.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d9385","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Patterson","original_name":"Ray Patterson","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":"/przzcKQJDVMVhX9ovm7bnvSNkbf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d938b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149098,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Muse","original_name":"Kenneth Muse","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d9391","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149100,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Irven Spence","original_name":"Irven Spence","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d9397","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149095,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Barge","original_name":"Ed Barge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d939d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149097,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Gentle","original_name":"Robert Gentle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d93a3","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Quimby","original_name":"Fred Quimby","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f79251416c750d93a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0046473","wikidata_id":"Q7859058","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84o1VNGM9DVAXoujaXgSvxGzj4q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1668,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jO2fwReWw9eTUdl7iESrPvLfpiM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1112},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/szHMXK8GIcS0WaPNzIcB9TFk9YD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
