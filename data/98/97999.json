In this documentary we can sadly see how the entire German judicial system protected with its laws and glosses of these many who committed criminal acts during the period of national socialism where the Holocaust took place, in which 6 million Jews were exterminated. Very probably Bauer's death was a murder that went unpunished by this same corrupted judicial system.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tod auf Raten","title":"Fritz Bauer: Tod auf Raten","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilona Ziok","original_name":"Ilona Ziok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d65345c3a368437900023f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1679579","wikidata_id":"Q24255212","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
