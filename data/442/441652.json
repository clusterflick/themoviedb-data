Bob White, labour leader of the Canadian branch of the UAW, must also confront his American counterpart from Detroit and succeeds in arriving at a contract that is significantly Canadian. His members had already given him a mandate to fight for independence from the American union. This is an invaluable document for anyone interested in the complexities of United States-Canada relations. It's an extraordinary film about revolutionary events.","popularity":0.5871,"poster_path":"/9gUNayJ687maJvpewZqlFCZIpox.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bob White and the Canadian Auto Workers Fight for Independence.","title":"Final Offer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"La derni√®re offre","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Final Offer: Bob White and the Canadian Auto Workers Fight for Independence","type":"complete title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1015794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Ramer","original_name":"Henry Ramer","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/6IAUTatDbPJUze3UqBDgf3tMLEC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5eb39e060cb3350021c7956a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger B.
