A drought-stricken family maintains a long and desperate vigil for a cloud of dust on the horizon signalling the arrival of irrigation pipes and pump. They are rewarded with a military convoy instead. Its top priority is a border war with a neighboring state, not pipes for the life-saving water the family must have.","popularity":0.2236,"poster_path":"/tPjbkskUFxybNQ6US66WlB3N9JU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Top Priority","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ishu Patel","original_name":"Ishu Patel","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/xGdkFK12QYqmdKeTzJJSZZsFvI2.jpg","credit_id":"58a24a93925141538300027e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0209426","wikidata_id":"Q123289079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPjbkskUFxybNQ6US66WlB3N9JU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2225,"name":"third world"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
