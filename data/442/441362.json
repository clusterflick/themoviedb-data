Over a six month period, director Dani√®le Wilmouth collaborated with the Butoh dancer Katsura Kan, and his dance company The Saltimbanques, to create movements for both dancers and camera. The result is an exploration of intimate relationships and bi-cultural identity. The British musician Adrian Freedman composed the original score for the film.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/a5ZDumTZPy3nOMCbhpizKXKXzHp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curtain of Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4286322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsura Kan","original_name":"Katsura Kan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"650e9c0c26dac100ac07e92c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Wilmouth","original_name":"Daniele Wilmouth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a0ae6dc3a3684dc000130e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2694,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a5ZDumTZPy3nOMCbhpizKXKXzHp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1796}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
