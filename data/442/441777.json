The film begins in England with children seeking shelter as anti-aircraft guns roar outside. On their arrival in Canada, they are thrilled by the brightly lit cities, powerful Canadian trains, hot dogs and ice cream. They find, too, that instead of becoming Mounties or cowboys, they have to go to school. The closing sequence shows them learning to ski and skate and preparing for Christmas in their new homes.","popularity":0.2549,"poster_path":"/uMxvN4UnOuBmDO2cr9CkQ7p14En.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1940-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children from Overseas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorne Greene","original_name":"Lorne Greene","popularity":0.768,"profile_path":"/8thOy0TS7tNDBcwPqjmOPw9Jgdx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58a3ba6d92514157a9001921","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stanley Hawes","original_name":"Stanley Hawes","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/1Eo0X3Pp7szHewOPWgCUPAjdKjN.jpg","credit_id":"58a3ba8292514157a50019c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6530946","wikidata_id":"Q23638547","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uMxvN4UnOuBmDO2cr9CkQ7p14En.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1940-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
