Questioning the privatized existence of a woman and child, and the role of media information in daily life, this non-narrative tape is structured around the sounds of a woman feeding her small son and readying him for bed, while a radio interview with an art dealer plays in the background. Photographs of family life and corporate ads are juxtaposed with a written text that crawls across the screen, comparing life in Chile with life in the United States. Rosler refers to this layered juxtaposition of fragmented sound, images and text as an \"artist-mother's This Is Your Life.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domination and the Everyday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Rosler","original_name":"Martha Rosler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2t6W0F7XUl3bjxx5aQBeMu34N7e.jpg","credit_id":"58a203b8c3a368791f000896","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
