What is striking is the cordiality and good cooperation within the women's group, despite their monotonous work in the control area in the production of tungsten wires, also called filaments. Original tones are inserted to convey the joys, the cheerfulness and quick-wittedness that they have despite their burden of family and work. A problem of the wrong way of counting the female workers is openly addressed by the brigade leader and in a countercut Inge introduces her baby to her colleagues in the company. Everything seems like one big family and nobody can really imagine being without this work.","popularity":0.1327,"poster_path":"/3K1Y3dFu4recK92bCJshT4EKRIH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1963-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stars","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"58a060e7c3a36802fd006992","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621513,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Lehmann","original_name":"Christian Lehmann","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590985fdc3a368359d00a29c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"590985ec9251411cf6009bcd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417163","wikidata_id":"Q28790920","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3K1Y3dFu4recK92bCJshT4EKRIH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
