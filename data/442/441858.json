Inspiration for the film is taken from the HBO mini-series “Band of Brothers”, and from the New York Times best-selling novel by Steven Ambrose, where a black nurse “Anna” shows up very briefly raising a number of unsolved questions. Who was this person? Why did she appear and then vanish from the pages of history? Is she a myth?  The answers may surprise you.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Forgotten Angel of Bastogne","title":"Searching for Augusta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
