From the flash of blades, the spurting ice, and the echoing roar of avid fans, the film occasionally turns back to neighbourhood games where youngsters learn skating and stickhandling, the fundamentals of professional skill. Stars, such as Clint Smith, Bob Davidson, Syl Apps and others, are seen in action.","popularity":0.3529,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1940-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irving Jacoby","original_name":"Irving Jacoby","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a162ab9251413c4000114f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1423943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irving Jacoby","original_name":"Irving Jacoby","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb393e866469a001de21e06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628367,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Godfrey Ridout","original_name":"Godfrey Ridout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb394140cb3350021c787ff","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628366,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Milton Shyman","original_name":"Milton Shyman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb393f8f3e0df001f2a08b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14482154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6483,"name":"ice hockey"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1940-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
