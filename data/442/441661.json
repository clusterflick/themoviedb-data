And yet, only about 40% of U.S. citizens know all the words. And even fewer know their meaning. Join us as we travel back to 1814, when Washington D.C. was under British attack during the \"Second War of Independence,\" and the very bricks and mortar of American democracy were reduced to smoking rubble. We examine the battle that inspired witness Francis Scott Key to immortalize its final moments, then reveal how his poem transformed into an anthem.","popularity":0.6337,"poster_path":"/2Ej2gyEl9oMSfcoBUGNFxcfy0kv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86528,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Biscuit Factory","origin_country":""},{"id":77172,"logo_path":"/h29wMyK1OWD572SUoufzWT0sIQr.png","name":"LionHeart FilmWorks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Star-Spangled Story: Battle for America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"星条旗的故事：美国独立战争","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Wilburn","original_name":"Jeff Wilburn","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tMHMeAw2vCrG1RNpPwOT59Zsr5W.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"58a259269251415392000b48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clent Bowers","original_name":"Clent Bowers","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - National Anthem Performer","credit_id":"58a25867925141538b000ae6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Purcell","original_name":"Catherine Purcell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Voice Student","credit_id":"58a25914925141537f000b03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1757331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer L.
