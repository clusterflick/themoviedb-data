For almost fifty years he and his band ‘Tangerine Dream’ explored sound and its effect on our emotions. This film about one of Germany’s first electronic bands kicks off with the young Berlin musicians who were as inspired by the space age of the 1960s, with its rocket launchings and visions of the future, as they were by their own heartbeat, on which Froese also based compositions. Aided by the Moog and other synthesisers Froese (and various band members) revolutionised popular music. His explorations took him into the worlds of classical, new and film music. He preferred to visualise moods rather than create clearly structured songs.  A blend of amateur footage, interviews with band members, relatives, friends and colleagues such as Jean-Michel Jarre that creates a comprehensive portrait of an artistic pioneer.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":"/eZUEeRq6sTcIdkpQcST4Wp9LBl6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":73710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eastgate Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revolution of Sound - Tangerine Dream","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Tangerine Dream - Revolution of Sound","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henning Brümmer","original_name":"Henning Brümmer","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c4748a7719d7008adb6411","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarete Kreuzer","original_name":"Margarete Kreuzer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a346f792514127c6001233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882445,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Volker Gehrke","original_name":"Volker Gehrke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae88f0925141077e0540dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1882446,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Klaus Sturm","original_name":"Klaus Sturm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae8934925141077e054112","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717077,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lukas Schmid","original_name":"Lukas Schmid","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae88fdc3a3682cc8053d60","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerd Haag","original_name":"Gerd Haag","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae88b5c3a3682cc8053d0b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1882444,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bianca Froese-Acquaye","original_name":"Bianca Froese-Acquaye","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/szhw2SKHmyLj5j7A9eqPHdhvZJh.jpg","credit_id":"59ae88c892514107af0535f8","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240238,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Krieg","original_name":"Kerstin Krieg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae88db9251410723051909","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaron Henrie-McCrea","original_name":"Jaron Henrie-McCrea","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ae8919c3a3682c0a0536c0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6708818","wikidata_id":"Q37850667","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2826,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/atOxNYZC1ABVbskdidI8NXD4flY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eZUEeRq6sTcIdkpQcST4Wp9LBl6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207379,"name":"electronic music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
