Tormented by the belief that they live in an incredibly noisy society, the award-winning couple of Israeli filmmakers resolves to investigate the issue: they install cameras in their house to capture sources of this formidable sonic mass that invades their daily lives.  Noise is a reviving acknowledgement of the Griersonian tradition of dramatic treatment and social exclamation for a civil change in the actual world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NOISE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Raash","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noit Geva","original_name":"Noit Geva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a3a88c925141579f000dc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Geva","original_name":"Dan Geva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a3a89c925141578e000d6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10233844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
