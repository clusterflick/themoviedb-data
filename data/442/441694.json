For the first time on television, they hear first-hand from those involved in the show when it opened on Broadway in September 1957, including Sondheim himself, producer Hal Prince and original cast members from both show and movie, including Chita Rivera Carol Lawrence and Rita Moreno. With the BBC Symphony Orchestra and specially cast singers, we re-live some of the wonderful music and, in the company of Suzy and Bruno, we discover how West Side Story placed the 1950s phenomena of racial tension and teenage gangs centre stage to create a hit that changed musical theatre forever.","popularity":1.3005,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Side Stories: The Making of a Classic","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Tonioli","original_name":"Bruno Tonioli","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/gkXm7W942ODlUJBbxJBgKxgNaqi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a3e73560e0a2620ef01275a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946981,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzy Klein","original_name":"Suzy Klein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a3e73779251411fd200d9a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Sondheim","original_name":"Stephen Sondheim","popularity":0.5287,"profile_path":"/vRMGsYYDIVpoyCIQ65wZ6femLly.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2ce93c3a3682954005236","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chita Rivera","original_name":"Chita Rivera","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":"/Aa8bnNOVmto6OsnQf4NtC2PohGN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2ce9c925141539b005098","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Moreno","original_name":"Rita Moreno","popularity":0.7988,"profile_path":"/zB0M77jr7tmsmWHEr2bWO2Xq66L.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2ceb1c3a368292a0050bf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":160298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Lawrence","original_name":"Carol Lawrence","popularity":0.3203,"profile_path":"/3uxk2N7u2eeB60zxhiBnW4oF1rW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2cebac3a36828e3004e55","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Prince","original_name":"Hal Prince","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/vYEeKBLIHa6lJ1ULCbarde4l9fg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2cf0bc3a36829020054c0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Robbins","original_name":"Jerome Robbins","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/c2bQHnpIxU7zivrcztqEmmWIMsK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2cf27925141539200529f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17665,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Laurents","original_name":"Arthur Laurents","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/fcZJfQSVA4Qlcbt90SG40CKOhBH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2cf35c3a36828e3004ea3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58a2cf43925141537f00546a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1850023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ursula Macfarlane","original_name":"Ursula Macfarlane","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5966614cc3a368253c10e07a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6144522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BBC - West Side Stories - The Making Of A Classic","key":"ZnVaBUNPKDI","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-31T17:54:15.000Z","id":"62d2db2453f83303ff2c20e4"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"West Side Story : The Making of a Classic BBC 2 - clip","key":"SmqpktteK4Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-12-22T04:48:53.000Z","id":"62d2db52d4653700508e8391"}]}}}
