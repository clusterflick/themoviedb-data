Toy buildings and photographic or painted images of city streets serve as backdrops. Festive elements from circuses, carnivals, and holiday parades are combined into an exuberant procession set to the music of John Philip Sousa. As the film ends, and the last puppet looks up at the sky, a red balloon drifts upward and the music fades out.  Edinburgh International Film Festival award winner, 1954.","popularity":0.113,"poster_path":"/rGQtQyMmxeKRSTAfTswYjaAp4VB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parade, or Here They Come Down Our Street","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Parade","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Eames","original_name":"Ray Eames","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/jILIR1qMthTLZ93meHnnzw0vLrg.jpg","credit_id":"58a40c0692514165bf000e79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Eames","original_name":"Charles Eames","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/nLh3r0QomqDHKdi1cjOwnUC8uJe.jpg","credit_id":"58a40c1292514165b9000e81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0294831","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rGQtQyMmxeKRSTAfTswYjaAp4VB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1599,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sgVY23AKMwwb23ixoYVdJ1rhvLQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
