Since mother's death they live with father and grandmother in the big city. When one day attractive Rose steps into father's life, Ruby and Garnet's whole life is turned upside down. They must leave their beloved granny and move to the countryside with father and that much hated \"new one\" because father wants to fulfill his most ardent dream to open a bookstore. The girls consider this to be quite terrible and try everything to be thrown out of the new school. But then everything goes quite different: Ruby discovers that identical twin girls are being looked for to star in a TV series. Suddenly, they notice that they are not as similar at all as they thought, and that each one must find her own way.","popularity":0.9611,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Act","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1253518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Warriner","original_name":"Paul Warriner","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"58a0ad249251412b6d0012b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Dowling","original_name":"Rachael Dowling","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qfTxlxyziyN7X7Ildjc4HUHlVTU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"58a0ad309251412b61001295","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloe Tempest Jones","original_name":"Chloe Tempest Jones","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Garnet","credit_id":"58a0ad3cc3a3684db900124f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Tempest-Jones","original_name":"Zoe Tempest-Jones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ruby Barker","credit_id":"58a0ad4cc3a3684dd600125b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":172191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Beach","original_name":"Ann Beach","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/r2nuD4Z93iHEckJj6JtTov9jXxa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gran","credit_id":"58a0ad5fc3a3684dd6001271","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Montague","original_name":"Bruce Montague","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/lJtWwkLPGojnqMBX0a4zwvvHlos.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"58a0ad6fc3a3684dd600127e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1243026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Wilson","original_name":"Jacqueline Wilson","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/mfWZ0GqhU4E1RHi4pAaPrr9cl2q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Casting director","credit_id":"58a0ad809251413d1b000ca8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Coleman","original_name":"Charlotte Coleman","popularity":0.3382,"profile_path":"/R5RxaKkveZrwRW2DatqIWr9pmH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Debenham","credit_id":"58a0ad8e9251412b610012cb","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cilla Ware","original_name":"Cilla Ware","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a0ae0ec3a3684dcd001551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1243026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Wilson","original_name":"Jacqueline Wilson","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/mfWZ0GqhU4E1RHi4pAaPrr9cl2q.jpg","credit_id":"58a0ae209251412b700014ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0377804","wikidata_id":"Q1659340","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":817,"name":"bookshop"},{"id":15016,"name":"twins"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
