An indigenous painter, an indigenous chief, a peasant, a violinist, a singer of rhymes and a former guerrilla fighter talk to us about the life of our Transparent Hero, as we delve into their worlds of daily struggle in a country that is proud of its economic growth and gradually seeks to eliminate the memory of its people. These are stories that are weaved to highlight the figure of Victoriano Lorenzo through the imagination that creates time in the self-image of Panamanians amidst memories, versions and contradictions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PA","name":"Panama"}],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transparent Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1758804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orgun Wagua","original_name":"Orgun Wagua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hP0TIFjrl7sJWtZMFa1WpjIPQm5.jpg","credit_id":"58a55709c3a3683d8500271a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
