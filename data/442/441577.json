The conversation turns toward the irony of self-starvation in a land of plenty and toward the international politics of food, where food aid is used as a negotiating tool. Confronting a serious issue, Rosler simultaneously sets into play the confessional form and the ghoulish staginess of talk show dramatics.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Losing: A Conversation with the Parents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Rosler","original_name":"Martha Rosler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2t6W0F7XUl3bjxx5aQBeMu34N7e.jpg","credit_id":"58a202dd925141453b0007e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
