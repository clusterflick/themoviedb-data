For instance, in his 2013 project “Main Hall,” he deconstructs the main exhibition hall of the Viennese Secession, filming the exhibition architecture with 19 individual cameras and thus creating images that show the view of the exhibition space onto itself.  Fleischmann’s recent work, “Untitled (Generali Foundation Vienna)\" identifies the film camera as a spacial object-form by itself. Correlating with the history of artistic interventions on site, the object is placed in the former exhibition space of the Generali Foundation at Wiedner Hauptstrasse 15, Vienna, and provided with a cinematographic view.","popularity":0.2125,"poster_path":"/mF1lSzjnQZ1nE2ZFzBDIfV9VOkb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (Generali Foundation Vienna)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Fleischmann","original_name":"Philipp Fleischmann","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a49c3392514165b6006e36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Fleischmann","original_name":"Philipp Fleischmann","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58a49c5692514165b0006b4a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mF1lSzjnQZ1nE2ZFzBDIfV9VOkb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158697,"name":"installation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
