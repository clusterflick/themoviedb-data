So Eve wins Lewis Dike, whom Cornelia loves. Immediately after her wedding Eve beings a series of dangerous adventures with Wilfred Meadows. Lewis learns of them and endeavors to reason with his wife, but she will not listen. As Cornelia is sailing for Europe, Lewis meets her at the dock, tells her that he made a mistake in marrying Eve and that they will be divorced--and that he loves Cornelia. They part with mutual assurances of a future meeting.
