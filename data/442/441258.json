In a rage, the actress knocks at Tricointe's door with a view to protesting against the treatment she is given. She goes about it so well that she ends up being accommodated by the president himself. This is the moment Jean-Pierre Gaudet, the Minister of Justice, chooses to pay an unannounced visit to his friend Tricointe. There he mistakes Vérotchka for Madame Tricointe and the president does not dare to contradict Gaudet. A lot of absurd situations ensue.","popularity":0.3135,"poster_path":"/nMXqBVbJnykRj1NikJ6k8smJkvL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Fernand
