Beginning as a city state commission under the name and attitude of “Unschool”, the film became a kaleidoscope of the experiences, questions and wonders of a couple of high school students after a year of experiences with filmmaker Ana Vaz questioning what cinema can be.

song.","popularity":0.1409,"poster_path":"/fCDtRf2S2wq1SDJqehBpoP2SIDs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184615,"logo_path":null,"name":"EGEAC - Galerias Municipais de
