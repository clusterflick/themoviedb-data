It was a discovery that solved an enduring maritime mystery that had baffled experts for over half a century. The Graf Zeppelin has finally been found! This film tells the incredible story of the lead ship of the German \"Kriegsmarine\", from its construction to its sinking and its amazing discovery over five decades later. The Graf Zeppelin was a war ship of massive proportions that was never used for its intended purpose and eventually fell into the hands of the Russians, who used it for target practice off the coast of Poland. The program features rare access to private Graf Zeppelin archives, state-of-the-art animation, dramatic reconstructions and a high-tech underwater shoot at the mysterious site of the sunken wreck.","popularity":0.8596,"poster_path":"/tNsYdd9MgPJJL7TfLLTXNwDxcJN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story behind Hitler’s showpiece aircraft carrier – The Graf Zeppelin.","title":"Finding the Graf Zeppelin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13275808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aG8K3jBCUaUeDcuHARZoE2vTn5A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tNsYdd9MgPJJL7TfLLTXNwDxcJN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1536},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/awTOtv90Qi2E3ES3VQsNyeO5n1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":221092,"name":"aircraft carrier"},{"id":233857,"name":"german navy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
