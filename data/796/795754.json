Earth, existence, and consciousness; all the design of a hyper intelligent race of aliens known as the Thesquardorians. On December the 31st, 1974, the Thesquardorians decided the simulation had run its course. This is an absurdist comedy set in a computer lab in the 1970s. Two computer technicians dredging through their graveyard shift on New Yearâ€™s Eve stumble upon the final digit of pi which sends their entire existence spiraling out of control as they come to terms with the fact that it was all a sophisticated computer simulation.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":"/xEwStaBPt0QwcaQSF3Isp5PNQxA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frances and Yuri Ring in the New Year","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Kang","original_name":"Madeleine Kang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Frances","credit_id":"62669771d8f44e12f00b3649","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1819694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hong","original_name":"Edward Hong","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/xJShA0btHLpgHvJxCInlnT9PlnZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yuri","credit_id":"62669782149565168212878a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692747,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artin Aroutounians","original_name":"Artin Aroutounians","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024ee6cf36a32003fb1dd8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xEwStaBPt0QwcaQSF3Isp5PNQxA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Earliest found posting","release_date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
