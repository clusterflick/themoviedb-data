Being identified as “female” in his passport means he cannot legally find work, either. Since even a visit to the doctor is a risk for him, he has begun hormone therapy to transition on his own with support from internet forums and the local transgender community. Desperate to escape their hopeless situation and leave the country, Alexander’s wife Mari decides to become a surrogate mother for 12,000 dollars. But their ostensibly pragmatic plan backfires when Alex and Mari gradually develop an emotional bond with the unborn child.","popularity":0.0716,"poster_path":"/dtETU98xbEM6loADSKnQsHVTAC2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fortisfemfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":22627,"logo_path":"/mZsZ3IYzoheUPTPN3WeFwOYxAkP.png","name":"Film- und Medienstiftung NRW","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":148439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Bosch Stiftung","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Instructions for Survival","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2279837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Ugrekhelidze","original_name":"Yana Ugrekhelidze","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cce30761421006c284da2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2279837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Ugrekhelidze","original_name":"Yana Ugrekhelidze","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cce355ed8e90054f16a2f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lennart Saathoff","original_name":"Lennart Saathoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cce3d46f3540069e590e4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1686631,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jule Katinka Cramer","original_name":"Jule Katinka Cramer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cce43924ce6006c79e0b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024923,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Agata Wozniak","original_name":"Agata Wozniak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cce49eea34d003dac1696","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2279837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Ugrekhelidze","original_name":"Yana Ugrekhelidze","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602555946a3448003d12eeaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14130986","wikidata_id":"Q107451717","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mULZZkcaGiKVGYv0iUcJqmygLZz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dtETU98xbEM6loADSKnQsHVTAC2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
