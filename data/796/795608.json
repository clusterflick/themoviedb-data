Enduring the scorn of random people, the elements, and coping with a terrible head injury, he finds hope in the unlikeliest of friends: a dog and a pastor (Greg Mason, \"Midnight (2020),\" \"Dispatched\"). Together, they explore kindness, compassion, and what it means to live--and to become a Godsend to others.","popularity":0.2751,"poster_path":"/bdTil9Rtj3RadfPvIxwAU2G59f3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Godsend","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2561584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ochotorena","original_name":"Michael Ochotorena","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/6wYpjMlFYyXcnhJo3tdbCxAjOJB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Doe","credit_id":"658f214b0e5aba745886224a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1736730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Mason","original_name":"Greg Mason","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pastor","credit_id":"658f218063536a5d14b86264","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2652024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Winn","original_name":"Kevin Winn","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Public Defender","credit_id":"658f21a01f748b6d83985933","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Patterson","original_name":"Kathy Patterson","popularity":0.0711,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Judge Patterson","credit_id":"658f21be7a4ee74a2383e41c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JoAnn F.
