If you walk into the cave, it looks like a screen, a rectangle showing clouds and white light, just like a film. Director Kim Minjung delves into the bloody history of Jeju, where tens of thousands were killed in a massacre in 1948. The camera follows the traces in the landscape, sometimes transformed by a strident, distance-creating red light, accompanied by a commentary by avant-garde filmmaker Hollis Frampton. Film as a means to address history and its taboos.","popularity":0.1652,"poster_path":"/lbQ2PFgOyprjexlaRe3wksaaRaU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Filter is Withdrawn.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"LE-DEU-PIL-TEO-GA CHEOL-HOE-DOEB-NI-DA","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1736829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Minjung","original_name":"김민정","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/b85twxHtXe7Vmf3jS2T72Wc9jUA.jpg","credit_id":"60257d42efd3c2003f625b3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gNcgwXiKjrsqHryh4U0CEpA4HnE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbQ2PFgOyprjexlaRe3wksaaRaU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254517,"name":"jeju uprising"},{"id":267986,"name":"jeju island"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experimental Film & Video Festival in Seoul","release_date":"2020-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
