Act I, based on Schnitzler's The Little Comedy, is a delightful romp through the sexual ennui of turn-of-the-century Vienna, as two wealthy but bored socialites masquerade as impoverished bohemians seeking romance. Act II, based on the Jules Renard play Summer Share, explores modern affection and disaffection as two married couples share a summer house in the Hamptons. An Off-Off-Broadway sensation that successfully moved to Broadway, Romance/Romance is a charming and tuneful small-cast gem, here filmed live for television.","popularity":0.5075,"poster_path":"/9pQaJyuMY9MjLDxhrOloQHxeXbE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106324,"logo_path":"/s3zNiYR6gmjGjI7fphaym7WuNLy.png","name":"A+E Global
