Marco Polo explores 5 cities for each of the 11 categories and this repetition is clearly visible when he builds the summary table of the different combinations. A fundamental book for understanding the depth of Italo Calvino. In 1998 the painter and set designer from Palermo  Manfredo Manfredi was freely inspired by the novelby Italo Calvino and a short film made with the rotoscoping and single-panel techniques. The result is a fluid and at the same time meaningful animation in the best Manfredian tradition.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Cities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfredo Manfredi","original_name":"Manfredo Manfredi","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":"/avOdgaTlxZNpOq3SEuPMfsi5eFU.jpg","credit_id":"60254e56efd3c2003f620b17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
