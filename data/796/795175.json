It takes as its starting point the current coronavirus pandemic and filters it through theorist Jill Casid’s writings on the necrocene, and Walter Benjamin's writings on identifying the difference between threshold and boundaries. Handelman's characters, who each have already struggled with existential questions of belonging and fear in her projects DORIAN, A CINEMATIC PERFUME (2009/11); IRMA VEP, THE LAST BREATH (2013/15); and HUSTLERS & EMPIRES (2018), are juxtaposed with found images and texts sourced during the pandemic to take on a new form that both denies and struggles with containment.","popularity":0.0883,"poster_path":"/1YTsaYBzuxIZgUFw7z15b9y6Yt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"These Unruly and Ungovernable Selves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2326702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Handelman","original_name":"Michelle Handelman","popularity":0.3811,"profile_path":"/2hmYmMWGeXMzaIZzYRn95bxpxfv.jpg","credit_id":"6022f4e09979d2003de43101","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1YTsaYBzuxIZgUFw7z15b9y6Yt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
