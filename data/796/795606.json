Bird and Diz are gone, but giants still walk among us. One of those giants is Buster Williams. Buster has played with everyone - Miles, Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson, Art Blakey, and on. In this intimate portrait, Buster trades stories, and plays, with some of the world's greatest musicians - Benny Golson, Herbie Hancock, Christian McBride and others, and takes us on a journey through his life, legacy, and America's greatest art form - the truly universal music called Jazz.","popularity":0.3472,"poster_path":"/bHP2xgDSPA4viAWlntfmUTpkaWm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buster Williams Bass to Infinity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Williams","original_name":"Buster Williams","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6024655e03f0b6003fe3c2cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133955,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benny Golson","original_name":"Benny Golson","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/utucknTXgzHMnpWK42XxGSdkW1p.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"602465966af8f800402c37ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbie Hancock","original_name":"Herbie Hancock","popularity":0.5101,"profile_path":"/xjXWB5vdaiU9wUiOAkQeRY0cwob.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"602465bbc5ada5003d7f9516","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Kahan","original_name":"Adam Kahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024663e764b9900401e4e5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Kahan","original_name":"Adam Kahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6024664def9d72003e57fa71","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13524992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pynsjBY0Wrueeo5KibWrhgvAidn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1552}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHP2xgDSPA4viAWlntfmUTpkaWm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Buster Williams BASS TO INFINITY - Movie Trailer","key":"243549346","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-19T20:16:34.000Z","id":"602466a9d6c300003e6bc62a"}]}}}
