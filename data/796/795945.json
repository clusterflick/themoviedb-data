Whose sign can only be evoked, divined by a soothsayer in fact. Finally, if the sibyl does not want anything but 'death'; and if her 'voice' remains as phoné; this invoked 'space' - this azimuth - is therefore a visual and sound horizon - aneuphoné. Twisting in flute music and enveloped by the iridescence of the sunset.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/kArA2EVx0Y0oyieGzekOVGotUGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sibilla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2355302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristina Pizzamiglio","original_name":"Cristina Pizzamiglio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602572bdbc2cb3003fa58ffe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973859,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Endimione","original_name":"Endimione","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602572eddd2589003dbc3b0e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973863,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Simone Rachell","original_name":"Simone Rachell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025734395c0af003f559202","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2210642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riccardo Vaia","original_name":"Riccardo Vaia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602572a69d2b63004067d34c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uJ7A2Yph1b8jisx4hePwPTpgrM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kArA2EVx0Y0oyieGzekOVGotUGy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
