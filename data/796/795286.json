Against a backdrop of Islam, revolution and war, they share their views on the veil, the relationship of Iranian women to the West and the long-ranging impacts of the 1979 Revolution on the status of women in their country. What emerges is an image of Iran that resists easy classification, a nation in flux at a unique historical moment, still reeling from the residual effects of the Iran-Iraq war but poised for a new future. An important and timely look at contemporary Iran, WOMEN LIKE US offers surprising insights into the changing role of women in the Middle East from a perspective that rarely makes it to international headlines.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yzE9yNVgIgupLGREu4Enx7ODMxN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WOMEN LIKE US: WOMEN IN IRAN","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yzE9yNVgIgupLGREu4Enx7ODMxN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
