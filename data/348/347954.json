Once back, Saul seeks a reunion with his estranged young daughter. Guided by a sympathetic parole officer, who discovers his hidden illiteracy, Saul begins writing a letter to his daughter and begins a journey of self-discovery amid pressure from his gangland Avenidas familia. As Saul separates himself from old friends, he mentors a troubled teenage neighbor following an all-too-familiar gang path. Based on a true story, \"Avenues\" tells a deeply personal story of fatherhood and the isolation felt by former convicts.","popularity":0.6913,"poster_path":"/gQ9JiCRJEAUDqy0GtdTQgGpnavs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avenues","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey
