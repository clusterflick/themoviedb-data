A both eerie and infinitely fascinating archive that she herself has now sorted out and reassembled. Her father's transgressive voyeurism is turned against himself, while a courageous self portrait simultaneously grows out of the almost incestuously intimate 'home movies'. The result is a family expos√© that can't be shaken off that easily, and which in an intelligent and absolutely unique way raises the question about the right to not be seen - a question that has become even more relevant in the present day.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Father's Voyeuristic Obsession with his Daughter","title":"The Marina Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1483479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Lutz","original_name":"Marina Lutz","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55938080c3a36804f3001d0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1380916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
