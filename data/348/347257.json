The story starts with a dying old woman, who is calling for her distant son. Her calls take solid form in the shape of a giant breadfruit, which falls from the sky right in front of her son's residence. Realizing that this is a message from his mother, the son sets out to find her and takes the fruit with him. His trek across the island involves interactions both with people who are either amused or disturbed by his abnormal fruit, and with those to whom the fruit seems to an answer to their \"fantasies\", \"desires and dark longings\".","popularity":0.148,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":100524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baumhaus Film Brödl","origin_country":""},{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Fruit from the Equator","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacinto Alfonso","original_name":"Jacinto Alfonso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a591c3a368151a01e5b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atalmira","original_name":"Atalmira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a59bc3a368151a01e5c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simão de Sousa","original_name":"Simão de Sousa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a59fc3a3681526015679","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Neto","original_name":"Maria Neto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a5a40e0a2633a7018b76","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Manuel Noronha","original_name":"José Manuel Noronha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a5ac9251410dcb017914","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patriky","original_name":"Patriky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a5b1c3a368151001cc4d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Quaresma","original_name":"João Quaresma","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a5bac3a368152601568e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascoa Soares","original_name":"Pascoa Soares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb6a5c29251410dbc019a58","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Brödl","original_name":"Herbert Brödl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5595e67e9251416832000418","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Brödl","original_name":"Herbert Brödl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb6a584c3a368152901c7c1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0412751","wikidata_id":"Q15732838","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
