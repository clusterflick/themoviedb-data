In Daylight Moon, he reaches even further back, to try to recall the moments in which a small child configures the world out of patterns of visual fascination, a mode of seeing that relies on touch and the feel of things rather than deep space. One of his most abstract films, Daylight Moon rarely reveals a human figure. Instead of characters, Klahr gives us the play of enigmatic spaces and empty sites that promise both the invitation of desire and the discovery of crime\" Tom Gunning","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/AtF8tUxHypN5SInKxKvHbT6D0xU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daylight Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis Klahr","original_name":"Lewis Klahr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ad2b8c3a36824eb000173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0360504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtF8tUxHypN5SInKxKvHbT6D0xU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":830}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2002-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
