Born and raised in the Ukraine in the period between Stalin and Gorbatschow he left the country in the 80s. In his Installations and his numerous paintings Kabakov creates a world of its own, which leaves the heaviness of socialist and post-socialist life far behind. The film links Ilya Kabakovs artistic spaces with insights into Russian everyday life, which itself sometimes appears like an installation by the artist.","popularity":0.3036,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":41570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmtank","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2009-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flys and Angels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilya Kabakov","original_name":"Ilya Kabakov","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"559bf74192514155c500005d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Kabakov","original_name":"Emilia Kabakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"559bf74b92514155c500005f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485249,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Stutterheim","original_name":"Kerstin Stutterheim","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559bf099c3a368719a001aa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Bolbrinker","original_name":"Niels Bolbrinker","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/k3QJKcgl4kHbRF58b0Kp0Sx8uXZ.jpg","credit_id":"559bf0c0c3a36871950019d3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Bolbrinker","original_name":"Niels Bolbrinker","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/k3QJKcgl4kHbRF58b0Kp0Sx8uXZ.jpg","credit_id":"559bf0cd9251413cd500194c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Bolbrinker","original_name":"Niels Bolbrinker","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/k3QJKcgl4kHbRF58b0Kp0Sx8uXZ.jpg","credit_id":"559bf0af9251413ccf0019fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485249,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kerstin Stutterheim","original_name":"Kerstin Stutterheim","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559bf081c3a368717b001b33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1622980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":3469,"name":"utopia"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":158697,"name":"installation"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":212968,"name":"kyiv (kiev), ukraine"},{"id":215468,"name":"post-socialism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
