Eight of them live together under constant supervision and care. They are all in the first phase of the disease: bouts of lucidity, forgetfulness and falling into oblivion constantly alternate. The patients live their lives, as long as they're capable. The film is a 'tranche de vie': a portrait of the daily coming and going of people in that particular and ditto state. It is also the portrait of a brutal disease that irreversible expropriates the memory from the characters. Eventually the characters will have changed. Because of their illness, they may have been disappeared completely, physically or mentally.","popularity":0.1529,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associate Directors","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Down Memory Lane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klara van Es","original_name":"Klara van Es","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593b517c3a3682cc80011b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483581,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bram Crols","original_name":"Bram Crols","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593b531c3a36804f3002137","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1653956","wikidata_id":"Q2013146","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5903,"name":"alzheimer's disease"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
