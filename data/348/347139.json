When Shao Ming learns that Feng Ling is the daughter of Cheong Ah Choy, he approaches Feng Ling and the two become friends and fall in love with each other. Their relationship goes through many challenges bringing them apart for some time but alas, fate brings them back together in the beautiful Lion City, with consent from their parents to get married.  Lion City is the first Chinese film produced by Cathay-Keris in post-war Singapore. The film is highly valued today for its scenic panoramic shots of Singapore in the 1960s as well as references to the political conditions of the time. It is one of the few Chinese films shot from a Chinese perspective during a time when Malay films dominated the industry.","popularity":0.5325,"poster_path":"/6gngXNRCPk1yIikpKWsMyrnCluJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lion City","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"Bandar Raya Singapura","type":"Malay title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchid Wong","original_name":"Orchid Wong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Feng Ling","credit_id":"5594bd579251415a0f001546","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pan En","original_name":"Pan En","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Shao Ming","credit_id":"5594bd79c3a36870d5001315","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yi Sui","original_name":"Yi Sui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5594bd38c3a36870d90013d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4834684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sD4aATGtO1eSnw0AlzTn34F5xfW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gngXNRCPk1yIikpKWsMyrnCluJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":627}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14514,"name":"class differences"},{"id":191298,"name":"factory girl"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
