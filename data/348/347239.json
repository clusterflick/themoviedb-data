Director Marjoleine Boonstra encounters lone wolves, leading secluded lives in makeshift shelters, and people that work as pilots, night watchmen or skippers. According to a young pilot `it was actually like a dream', working by the IJ river at night. And this is what it looks like: a dream world. Between interviews, Boonstra makes her camera glide through the area, along the quay, across the water, along cranes, containers and sea-going vessels. A world of lamps, reflections and shadows. In this landscape of stone and metal, an extraordinary group of individuals lives and works. For example, an English woman cleans up a submarine for a party, a refugee from former Yugoslavia has created a place for himself and a night watchman has to `see to it that that boat stays where it is'. Peaceful music emphasises the relative quiet, in which the interviewees reflect on their lives and the harbour.","popularity":0.3152,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19962,"logo_path":"/ppbBv0isUhxiI1UABAn89lIUhn6.png","name":"Pieter van Huystee Film & TV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2004-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haven, Roaming Through the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marjoleine Boonstra","original_name":"Marjoleine Boonstra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55959f769251417dc90000ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marjoleine Boonstra","original_name":"Marjoleine Boonstra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55959bfc9251414748001918","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185251,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pieter van Huystee","original_name":"Pieter van Huystee","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55959f6ac3a368146d001633","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":587,"name":"amsterdam, netherlands"},{"id":207557,"name":"docks"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
