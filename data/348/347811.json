Over the next 40 years, they build a self-governed community with the hope of becoming legitimate.  Finding it politically unpopular to evict the settlers, the Danish government declared Christiania a \"short-term social experiment\". Following 40 years of tense relations with the government, much of it focusing on the open hashish trade, Christiania is on its way to becoming a legitimate community.  Christiania was born in 1971 when youthful idealism and a severe housing shortage incited hundreds of young people to occupy 85 acres of deserted brick buildings, woods, ramparts and canals as their home.","popularity":0.064,"poster_path":"/gBJ6Qgxr8op4S0bUdmEOW0E99pB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bus No. 8","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"40 Years of Occupation","title":"Christiania: 40 Years of Occupation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Christiania: 40 Years of Occupation","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5351406,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Jackman","original_name":"Richard Jackman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1a7daaa77e08af7999da8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5351406,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Jackman","original_name":"Richard Jackman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1a7f1ddf9194387d90ed7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lawson","original_name":"Robert Lawson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1a8488b1f32eb79d99516","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lawson","original_name":"Robert Lawson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1a877eddec28b03ad3686","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":781,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBJ6Qgxr8op4S0bUdmEOW0E99pB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Architecture & Design Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
