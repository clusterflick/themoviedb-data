From an illegible note found on a dollhouse bed, through impossible landscapes, the man waits for her train which never arrives. His wanderings lead him to the other side of the tracks, a forgotten landscape of derelict erector-set buildings populated by lost souls. Dream merges with nightmare in this post-industrial land of vivid night.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/cmzp7QXmCRoPrynypP7GzfKCC9H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Motion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janie Geiser","original_name":"Janie Geiser","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/1rgqjWeJNfuOqCTWax9hg2VMQXD.jpg","credit_id":"559ad135c3a36824fe000147","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4302492","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxndCtYdztGkUrPV772aaG2GE14.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cmzp7QXmCRoPrynypP7GzfKCC9H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
