By the side of this tomb, lies the abandoned grave of American soldier Edmond William Quer. The inscription in his grave says that he died at the age of 22, in1946, just one year after the end of World War II. Mrs. Bertha was very intrigued by this and she used to leave a flower for the soldier every time she visited the cemetery. This became a family tradition that endures even after her death and is carried by her sons and nephews. One of her nephews took on the task of investigating the origin of this Unknown Soldier.","popularity":0.2747,"poster_path":"/8SqJL9XdTa6RVxx4bE8la41EyRc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flores para el soldado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198845,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Cappelletti","original_name":"Joe Cappelletti","popularity":0.2103,"profile_path":"/wRCVC9vmeJpmzwMce0HF65nazVQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55938805c3a3682d35000da0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483495,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francisco Javier Garza Yánez","original_name":"Francisco Javier Garza Yánez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559387099251415df80030ac","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván García","original_name":"Iván García","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593871292514152db0031b1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Galo","original_name":"Daniel Galo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559386c1c3a3682d35000d7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván García","original_name":"Iván García","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559386d2925141674c000aed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483495,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francisco Javier Garza Yánez","original_name":"Francisco Javier Garza Yánez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559386ec925141638600015e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1291529","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8SqJL9XdTa6RVxx4bE8la41EyRc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Flores para el Soldado - Trailer","key":"MKFIqGq9qrY","published_at":"2010-05-04T04:02:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"559387dc92514167fd0009f5"}]}}}
