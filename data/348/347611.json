The family has been raised in a most unconventional manner, with Mona having a much younger lover and the father Ralph keeping his own lover on the side. As Patricia grows older, she attracts the attention of her mother's former lover, the much older (than Patricia, who in the book is in her early to mid teens) Carey Scott. Patricia tempts fate with her wild ways, nearly loses her virtue to a musician aboard an ocean-going boat, and is saved in time by Carey. Realizing that he is the man for her, she settles down into an experimental marriage.","popularity":0.6428,"poster_path":"/gXaXw59nDbeoc60yKuGdZi1ErBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42184,"logo_path":null,"name":"John McCormick Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Far Can a Girl Go.","title":"Flaming Youth","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Moore","original_name":"Colleen Moore","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/zWnl0isnoRAUCOmZmYvJMqo8FBk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Patricia Fentriss","credit_id":"5599c565c3a3685f1f00234f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Sills","original_name":"Milton Sills","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/eJTx8Tzq7wx9PwnuHm1cb27KSDx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cary Scott","credit_id":"5723540ec3a3682d3f00283a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Dexter","original_name":"Elliott Dexter","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/A4PeHk6k2qeVN4DjI0VmcxdvDW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Bobs","credit_id":"5723541a92514176da002138","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Breamer","original_name":"Sylvia Breamer","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/xOXMyffJQJ5JV14aFByvXL81LXU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dee Fentriss","credit_id":"572354269251413eaf0027a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrtle Stedman","original_name":"Myrtle Stedman","popularity":0.1927,"profile_path":"/stvYIiwLEzDgdd1OBHZT1yUVe16.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mona Fentriss","credit_id":"57235432c3a3682d3f002843","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Francis Dillon","original_name":"John Francis Dillon","popularity":0.2146,"profile_path":"/8WWebUUEfcpcTvUNhFAeeoPRQbR.jpg","credit_id":"5599c3e1c3a3685f80002708","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29250,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry O.
