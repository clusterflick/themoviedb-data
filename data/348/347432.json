Their stories are told from the point of view of their daily lives where sport, family live and relationships intermingle in a complex and often contradictory whole. All these women share the desire to triumph in sports normally considered to be men´s sports. Some of them pursue their dream while working at other jobs such as driving taxis, selling tacos or being lawyers. They are not women victims, trapped in the family or in marriage; for the simple reason that they are still fighting, they have not accepted defeat. This documentary looks at the feminine aspect of these sports and the unfairness that there is.","popularity":0.6527,"poster_path":"/gmf2bemW1WCLO54F0WanTFTdfee.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65092,"logo_path":null,"name":"CALACAS Y PALOMAS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2008-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brain Is Better Than Brawn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Rodenbaugh","original_name":"Andrea Rodenbaugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55977811c3a36855e6000b9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgina González","original_name":"Georgina González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5597781fc3a36855ed000c39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlyn Corral","original_name":"Charlyn Corral","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5597782c9251413da6000cb4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maribel Domínguez","original_name":"Maribel Domínguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55977844c3a36855ed000c40","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Serrano","original_name":"Laura Serrano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"559778699251413d9f000b6e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María del Carmen de Lara","original_name":"María del Carmen de Lara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559778979251413d91000c9b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María del Carmen de Lara","original_name":"María del Carmen de Lara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5597788dc3a36855e8000baa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196214,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Enrique Ojeda","original_name":"Enrique Ojeda","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c953ec1c3a3683dbff33a45","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leopoldo Best","original_name":"Leopoldo Best","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c953f39c3a3682e5ff3e635","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miguel Ravelo","original_name":"Miguel Ravelo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c953f4dc3a3682e5bf3e66a","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271192,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eduardo Aparicio","original_name":"Eduardo Aparicio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c953fd4925141731e767c62","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alethia Hernández","original_name":"Alethia Hernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c953f16c3a3682e66f3e757","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leopoldo Best","original_name":"Leopoldo Best","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c953edfc3a3682e5bf3e592","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520374,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Suárez Coellar","original_name":"Jorge Suárez Coellar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff8a119bbcae0003fadb403","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1155770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLVoCdhpG11XAXxojnXn7pPk7Pp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gmf2bemW1WCLO54F0WanTFTdfee.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1015}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2278,"name":"women's football (soccer)"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":232812,"name":"women boxer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
