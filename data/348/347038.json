Four factories in the metropolitan area of Mexico City are taken as spots for anthropological exploration. Documenting industrial landscapes, factories, bosses, workers, machines and commodities, the film shows a reflection on how these relationships have an imprint on society outside the factories. This is a testimony on the dignity of workers and their daily labor, with all the effort it entails and how it is rendered invisible by consumer society.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/vj1XFIRIF4OolT4Bk3mSfVjztAv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tesis laboral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Antonio Hernández Martínez","original_name":"José Antonio Hernández Martínez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559391f8c3a3682d35000e90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Antonio Hernández Martínez","original_name":"José Antonio Hernández Martínez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5593920792514152db0032cd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1945190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vj1XFIRIF4OolT4Bk3mSfVjztAv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
