But in the meantime here's Volume 3. Volume three of the Jackass series contains a random, haggard selection of segments and bits that aired on our crappy little television show. Memorable moments in this half-ass collection include the recitation of the Gettysburg Address by Johnny Knoxville while a beard of leeches is applied to his ruggedly handsome face, Chris Pontius stripping down for the pleasure of five other dudes, Wee Man and Preston Lacy pulling a \"poo switcheroo\" with a porta-potty, Dave England digging through the trash and unearthing a tasty treat in a diaper, and a bunch of other absurd stunts, pranks and queer misbehavior from our bumbling cat and crew of idiots.","popularity":1.2413,"poster_path":"/zdQYkdHplI9TvZSem3GLWiRQSho.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dickhouse
