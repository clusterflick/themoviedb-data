Meanwhile, Luli is still as vain as ever and overshadows her poor brother, Fernando. As a new year begins at High School Mexico (HSM, initially interpreted), the school has announced a \"Battle of the Bands\" contest hosted by Jesse & Joy. Working against the clock and with limited resources, Cristobal, Mariana, and a few of their peers unite as a band. In a desperate effort, Luli dares the impossible task of separating Cristobal from his friends. But only one band will be the winner; the one who understands that teamwork, personal development, and hard work will not only make them better artists but also better people.","popularity":0.9913,"poster_path":"/iZPXA4l4t5ZlIQgLUddCcr6oBk4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21117,"logo_path":"/u7PF2BkvV0obzWhdEnz7fGxz5UT.png","name":"TV
