Taking full advantage of the increased audio capabilities of the DVD format each track is also remixed for full 5.1 surround sound.  Each track has its own video with a unique visual style. Much like the audio however while many of the visuals are exactly what you'd expect from a Lemon Jelly release some are very different to anything we've seen before.  Although the DVD itself is devoid of special features, contained in the specially created packaging are 4 postcards and a large (A1 sized) double-sided poster.  The DVD can be played as a movie (i.e. as a sequential play through of all the tracks in album order) or as individual tracks.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pWHwwD3gJASab81Nxl0J8DLJ9Qj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"'64-'95","title":"Lemon Jelly 64 - 95","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":881,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWHwwD3gJASab81Nxl0J8DLJ9Qj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"Exempt","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
