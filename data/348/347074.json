Full Frontal Nerdity guaranteed!  Stand-up mathematician Matt Parker (Discovery Channel You Have Been Warned), experiments maestro Steve Mould (ITV1 I Never Knew That About Britain) and geek songstress Helen Arney (BBC2 Coast) mix astonishing science with statistically significant comedy, plus experiments that electrify their audiences – sometimes literally.  Since their last smash hit tour show Full Frontal Nerdity, the Nerds have filmed their first DVD (available now) and racked up over a million views on YouTube for their experiments, songs and stand-up. As well as sell-out shows all over the UK, the Nerds have performed at Shakespeare’s Globe, Hammersmith Apollo with Robin Ince and Brian Cox, The British Library, TED, Udderbelly and Latitude Festival.","popularity":0.4836,"poster_path":"/6Xd7xldG4wloFLMoXbVdXQyk5NW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Frontal Nerdity","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"FOSTN; Full Frontal Nerdity","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Festival of The Spoken Nerd: Full Frontal Nerdity","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1484118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Arney","original_name":"Helen Arney","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/nxYEhtNvQ5E66AnbsCadvasgq5A.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"55964ad59251414e06000ee7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Parker","original_name":"Matt Parker","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/qD26GO1iJLqhAqrf85bXD8RYSGM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55964b0b92514149f80009ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Mould","original_name":"Steve Mould","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/uFurq2vuCSeH15TGVre5HW9DwKr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55964b19925141093e001545","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6333358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zE5ZrVPam777rrS6Zh1bFHxpkIB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6Xd7xldG4wloFLMoXbVdXQyk5NW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1706,"name":"experiment"},{"id":5801,"name":"nerd"},{"id":5800,"name":"geek"},{"id":215406,"name":"spreadsheets"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Full Frontal Nerdity: DVD and download from Festival of the Spoken Nerd","key":"rfM5PhBfWOQ","published_at":"2015-06-26T12:53:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"559649d1c3a368589600160a"}]}}}
