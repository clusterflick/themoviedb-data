The latter sifted through the turbulent life story of Hopper, who is primarily known from the cult film Easy Rider (1969). Hopper went through as many high as low points. In conveniently arranged chapters, Hoffman shows the decisive moments in Hopper's life and asks colleagues like Wim Wenders, David Lynch, Sean Penn and Julian Schnabel to comment on them. The documentary is richly illustrated with film excerpts, photos, newspaper articles and anecdotes. The main reason for this film was the retrospective of Dennis Hopper's art work in the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum in 2001.","popularity":0.888,"poster_path":"/66imNA53RjBClwJoKru2IgXMGMH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47251,"logo_path":"/bL1c2INFMGR8XceGU8MO4y8EB7F.png","name":"IDTV
