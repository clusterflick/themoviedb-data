But they get more than they bargained for when they enter the strangely ever-changing layout, lair of the most powerful spirits they’ve ever faced. For once inside the derelict structure an omnipresent evil begins manipulating the team, and the higher they climb the more everything spirals out of control. For heaven’s sake, don’t go up! From the filmmakers behind 88 and DEAD BEFORE DAWN 3D comes a classy chiller to leave you super-creeped out.","popularity":0.9191,"poster_path":"/2ZsE0oe3CIi20D0ezXXQN4ebGvM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40157,"logo_path":"/b5QIOxFGZcZCKPlvfUYzaESABKv.png","name":"Wango
