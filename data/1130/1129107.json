Through song and dance, the new film will explore Orlando’s 400 year journey, with questions of class, race, sex, Britain’s imperialist history and what it means to be British now. In a departure from the original novel and film, a Black narrator and chorus will operate as a guide for the audience, bringing to light stories that were not told in the book and its adaptation.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":36765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adventure Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orlando, Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soloman Golding","original_name":"Soloman Golding","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64680dcf33a376013b3d94ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Sheppard","original_name":"Christopher Sheppard","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64680de033a376011ec3637c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Potter","original_name":"Sally Potter","popularity":0.1273,"profile_path":"/7hzuG6C7GD8gbBtqdoHOfwQ3P5M.jpg","credit_id":"64680d7bc3514c01577983c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57463,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Virginia Woolf","original_name":"Virginia Woolf","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/eP0eJlZ8v2TsLwhvst7jw76mL6f.jpg","credit_id":"64680d8f2bcf670172b0d36f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3455980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Vymeris","original_name":"Joanna Vymeris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64680db0d1857201619116c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27802385","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
