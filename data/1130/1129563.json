Bernstein drew analogies to other disciplines, such as poetry, aesthetics, and especially linguistics, hoping to make these lectures accessible to an audience with limited or no musical experience, while maintaining an intelligent level of discourse: Lecture 5 picks up at the early twentieth century with an oncoming crisis in Western Music. As these lectures have traced the gradual increase and oversaturation of ambiguity, Bernstein now designates a point in history that took ambiguity too far.","popularity":1.0451,"poster_path":"/4IPge3H4SQfiYZtiqSI2O7LrUWJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvard Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-11","revenue":2000,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bernstein at Harvard","title":"The Unanswered Question V : The Twentieth Century Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Unanswered Question Volume 5","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6469c188a5046e0124681e7d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6469c19dc3514c0100fe5f49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0175479","wikidata_id":"Q152509","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eF4j5B6PYpH4rhzXS0GgHHvDvxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1747}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4IPge3H4SQfiYZtiqSI2O7LrUWJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":853},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eYC2Nca7FCY7JuWsMkf2okMeNPj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":156181,"name":"lecture"},{"id":220414,"name":"linguistics"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":299169,"name":"leonard bernstein"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Unanswered Question 1973 5 The XXth Century Crisis Bernstein Norton","key":"kPGstQUbpHQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-04-08T08:36:52.000Z","id":"6469c27a2bcf670172b1abcc"}]}}}
