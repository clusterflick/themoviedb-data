For his birthday, his grandfather gives him a book. He would have preferred a video game, but what can you expect from a grandfather who spends his time building violins in his workshop? But this is a magic book! When you draw in it, it plays the Four Seasons: it’s an activity book, a herbarium, a sketchbook... The orchestra playing the music is inside the book, on the other side of each page... drawings come to life and join the orchestra in an imaginary space. The book accompanies Anthony throughout the seasons until his eleventh birthday.","popularity":0.2067,"poster_path":"/mgaOK5gxEmCyb5L6dxgEFHvmJqy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antoine’s four Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Richard","original_name":"Pierre Richard","popularity":1.3509,"profile_path":"/2hTxDJOdBrvqJy8yFHnLzqG4yBe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Le grand-père","credit_id":"6469a949c1606a0156d7d918","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4072861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myles Dillon","original_name":"Myles Dillon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Antoine","credit_id":"6469a965006b01018958da35","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4072875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon","original_name":"Gordon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6469aba4006b010147ea248a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Béziat","original_name":"Philippe Béziat","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6469a992006b0100e6b48c5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8708282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGWQthA1UFH09cYfhSpk14SOvUu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgaOK5gxEmCyb5L6dxgEFHvmJqy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
