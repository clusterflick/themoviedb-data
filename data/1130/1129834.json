With NGOs being blocked by red tape and the absence of any positive action by French or British authorities, the film is a behind-the-scenes look at the unprecedented grassroots movement that rose to aid the refugees in Calais, and the community that sprang up there, before it was forcefully demolished. This is the story of what happens when young and inexperienced citizens are forced to devise systems and structures to support 10,000 refugees; and are left unguided to face the moral and emotional conflicts, blurred lines and frequent grey areas of giving aid to vulnerable people. People who do not want to be there. It questions whether the aims of the volunteers were met, and whether these aims ultimately served the refugees' needs.","popularity":0.8164,"poster_path":"/3MmG6GBPauUisFmToNFLBeJ8fr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222040,"logo_path":null,"name":"SE15 Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":103592,"logo_path":null,"name":"WISLOCKI Films","origin_country":""},{"id":73122,"logo_path":"/oiPvX2fbRoKrhbVg30WpW4ngrrt.png","name":"Jeva Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the Calais Jungle was ignored & condemned by authorities, ordinary people stepped in to support the refugees.
