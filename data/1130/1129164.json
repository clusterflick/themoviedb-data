Although she is living in a small cottage in the middle of nowhere, her past life in New York City continues to loop around in her mind... words that she spoke insincerely before she took a personal vow of silence, and memories of the 'living slumber' that she seemed to operate in. As she pieces together her life in the serenity of the nature around her, an unlikely teenage companion shows up and is the only person willing to accept her for the blank slate that she is trying to become.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Days of America","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461032","wikidata_id":"Q3827392","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
