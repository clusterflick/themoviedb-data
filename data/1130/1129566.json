Bernstein drew analogies to other disciplines, such as poetry, aesthetics, and especially linguistics, hoping to make these lectures accessible to an audience with limited or no musical experience, while maintaining an intelligent level of discourse: This lecture takes its name from a line in John Keats' poem, \"On the Grasshopper and Cricket\". Bernstein does not discuss Keats' poem directly in this chapter, but he provides his own definition of the poetry of earth, which is tonality. Tonality is the poetry of earth because of the phonological universals discussed in lecture 1. This lecture discusses predominantly Stravinsky, whom Bernstein considers the poet of earth.","popularity":1.184,"poster_path":"/9lNmzFwG4g8yLT78vOdLlS6KFWI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvard Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-11","revenue":2000,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bernstein at Harvard","title":"The Unanswered Question VI : The Poetry of Earth","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Unanswered Question Volume 6","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6469c562c3514c01745c388c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6469c5792bcf67011bf39871","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1834860","wikidata_id":"Q152511","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eF4j5B6PYpH4rhzXS0GgHHvDvxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1747}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9lNmzFwG4g8yLT78vOdLlS6KFWI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":2463,"name":"harvard university"},{"id":156181,"name":"lecture"},{"id":220414,"name":"linguistics"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":299169,"name":"leonard bernstein"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Unanswered Question 1973 6 The Poetry Of Earth Bernstein Norton","key":"OWeQXTnv_xU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-04-08T09:26:47.000Z","id":"6469c631c3514c013a56063e"}]}}}
