Newcomers Audi entered two works supported teams in the form of Audi Sport Team Joest and Audi Sport UK – the start of a long and fruitful association with the race for the German manufacturer.  As one German sportscar manufacturer arrived another departed: Porsche followed up their 1998 triumph by taking a break from Le Mans which was to last until 2014.  With Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Panoz and Toyota there was no shortage of quality in the field and fans eagerly anticipated a mighty tussle for the top spot.  1999 will forever be remembered for one of the most shocking moments of Le Mans history as Mercedes-Benz driver Peter Dumbreck found the take-off speed of his CLR on the Mulsanne Straight – fortunately with no serious injuries.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1999","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1999","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
