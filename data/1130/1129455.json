With a full 48 car grid, glorious sunshine and frisson of controversy the stage was set for a classic Le Mans year.  Qualifying showed Porsche’s new GT1 works machines were going to be formidable contenders for the overall win but Joest Racing’s cleverly packaged TWR-Porsche WSC95 not only had a handy turn of speed but were efficient on fuel and tyres too.  An exciting chase developed as the privateer Joest team took on the mighty Stuttgart factory and the dogfight kept the crowds enthralled through the night and into the final laps.  With 48 cars on the grid there was interest throughout the field.  Porsche’s switch to the GT1 class meant McLaren’s mighty F1s were hard put upon to repeat their sensational 1995 debut success but they were well in the hunt.","popularity":0.0472,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1996","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1996","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
