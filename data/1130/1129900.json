The program explores Cohen's childhood and his subsequent development as one of Canada's leading new writers. The film takes viewers to the house Cohen was brought up in as well as to the places of Montreal he enjoys frequentingâ€”his favorite bistro, a three dollar-a-day hotel, the public park, the exclusive section called Westmount, and a Greek grocery store. Cohen himself is shown at a recording session, at public readings of his poetry, displaying home movies of his childhood, and commenting on university life. He also reflects on his visit to Cuba, his girlfriend in Greece, his obsession with danger and his friends and their personalities.","popularity":0.1625,"poster_path":"/xmPlY0vZxfGSdRqwLmBvFUZMJWu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1967-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creative Person: Leonard Cohen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Cohen","original_name":"Leonard Cohen","popularity":0.222,"profile_path":"/cRHWtGOa7IOJWayAQM3FBLCM82x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646ae594c3514c0100fec1d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Brittain","original_name":"Donald Brittain","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/jSp8rMTzF5HI6ZvdFJ6PrkHJTCv.jpg","credit_id":"646ae613d1857200e5a4d1f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Owen","original_name":"Don Owen","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":"/fbGscACX9xJUDJVsblFHruxEZGX.jpg","credit_id":"646ae62dc3514c01577abff3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135299,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Leach","original_name":"Paul Leach","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ae63ba5046e0189420cc7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171734,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roger Racine","original_name":"Roger Racine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ae64ac3514c013a566c2a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1378,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmPlY0vZxfGSdRqwLmBvFUZMJWu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":919}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
