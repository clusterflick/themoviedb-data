Samurai Sword: Making of a Legend examines the weapon's rich history, painstakingly detailed artistry, and spiritual significance.  Viewers witness each step of the swordsmith process throughout the course of the film. We're shown the careful selection of each of the sword's raw materials, its first casting in unbearably hot temperatures and the many months that are devoted to perfecting the weapon's final design and presentation. It's impossible not to be awed by the exacting detail and diligence with which these artists work. Even more remarkable are the characteristics that make each of the swords unique; no one sword is the exactly the same as another.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/j3qwczS7qAvTRmR8UiXO1f63PUS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samurai Sword The Making Of A Legend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j3qwczS7qAvTRmR8UiXO1f63PUS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
