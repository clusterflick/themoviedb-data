The appeal of being a Celt has rarely diminished over the centuries. Their leaders were men and women of legend - King Arthur of the Britons, the Warrior Queen Boudicca, and Vercingetorix the Gaul. However few people understand who the Celts actually were or what their true legacy is. This powerful series cuts through the romanticism and clich√©d images to give a true picture of Celtic culture. Presenter Richard Rudgley follows the trail back to pre-Roman times, looking into every aspect of Celtic life to show how they adapted to change.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/dqB7pANiwX6XrNKVf5KnWhAhGUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Celts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3174483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Rudgley","original_name":"Richard Rudgley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"646aaac72bcf67011bf3df1c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqB7pANiwX6XrNKVf5KnWhAhGUU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nlFAmHv25RYeR2YY3O2eytB3bQi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
