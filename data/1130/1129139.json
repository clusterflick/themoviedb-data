In this outrageous independent comedy, Nathan, Dom, Justin, and Bob move into their recently deceased Dean's house and start partying. Their good times get a bit set back upon learning that the new President of their university, President Garlin, intends to shut down their art school and turn it into a business school. As Nathan does everything he can to keep their art school active and alive, his roommates continue to party and pick up girls, leading to a concluding confrontation between the students and President Garlin, and a subsequent final party at their house that ends with disastrous results.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eastern College","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1242869","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
