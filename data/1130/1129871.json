Unsafe mining, milling and tailings management by UCIL in this area for almost 30 years has resulted in excessive radiation, contamination of water, land and air, destruction of the local ecology, and lead for to genetic mutation, and slow death for the people of the region. The film attempts to depict the gross misuse of power by the authorities in displacing the original inhabitants of the region, the utter lack of concern for internationally accepted norms and safety precautions in the handling of uranium and its by-products, and their callousness of its disastrous impact on the people and the region.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/nV534ESereoqoDlnBKbJCJE8wEz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buddha Weeps in Jadugoda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2641633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shriprakash","original_name":"Shriprakash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ac601a5046e01246870d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0325128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6uoHbOSBYZZnz8pmlcecJrwYhC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/unIVJAQRuosSIjuCzbMtpy1ycFh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fBo6oeJGGPGvu2obh5SH9kwe2J8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":777,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nV534ESereoqoDlnBKbJCJE8wEz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":518},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":924,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xcfDZI51qD5qJqhd42zd96ZP9BZ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":616}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film South Asia ","release_date":"1999-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"tfsa2001","release_date":"2001-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"youtube","release_date":"2007-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
