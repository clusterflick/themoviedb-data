Three years in the making, award-winning film-maker Terry Abraham’s photography captures the beauty of the Lakeland fells and wildlife through the seasons and the insights of those that live by, care for and visit the mountain.  Sharing their wide-ranging expertise and passion for the peak, the film’s contributors create a picture of Helvellyn that combines nature, adventure sports, art, survival and history, and features an exhilarating RAF low-level fighter plane flight through its stunning and much-loved landscape.  This is the final instalment in Terry Abraham’s popular Lake District trilogy. His other two films feature Scafell Pike and Blencathra.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qR8WDc2UbXKaif3GtO0VrSqvoq7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Terry Abraham's film of Helvellyn features a low-level flight through its landscape.","title":"Life of a Mountain: A Year on Helvellyn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Abraham","original_name":"Terry Abraham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cacbfadba14916062b50a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13979302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n5lbf2GVgxUAMZRmq6KJnzSqkFD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qR8WDc2UbXKaif3GtO0VrSqvoq7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1332}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL TEASER - Life of a Mountain: Helvellyn","key":"hhfEgmz8cj8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-05T15:06:15.000Z","id":"67cac92eaa523c748a2b5206"}]}}}
