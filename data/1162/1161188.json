He doesn’t have a promoter or gimmick to get plays on Spotify.  Those who know his talents swear by him.  His sound fills up the room of a 4-piece band without relying on drum loops or triggers. There is simply nobody on earth quite like him.  His song “Oklahoma Breakdown” was covered by Red Dirt artist Stoney Larue and blew up so much in Texas that it was the top-selling single for all of 2007.  This documentary explores why a legend of the underground avoids the limelight when he could be a millionaire.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oklahoma Breakdown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
