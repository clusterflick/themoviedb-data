Following the turmoil of the Bolshevik Revolution, Communist Russia faces the venom of Nazi aggression. 1940's film footage reveals the harsh reality of total war, as the Red Army and Soviet civilians alike confront a brutal and tenacious enemy.  The following decades are darkened by tensions between the USSR and foreign powers, and violent measures taken to silence voices of dissent. Finally, the Soviet people's yearning for a freer society leads to accelerating reforms and the ultimate dissolution of the USSR.","popularity":1.7369,"poster_path":"/rTCxft8bGLo1ekymerA7W1zX7Cs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39402,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madacy Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soviet Union: The Rise and Fall - Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Dorse","original_name":"Daniel Dorse","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64cf278e4d679100e2407572","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1135824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Lenin","original_name":"Vladimir Lenin","popularity":0.2644,"profile_path":"/bdYa6BSGbENc815IIggRXbBs3qx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64cf2823d9f4a603b4a04b40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Stalin","original_name":"Иосиф Сталин","popularity":0.6936,"profile_path":"/hrb1AMgA37rebCsPKK3lpJvclLi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64cf2831d9f4a603b7972ce4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Trotsky","original_name":"Leon Trotsky","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/ugXC8P9qAbLgQa6GpSobIk7x1SX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64cf2849d9f4a603bafa8eb6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4199941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Newsom","original_name":"Ted Newsom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf279d4d679100e2407581","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4199941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Newsom","original_name":"Ted Newsom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf27a64d679100acf09991","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Kamaroff","original_name":"Barbara Kamaroff","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf27b8303c8500ade4344f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199943,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ronald Mark Miller","original_name":"Ronald Mark Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf27c76d4c97010d50c462","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lanny Lee","original_name":"Lanny Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf27d385090f00ae83862a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/beQWulx9RKIgBN3NDhPLCMX3g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rTCxft8bGLo1ekymerA7W1zX7Cs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nj6s6hv9pFBj62ppMTWkycRkRZR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":233974,"name":"russia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
