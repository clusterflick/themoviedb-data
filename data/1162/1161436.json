Not only will she have the opportunity to fight in a potentially career-changing International Boxing Federation match, she will also be taking full-time care of her son. Sisi was born and raised in a conservative family who believe—as many do in China—that motherhood is a woman’s most important job. After her son was born, Sisi suffered severe postnatal depression. Boxing became her way out, away to show the world she existed. With her athletic career reinvigorated, Sisi is constantly dodging accusations about her life choices.
