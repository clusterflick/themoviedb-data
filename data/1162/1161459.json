The story takes place within the familiar Christmas hustle and bustle, complete with stressful gift wrapping, ear-piercing children's squeals, and a traditionally comical family Christmas dinner.  Amidst all the chaos, Pia finds herself in a moment of a different reality, through which she manages to regain her Christmas joy and gets a reminder of how much we need our family's warmth and acceptance in good and bad times.","popularity":0.202,"poster_path":"/gT0Dy9HCqcCvEtAe1Yu4ZefTDVJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baltic Film and Media
