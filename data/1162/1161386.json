Based on this, \"HASC\" appropriates the wisdom of Dziga Vertov and Bruce Conner, who sought to (re-)define \"cinema,\" and models the functioning of realtime sounds and images by (re-) convert/anchor it into a fixed format of non-realtime. The work A MOVIE explores the apparatus of sounds, images, and illusions, attempting to revive the conditions necessary to be designated as a cinema in today's timeline.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/90zBl8eGpvxNKoqZhJco7rbxaHK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"영화","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"motoko+HASC","original_name":"motoko+HASC","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf4779303c8500e338cdef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90zBl8eGpvxNKoqZhJco7rbxaHK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":504}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
