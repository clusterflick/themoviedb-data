Hurricane! Flood!: Wonders of the Weather","overview":"This video presents a look at the forces of nature in their most devastating mode: lightning storms, tornadoes, flash floods, tidal waves, and hurricanes. The film, made for The Discovery Channel, accompanies professional storm chasers as they ride into the eye of a category five hurricane to gather data and get a close-up view. There is footage of a tornado with 300-mile-per-hour winds, as well as 100-foot tidal waves hurtling towards shore at 500 miles per hour. The viewer witnesses a flash flood and hears an interview with a lightning strike survivor.","popularity":0.4185,"poster_path":"/qGcw4rr6XrFwcfvRkrwtFVft827.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pioneer Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tornado!
