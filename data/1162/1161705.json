Zirkel Wilderness. It briefly chronicles both a climb and the struggle to document it using a handmade photographic emulsion that was prepared and coated onto celluloid outside on a rock at night using water from a rushing creek, rolled up before dawn during a lightning storm, shot under the constant threat of more lightning, and processed carefully on-location the next night. What results is presented as it came out of the camera, the result of a collaboration between the filmmakers and the wilderness environment where they lived for a week.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/iFq5XsnxwSxdvQ3fMcSk5jPEGeC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"in lightning Agnes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Schaller","original_name":"Robert Schaller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d067ee6d4c9700afae66bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2210200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armand Yervant Tufenkian","original_name":"Armand Yervant Tufenkian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce349d59ae03efe32a9cf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3545109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curt Heiner","original_name":"Curt Heiner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce34e83c25444882e2f441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iFq5XsnxwSxdvQ3fMcSk5jPEGeC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
