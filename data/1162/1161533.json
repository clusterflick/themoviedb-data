Begin in Madrid's Royal Palace and see the paintings of Velázquez and El Greco, then go on to the Prado for Goya. Stroll through the oldest part of the city, to the Plaza Mayor and the restaurant Botin, where Hemingway dined. Take an excursion to Ávila, the walled 11th century home of Saint Teresa. Continue on to the Alcazar at Segovia; Toledo and the famed cathedral; Córdoba and its gypsy caves. Savor the exotic flavor of Granada, center of Moorish Spain, and pause in the Alhambra, where nightingales sing in the gardens. Soak up sun along the Costa del Sol and then complete your tour in Barcelona, Spain's second city.","popularity":0.2773,"poster_path":"/yr9iksxuFR1WMLjLLfqeUWvm9k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203273,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Video Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spain: Everything Under the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Cimino","original_name":"Rick Cimino","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64cfd12785090f00e7974931","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4196925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Valentini","original_name":"Chris Valentini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfd0f785090f00c87d6586","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4196930,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Scholz","original_name":"Julie Scholz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfd101549dda00e2dd82ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200916,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julie Winokur","original_name":"Julie Winokur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfd1114d679100c52c9735","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202031,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Weiner","original_name":"Robert Weiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d091a56d4c9700ec585673","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202032,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Berger","original_name":"Jeff Berger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d091da4d679100c52cee2d","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202033,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Maguire","original_name":"John Maguire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d091e64d679100e2411474","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268951,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bud Ryerson","original_name":"Bud Ryerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d091f2549dda00acf0fb90","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202034,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James R.
