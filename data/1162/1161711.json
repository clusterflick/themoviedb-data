The piece was constructed using old family Super8 footage, off-air TV material and some live footage shot in Sheffield. The soundtrack was constructed using some very basic monophonic synthesisers and a 4 track recorder on which I remixed some material found in the art school library.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9ajq6iKFA59coN0MXpk330aj1m8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warning, Attack, Recovery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4201947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clive Gillman","original_name":"Clive Gillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d070d467e0f7013c402d35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ajq6iKFA59coN0MXpk330aj1m8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
