It starts with a contemplation of ethnographic recordings produced by American anthropologists in the late 19th century who used phonographs to record the music and language of endangered indigenous peoples. The song in the video is Love Song: Ar-ra-rang 1 recorded on a wax cylinder in 1896 by American anthropologist Alice Fletcher, who requested its performance by three Korean students in Washington at the time. This was apparently the first example in the history of Korean traditional music being captured with a recording medium.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Future Listeners I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"미래의 청취자들에게 1","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4200068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youngeun Kim","original_name":"Youngeun Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf46b0549dda013932d9c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Film Freeway","release_date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
