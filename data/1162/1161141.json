Marvel at the panorama from the top of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. Walk down the Champs-Élysées from l'Etoile to Place de la Concorde. Go inside Maxim's and Tour d'Argent to experience an elegant French meal, then pause at Dux magots for a cafe au lait. Stroll along the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore and window shop at Dior and Lanvin. Enter the Louvre to view Winged VIctory, Venus de Milo and Mona Lisa. Glide down the Seine on a bateau mouche, past Notre Dame and the Ile St. Louis. Zoom through traffic in a Parisian taxi and ride the Metro. Climb to Montmartre, Sacre Coeur and Place du Tertre. Take a side trip to Versailles and be dazzled by the Hall of Mirrors.","popularity":0.2417,"poster_path":"/rsYelE8sPWCm9M2KaTvo5o8EVuU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205571,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Visa Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Visits: In Love with Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Devenney","original_name":"Scott Devenney","popularity":0.0908,"profile_path":"/bgKT3Q5zCX26FUAdipT3S9BbbuB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64ceb395fa27f400ac9e09db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1450769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Power","original_name":"Carolyn Power","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/vFcbYIi9LH4n7WXpLpCwXr2OsVT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64ceb39d85090f0106913e0d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Marie Leduc","original_name":"Jean-Marie Leduc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ceb3b26d4c9700ec578a6e","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199390,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barry Levinson","original_name":"Barry Levinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ceb4104d679100e2403d46","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199382,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valerie Archer","original_name":"Valerie Archer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ceb340614c6d00e2bcc371","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65611,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Keating","original_name":"Kevin Keating","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ceb34b303c8500ade3fa1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Conner","original_name":"Jim Conner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ceb41a614c6d011c2a9dfe","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199387,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phil Arfman","original_name":"Phil Arfman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ceb3c0d9f4a603b6c89046","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yJFreTc56Cz0xQukPuu84RneKBU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rsYelE8sPWCm9M2KaTvo5o8EVuU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":90,"name":"paris, france"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":11616,"name":"vhs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
