An unexpected turn means the team has to fight to play. Their campaign challenges age old sporting traditions and joins the wider movement for gender equity. Following a wildly diverse group of people across the spectrum of age, body shape, gender identity, sexuality and skill level, they come together to courageously challenge notions of what it is to play football, how itâ€™s played and who has the right to play it.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/spr4QWs1ZDBmSl8tHcd9rLPGY7x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When
