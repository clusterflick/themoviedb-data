Select physical editions of ‘SMASH’ collect the duo’s videos on Blu-Ray for the first time, with a second disc containing bonus clips and lyric videos (including songs not featured on the audio tracklist), with a bumper 66 visuals presented in total.  The remastered videos especially are a treat to behold, particularly from an act like Pet Shop Boys, for whom the image has always gone hand-in-hand with the music and serves to enhance the overall experience.","popularity":0.4493,"poster_path":"/1pBROySduXpmmZ66mccbEtqoBFS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parlaphone UK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pet Shop Boys Smash The Videos 1985 - 2020","video":true,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Tennant","original_name":"Neil Tennant","popularity":0.2289,"profile_path":"/kc7XqgCZzvq4bxKvwJMjjE1gUIJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cf67ced9f4a603b6c8e24c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Lowe","original_name":"Chris Lowe","popularity":0.2463,"profile_path":"/sIAtf9v5qf3MiGfx3oUL7kRWDwC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64cf67f9d9f4a603bafaacc2","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cIpeEADHFrNchrW6ASeLNakdq5H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1509,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1pBROySduXpmmZ66mccbEtqoBFS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1006},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2823,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/apa8vHYt28WqglxQjVba3l5cwms.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1998},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kIOWgJDUPUvHzlFXQUm5ElXJMhv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":5699,"name":"music video"},{"id":208289,"name":"1980s"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Parlaphone - 5054197296215","release_date":"2023-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pet Shop Boys proudly announce the upcoming release of SMASH - The Singles 1985-2020 - out 16th June","key":"pLZVLp50mBI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-30T13:44:51.000Z","id":"64cf649a4d6791011c179bc6"}]}}}
