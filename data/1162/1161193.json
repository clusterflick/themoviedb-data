This is an important voice of a poet concerned about the future of the world. The drama shows a civilization threatened with extinction, dominated by consumerist ideals, mental emptiness, disappearance of authorities and moral decay. The title character symbolizes life, energy and the immutability of the basic laws of nature. In Barański's staging, he moves in a wheelchair. The piece consists of two parts. The first takes place in a botanical garden, the second in the scenery of a huge junkyard, which symbolizes modern civilization.","popularity":0.1875,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old
