As he helplessly witnesses the fast fading popularity of the puppet theatres and his own team is nearly defunct, Madhab fears that he is heading towards obscurity. Dolls Don’t Die chronicles the battles and dreams of a man who is caught between the rugged realities and the ecstasies of a passionate artist. It celebrates his lonely, gritty fight, which he put up simply to keep his artistic practice alive.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/qoLLZQUN0pEUFA8n91UgtqV1TJO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dolls Don't Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Putulnama","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4199900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ranajit Ray","original_name":"Ranajit Ray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cf1dfafa27f4011c84f71a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cepF02mKuCu8imxXbxEky8o0R8b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qoLLZQUN0pEUFA8n91UgtqV1TJO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wtXnhKKDiT37fIvMrdAi8bfsxta.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3Uw6PsPXnEiHkvZItpfRX65Wggi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2023-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2023-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
