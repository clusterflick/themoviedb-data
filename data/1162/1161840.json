In a fresh approach, this documentary utilizes a New Testament and storyteller's eye to examine the evidence behind the world's most studied artifact and its connection to the historical Jesus. With new digital recreations, expert interviews, and the latest technology, the creators have reconstructed the actual crime scene surrounding Jesus' crucifixion and present a mind- blowing fusion of faith and science for the first time.","popularity":0.0558,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shroud: Face to Face","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3698853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Orlando","original_name":"Robert Orlando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d0f63685090f0106926717","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22082824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
