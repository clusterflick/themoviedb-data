We first meet Jonas (BPM star Felix Maritaud in a riveting performance) in the presentâ€¦ where he's having a rough go of it. He's prone to starting fights at the local gay bar, and his boyfriend has had enough of his infidelity and alcohol-soaked antics. His volatile behavior may stem from a traumatic incident in his past. The film flashes back to 1997, where Jonas (played as a straight-laced high school kid by newcomer Nicolas Bauwens) meets Nathan (Tommy Lee Baik), the rebellious new student who will become Jonas's crush. Jonas and Nathan venture out into the night on their first proper date unaware that it's about to change their lives forever. Charrier teases out the details in this searing mystery.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fZstBdK5id00xpvbahH79VAT2Oh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141138,"logo_path":null,"name":"TLA Releasing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1871353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Maritaud","original_name":"Félix Maritaud","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/sZhU2EyLcWSbZd9RSzNhp7aDghI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64d08354d9f4a603b6c951e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aure Atika","original_name":"Aure Atika","popularity":0.4661,"profile_path":"/1jK3B2T1FTHmM2DPmQt6EzZgAYL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64d08376d9f4a603b54a39c2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2128823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Charrier","original_name":"Christophe Charrier","popularity":0.999,"profile_path":"/nV6G0Njt88hNIEJaqlP5JulMjI1.jpg","credit_id":"64d084afd9f4a603b54a3a8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fZstBdK5id00xpvbahH79VAT2Oh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
