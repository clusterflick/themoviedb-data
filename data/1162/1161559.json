But when Benji doesn't dare drive down a steep hill in a shopping cart, Karl and Julius no longer want to take him with them. Benji is upset about being outside and decides to pull off the stunt anyway. When he hesitates again in the shopping cart at the top of the hill, Karl pushes the cart into motion. After a crazy ride, Benji ends up on the ground at the foot of the hill. The friends cheer, but Benji can't move. Julius calls 112, and Benji blames Karl for the accident. Karl becomes distraught and runs after Julius to meet the ambulance. But when it and the boys get back to the place where Benji was lying, he is gone.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eat Shit and Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anders Morgenthaler","original_name":"Anders Morgenthaler","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/kxtZkdFdfQiAhoWIF5yHxBL0mdh.jpg","credit_id":"64cfe7dc67e0f7013c3ff71d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anders Morgenthaler","original_name":"Anders Morgenthaler","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/kxtZkdFdfQiAhoWIF5yHxBL0mdh.jpg","credit_id":"64cfe7e7549dda00e2dd8a4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1273801","wikidata_id":"Q20728531","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BUSTER Copenhagen International Film Festival for Children and Youth","release_date":"2008-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
