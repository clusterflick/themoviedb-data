He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the 20th century. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counterculture of the 1960’s and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema.  In The Beast of Loch Ness, we tell the untold story that exists within the walls at Boleskine House. A story that is shadowed by the building’s pop-cultural modern-history. This film brings together a colourful group of well-known researchers from across the globe who together explore the history and mystery of Boleskine House, replacing timeworn narratives with new insights.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l9KSAkxZqqWGaHWOhA518jTo7gb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beast of Loch Ness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4201559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Brown","original_name":"Jim Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d026026d4c97012e8b72ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l9KSAkxZqqWGaHWOhA518jTo7gb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
