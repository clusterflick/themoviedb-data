After dozens of releases, thousands of shows, hundreds of brushes with the law, countless line-up changes and one terminally ill diagnosis, the band finally gets their due with this two-hour, in-depth documentary. Featuring interviews with members of the band (past and present), road crew, producers, family, friends and fans, My Life is Great covers the entirety of their storied career. Complete with live footage from the last three decades, this film is a document of a band that never got a break, never gave a damn, and never sold out.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life is Great: The Stevie Stiletto Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray McKelvey","original_name":"Ray McKelvey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"630e2035724de1007b739643","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Butler","original_name":"Michael Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"630e205af54836007f808c2f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Dunn","original_name":"Kevin Dunn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e1f73dcb6a3008008668b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
