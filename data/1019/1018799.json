They get caught trying to short-count him, and he threatens to have them arrested. After a series of disasters--they ruin a customer's suit, their store blows up--they get a telegram notifying them that a man they once did a kindness for has left them quite a bit of money and a house, but in order to get the inheritance, they have to spend a night in the bedroom of the man's house. When they arrive there, they notice two things--the place is kind of creepy and a series of spooky incidents leaves them to believe the house is haunted.","popularity":0.5095,"poster_path":"/sGSrKBCHI3SAMFly9c6WbDN8Bza.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toddy Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A thriller-diller of laffs... chills and thrills","title":"Fight That Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dewey 'Pigmeat' Markham","original_name":"Dewey 'Pigmeat' Markham","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/oYV1eLHsvDiu0o33uBaE6qIndIL.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Pigmeat Markham","credit_id":"630ea5ddd7dcd20079edfa7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John 'Rastus' Murray","original_name":"John 'Rastus' Murray","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Shorty Murray","credit_id":"630ea627d7dcd2009071d153","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percy Verwayen","original_name":"Percy Verwayen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Moneybags Jim","credit_id":"630ea639cb80280082ca49e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bethea","original_name":"David Bethea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Mr. Cook","credit_id":"630ea648ed2ac200827e63a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberta Pryne","original_name":"Alberta Pryne","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Sweet Sue Pryne","credit_id":"630ea658cb8028007d8b335c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3385907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Leyba","original_name":"Claire Leyba","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"630ea6696dc507007dab3ad8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarice Grayham","original_name":"Clarice Grayham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Georgia Brown","credit_id":"630ea678fdc4fa007d25771e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Dillard","original_name":"Bill Dillard","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Jim Brown","credit_id":"630ea68912425c0085392512","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Wiltshire","original_name":"George Wiltshire","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Lawyer Smith","credit_id":"630ea6981511aa00924c1944","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1765184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wen Talbert","original_name":"Wen Talbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"James Henry","credit_id":"630ea6afd7a70a0092994a18","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudy Toombs","original_name":"Rudy Toombs","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"John Mugger","credit_id":"630ea6c0cb80280082ca4a59","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1048004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Woods","original_name":"Milton Woods","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Bill White","credit_id":"630ea6cd7fcab30091dae8ec","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1213864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Allen","original_name":"Raymond Allen","popularity":0.0874,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"Fast Delivery Bill","credit_id":"630ea6e4be55b70083c5a783","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":993256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Easton","original_name":"Sidney Easton","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Spooky Lightning","credit_id":"630ea6f81d3563007d6dbc31","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Newfield","original_name":"Sam Newfield","popularity":0.6187,"profile_path":"/4SXjJuEUwmCLOfl9RKXqz0yO2dx.jpg","credit_id":"630ea4571511aa007ba24f84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136398,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"J.
