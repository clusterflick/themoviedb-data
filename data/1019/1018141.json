Only one of the boys involved tries to help her. But his attempt to take responsibility for his actions gets lost in the self-centred hubbub generated by the mothers and teachers. Shot in one continuous take, the film explores the meaning of truth and reality – not just in terms of content but also on a formal level.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Qi","original_name":"Wang Qi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630c76dd724de10083a1e50e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1919013","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
