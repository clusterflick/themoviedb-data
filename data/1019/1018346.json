Shot on 8mm throughout the spring, this film aimed to capture the essence of the city as something cold and rigid, populated by harsh lines and social alienation. After the film was processed, it was coloured over with a rainbow of shades, suggesting organic life and vibrancy. The colours alternate in strong strokes and circles, and more fluid, diluted washes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eLisO7iCc8r04aIxIvsoaud6Zvq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topography","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3681423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chelsea Phillips-Carr","original_name":"Chelsea Phillips-Carr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630cf473226c56007bad124a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLisO7iCc8r04aIxIvsoaud6Zvq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
