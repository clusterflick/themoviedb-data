As Jin-goo's father suddenly leaves for England for a business trip, he stays in the same house with his stepmother, Ae-ran, who is still in an awkward relationship with him, but it is also uncomfortable to meet him at every meal. Ae-ran tries to take care of her son Jin-goo even if she's busy living every day as an English teacher and working part-time as a private tutor. She sometimes goes to work at night as if she had a part-time job. Meanwhile, Jin-goo often goes to karaoke rooms to meet Woo-mi, who is popular, thanks to the introduction of his senior in the neighborhood. One day, when that senior came home for a drink and encounters a huge fact, he turns around, revealing a huge secret and revealing their mixed erotic romance.","popularity":1.2136,"poster_path":"/3gXC21N8ZcXgiMHpN8bQ2N2bnBz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Job 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2632669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Min-jeong","original_name":"Yeon Hee","popularity":1.7781,"profile_path":"/zXnFDykPRdKpXIIrMPO2ZYgCyfp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ae-ran (애란)","credit_id":"66a746e7f9514fb73d8dc3ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2665418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Mi-na","original_name":"Lee Mi-na","popularity":0.2616,"profile_path":"/ovHlAkyCjWfBqqZBN9W45Oo8ndg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kimmy (김미)","credit_id":"630cedac724de1007b73375e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2708847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Seo","original_name":"Kang Seo","popularity":0.2427,"profile_path":"/tbL3ZXqKs4S13sC60EKkt86p8DP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jin-goo (진구)","credit_id":"630cedb8ede1b0007ed563c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1908003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Do-jin","original_name":"Park Do-jin","popularity":0.4957,"profile_path":"/c2HQYPz31QhJeUrNTg38N01dnw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Seong-woo (성우)","credit_id":"630cedbebbcae0007e4943fe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1907997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Min Do-yoon","original_name":"민도윤","popularity":6.4059,"profile_path":"/bHHn3krbHyxQIWb4JbHkPlV6Uu1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Student","credit_id":"630cedc2226c560092cb5697","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1908510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"No Hyun-jin","original_name":"No Hyun-jin","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630ced8cede1b00083c3c89c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1908510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"No Hyun-jin","original_name":"No Hyun-jin","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630ced7ed051d9007ec83f42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2579,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3gXC21N8ZcXgiMHpN8bQ2N2bnBz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155477,"name":"softcore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"19+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
