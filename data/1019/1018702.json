What began as human sacrifice during funeral rites for wealthy families resulted in a violent, bloody battle staged in front of 50,000 fans. Gladiators were slaves, but the archaeological remains at Pompeii and the Roman Colosseum reveal that they were held in the same esteem as modern day sports stars. Gladiators explains how this \"sport\" was used as a tool of political power and how the Gladiators rose up and waged war against their owners. Two versions are available: presenter-free, and presenter-led, with Terry Jones of Monty Python fame.","popularity":0.3887,"poster_path":"/z3Sgh4rAoulLYkzl7ECdq7lc2VT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gladiators: The Brutal Truth","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Denton","original_name":"Richard Denton","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/knoee6qM26P99ECamlCGYsaR3AG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"650fefaee1faed0100e8d65b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Jones","original_name":"Terry Jones","popularity":0.48,"profile_path":"/keJpqxK8gykrrK2W6yeSeDUbYDK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Host","credit_id":"66b2154c05289daf0ae25ea8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Ereira","original_name":"Alan Ereira","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650feedf6f53e10aa4c9ba62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5597566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/z3Sgh4rAoulLYkzl7ECdq7lc2VT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
