The precarious, war-driven landscape and the dreams of financial stability dissolve in the remains of the leisure culture from the past. A short film about the decommunization processes in the East of Ukraine. It reflects how the changes of monuments and regimes affect human beings in their everyday life. Until it finds the culmination of cultural and political borders in one product: the Soviet Champagne. The precarious, war-driven landscape of East-Ukraine and the dreams of financial stability dissolve in the remains of the leisure culture from the past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eElFpjqGWuAwIwf65zwk1GlwF1q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tears Will Remain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leri Matehha","original_name":"Leri Matehha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e6a87e7c097007e15606f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leri Matehha","original_name":"Leri Matehha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e6a9184591c0092d955ff","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanislav Menzelevskyi","original_name":"Stanislav Menzelevskyi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e6aa11dbc88007db570de","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2030077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadym Ilkov","original_name":"Вадим Ільков","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/8sPl5WnobKBveN9xbhnFie7vjqT.jpg","credit_id":"630e6aafa39d0b00923100a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21941420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eElFpjqGWuAwIwf65zwk1GlwF1q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hamburg Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Слезы останутся_excerpt.mp4","key":"673903536","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-05T12:53:57.000Z","id":"630e6ade7aecc6007a37f5e6"}]}}}
