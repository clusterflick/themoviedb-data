Despite a handful of their own original compositions, they filled halls and football stadiums with more than 10,000 visitors. The Ljubljana Exhibition and Convention Center and the Tivoli Hall were opened in Ljubljana. They laid the foundations of the Yugoslav music industry. The Kameleoni pulled back the Yugoslav Iron Curtain and helped the entire generation break free from the shackles of ideological and cultural post-war monumentalism.","popularity":0.0672,"poster_path":"/sgm9pUd3Xbk46NZZZgkbVS2THzs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":156935,"logo_path":"/1flX3ViePy3bIruKvBvTxBIcnOH.png","name":"Slovenski filmski center (SFC)","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":156121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kameleoni - The Beatles of Former Yugoslavia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3671700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomaž Domicelj","original_name":"Tomaž Domicelj","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"630e5ccde0ca7f007c1f57dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janez Bončina","original_name":"Janez Bončina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"630e5ceba39d0b009230fe1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Prpić","original_name":"Marko Prpić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"630e5cf45cea18007a00a616","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miha Čelar","original_name":"Miha Čelar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e5cc17aecc6007da468a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miha Čelar","original_name":"Miha Čelar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e5cbb7aecc6007a37f378","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36348546","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sgm9pUd3Xbk46NZZZgkbVS2THzs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
