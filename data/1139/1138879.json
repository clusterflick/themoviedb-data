At the same time as the two friends are in conversation the \"original\" Tom Kruse, outback mailman and the subject of Heyer's film, is retracing his journey of over 40 years before across the inland desert of Australia to bring the mail to the isolated people along the 325 mile stock-route from Queensland to South Australia. Heyer's importance to Austraian cinema is acknowledged and we get to see him as a person away from the camera too as he chats and travels across Europe with his friend.","popularity":0.0381,"poster_path":"/A9oEjUJ2jmztfcEx4QwGTeOSFIo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Forty years later","title":"Back to the Back of Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Heyer","original_name":"John Heyer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"John Heyer","credit_id":"6652f71bff812b6bf725ea28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117718,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Jackson","original_name":"Pat Jackson","popularity":0.0963,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pat Jackson","credit_id":"6652f74dbe4af0d690174f66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Kruse","original_name":"Tom Kruse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Kruse","credit_id":"6652f6a0606f75902b174254","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Francis","original_name":"Robert Francis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64856bd8e2726000afc2da6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Izzard","original_name":"John Izzard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64856c06d2b20900ad3cb4e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7309532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":811,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kLLu2RQMikP3N98e1gXuF664GNK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1442}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A9oEjUJ2jmztfcEx4QwGTeOSFIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
