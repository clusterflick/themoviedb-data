His father, Kumaran struggles to earn a living through the traditional chat and Pujas, far removed from his son's educational aspirations. The reservation system in India guarantees positions to historically disadvantaged groups.[3] When offered a position based on his poor background rather than his abilities, Viswanathan refuses. He struggles to rectify his own belief in his abilities with the seemingly meritless position offered; a struggle that worsens his feelings of inadequacy. The film explores the differences between the traditional work of the father and the educational job sought by the son, and merit-based advancement versus affirmative action.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chithariyavar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
