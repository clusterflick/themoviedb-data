Taking the stage in front of 60,000 fans, Ice-T and Body Count's set became one of the most talked about performances of SmokeOut 2003. Despite torrential rain and equipment problems, the band blazed through hits like 'KKK B***h' and 'End Game', exceeding their set time and setting off a chain of delays in true meteal tradition. Body Count's trademark brand of angry, gnash-your-teeth rap and metal had fans roaring, shouting for them to continue playing despite the stage crew's threats to shut them down. These threats were answered with Ice breaking into the hits 'There Goes the Neighborhood' and 'Cop Killer', further igniting a chorus of wild fans moshing and chanting every word.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tm5dmQpdrVnCkIeFLRBdmMNNJA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Count Featuring Ice-T: Smokeout Festival Presents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tm5dmQpdrVnCkIeFLRBdmMNNJA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
