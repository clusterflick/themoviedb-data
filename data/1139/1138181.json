One brief flash of the gymnasiums lights later, the resulting film functions as an abstract map of the location, a record of a performance, and an unusual meditation on the objecthood of film. The image, a vertical, negative shadow of the twines presence, unspools over time, with occasional bursts of sound that occur when the twine image slides over into the soundtrack area of the film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Photogrammetry Series","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Hock","original_name":"Louis Hock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648354dce375c0011c7f4057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
