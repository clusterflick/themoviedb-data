The medium is always at the service of a dark and brooding storytelling touched by flashes of humour.  This box set celebrating the talents of a master animator comprises all her classics: The Owl Who Married a Goose, The Street, The Metamorphosis of Mr. Samsa and Two Sisters, as well as Interview, made with Veronika Soul.  The DVD includes a student film, an animated video done for MTV, a comprehensive biofilmography and a brand-new director’s commentary on Two Sisters.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/aXyb7p4Lv6c3rSKSOMq0ZUK3Umf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"5 Films Directed by Caroline Leaf","title":"Caroline Leaf Out on a Limb, Handcrafted Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Leaf","original_name":"Caroline Leaf","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/lcQl4BSKtup40DVc6sdeR6EKcuo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"6487507bc0348b011fbe1cf6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Leaf","original_name":"Caroline Leaf","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/lcQl4BSKtup40DVc6sdeR6EKcuo.jpg","credit_id":"64874e65bf31f2505882b4a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cJbG6iNnGVlXLdov5017uKHcLPh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aXyb7p4Lv6c3rSKSOMq0ZUK3Umf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
