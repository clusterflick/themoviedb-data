This film is the first that I have completed which has a soundtrack wholly my own, composed of voices and natural sounds which I recorded, edited, and tape-altered myself. Besides that, my former use of lab-printed and in-camera superimposition to create complex images has been augmented by extensive optical printing. I was forced to build my own printer from surplus parts and to learn how to use it before I could make this film. Perhaps that is why it took so long.\" â€”John Luther","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Portrait of the Poet as James Broughton (Part One)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2513284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schofill","original_name":"John Schofill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6484b335e375c000c527aed4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
