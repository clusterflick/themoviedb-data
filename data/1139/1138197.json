I loved my family but not the cats. But one of our cats would wag her tail endlessly as long as her neck was stroked and, with the right music on the film's soundtrack, she really looked like she was  conducting the musicians. This idea became Catfilm for Ursula. The audience loved it, and I was awarded a carton of cat food for the film. â€”Standish Lawder","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catfilm for Ursula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Standish Lawder","original_name":"Standish Lawder","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/7utGj4rUfz6PsRLBHoyloNeGBzg.jpg","credit_id":"64836238e375c0011c7f4564","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
