Over the course of a decade, as Peter goes from weight-lifting dandy to his death from leukemia, Myra chronicles Peter’s complicated relationships with her and her family, and with his lovers, colleagues, and artists whose work he’s collected. When she urges him to launch an artists’ residency in his two adjacent homes with the art, rare books, and medical oddities he’s collected since his childhood, the film explores illness and mortality, love and betrayal, and the healing power of art.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventures in Peterland: A Mystery of Art and Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
