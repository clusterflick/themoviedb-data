The prison administration provides him with the name of the John Howard Societies if he does need assistance on the outside. He finds that once people know of his record, they won't give him a chance. And even if he doesn't mention his prison sentence, his criminal record eventually catches up with him. Even with the Societies taking on the task, getting a job for Brown is not easy and which will take great powers of persuasion. If no one is willing to give him a break, Brown may need to resort to his old ways and end up just another statistic sent back to prison.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1951-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Prison What?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronald Weyman","original_name":"Ronald Weyman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648318fcc9dbf9011dfb3d55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225032","wikidata_id":"Q2859037","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
