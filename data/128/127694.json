Created in the 1930s and 1940s by a crime-fighting grandmother, Frances Glessner Lee created the Nutshells to help homicide detectives hone their investigative skills. These surreal dollhouses reveal a dystopic and disturbing slice of domestic life with doll corpses representing actual murder victims, or perhaps something that just looks like murder. Despite all the advances in forensics, the Nutshells are still used today to train detectives. Documentary film, Of Dolls and Murder, explores the dioramas, the woman who created them, and their relationship to modern day forensics. From the iconic CSI television show to the Body Farm and criminally minded college students, legendary filmmaker and true crime aficionado, John Waters narrates the tiny world of big time murder.","popularity":0.0268,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Dolls and Murder","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Marks","original_name":"Susan Marks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b03c3a368484e172e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085541,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susan Marks","original_name":"Susan Marks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b03c3a368484e172e11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1588446","wikidata_id":"Q7078746","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
