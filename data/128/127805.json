Amid rare footage of the most shocking and inspired street acts from around the world, one performer after another pulls back the makeshift curtain. Their acts are astonishing; their stories, more amazing still. Here is the tightrope walker, the razor blade muncher, the sidewalk samurai, the tattooed man. Meet The Fireman who lost his teeth to his fire-eating act, and the Calypso Tumbler who's buying up real estate in the Caribbean. This is the human condition at its most freakishly wonderful.","popularity":0.4132,"poster_path":"/7MdTn7ofp8j0XpMyFPQBysYd5Xf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buskers; For Love or Money","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Amazing Johnathan","original_name":"The Amazing Johnathan","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b08c3a368484e174181","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Shields","original_name":"Robert Shields","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/giWnMAywC9V7oQHvsYx60e9XJgM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b08c3a368484e174185","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Rose","original_name":"Jim Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b08c3a368484e174189","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Moschen","original_name":"Michael Moschen","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b08c3a368484e17418d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Davis","original_name":"Michael Davis","popularity":0.2436,"profile_path":"/owO1mjlLAUKBog3o2zLoQXq2FJd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b08c3a368484e174191","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
