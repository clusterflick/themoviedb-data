Now you can share this uplifting story with your entire family.  The Apostles begins with a miracle. Peter, having been filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, heals a man who has been crippled since birth. The crowd that witnesses the miracle is amazed. But Peter reminds them that he performed this wondrous act for one reason only-to glorify Jesus' name.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Peter and the other Apostles are in great danger. The religious authorities see them as a serious threat. And many of them are, indeed, persecuted. At the same time, however, some of the persecutors are themselves converted. Among them is a man who will eventually become the most important Apostle of all.","popularity":0.1509,"poster_path":"/yyRU03MSujVzse4V1nqKV0wvMxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12313,"logo_path":"/1GUIuC1Pjk0oOWJuaS42zb9NF43.png","name":"GoodTimes Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After the death and resurrection of Jesus, His followers dedicate themselves to spreading His message throughout the land.","title":"Greatest Heroes and Legends of The Bible: The Apostles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William R.
