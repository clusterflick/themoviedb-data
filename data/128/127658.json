Under divine circumstances, they are given their wish. Dimension follows the tragic tale of Chance Pullman, and the way in which his own troubled past comes to affect and change the lives of those who come into contact with him. A reminder of how the littlest things often have the biggest consequences, Chance provides strangers and close friends with the opportunity to completely alter their life, but with one limitation: They can only change exactly three inches about themselves.","popularity":0.4857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rusted Rhino Production Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dimension","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Turner","original_name":"Paul Turner","popularity":0.1746,"profile_path":"/wVNUdAulsuztLm8o9O4Fsb4R6vm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chance Pullman","credit_id":"5f0efca50f21c6003808f051","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":191611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kay Cook","original_name":"Mary Kay Cook","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5f550cbf594c940035e4c869","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1753148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harlan Hogan","original_name":"Harlan Hogan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ivan","credit_id":"5f550ccb35039800358252c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":204271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deanna Dunagan","original_name":"Deanna Dunagan","popularity":0.392,"profile_path":"/cFjGlCpT8xA4HziBdohU42ddPoC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Annabelle","credit_id":"5f550cd584f2490036f8ebd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1372161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Laidlaw","original_name":"Elizabeth Laidlaw","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/fZkX9aCjjx8nqT08mZQKJ6ehsoN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Victoria","credit_id":"5f550cdd5c564e00341ac543","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550818,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marco Kyris","original_name":"Marco Kyris","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":"/aRrJ1pp47h4yLDa9gyllbeVmakV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marco","credit_id":"5f550cea713ed40034eef3ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike O'Connell","original_name":"Mike O'Connell","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/wEE0oR3VyuPrcxVn1wTPHtthuXN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"5f550d211511aa00351800fc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2524001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Delgado","original_name":"Sandra Delgado","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/5goX3wXz3NNt1pBQND9ObW92SAq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Santos","credit_id":"5f550d2a8390180035b76091","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1446876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Clement","original_name":"Judy Clement","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/t6djO4XbqUEylnIvtC3nZ1TwKzX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chance's wife","credit_id":"5f550d33350398003481e042","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Rivera","original_name":"Dale Rivera","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/wVwh9rYwvSNSMjuFGko5ag7PkSI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Handsome Train Man","credit_id":"5f550d3c713ed40034eef45c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Kwan Peterson","original_name":"Lucas Kwan Peterson","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Altersing","credit_id":"5f550d46a589020035e31829","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiernan Shipka","original_name":"Kiernan Shipka","popularity":3.7045,"profile_path":"/t2FWVLTIhVRIa398mQAfN4thO5R.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"5f550d4ff5f1c5003788a9c4","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Turner","original_name":"Casey Turner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"5f550d59713ed40034eef4cd","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Scott Harris","original_name":"Matthew Scott Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554fd7959251416d290000b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0473351","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
