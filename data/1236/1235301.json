Peter is a teenager, who has grown up in this suffocating environment with his strict grandmother and overprotective mother, who have forced him to wear a protective mask over his eyes since the day he was born. Peter suffers from an “eye disease” and he is gradually losing his sight. Before he becomes completely blind, he and his best friend Aemon will travel away from home and go to the place they desire the most: to see the view up from the top of the recently built wind turbines. Through their adventures, Peter will come-of-age, and learn the painful truth about his eye condition and the lies he has been told. He will understand that to complete his journey he must sacrifice his own eyes.","popularity":0.311,"poster_path":"/6EjC810NKAweKj1AcsbytPok6Wc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152983,"logo_path":"/kWQtEKt9OOdtIRerChq3mKpBOUF.png","name":"Willa","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3916,"logo_path":"/noNtRpiSEx5XUfhWbhr74MiXXn9.png","name":"Cold
