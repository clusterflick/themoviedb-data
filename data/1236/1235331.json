As indicated by the title of this documentary, he has become a living legend viewed contrastively as hero or dictator. Although the recent history of Cuba plays a role in this work, this documentary instead focuses on the individual as it recounts the life and times of Fidel Castro from childhood through the present day. Castro: Man and Myth is based on the book Fidel Castro, a Biography (2004) by Volker Skierka, originally published in German in 2001 using resources not previously accessible, such as those in the former German Democratic Republicâ€™s archives on Cuba. Skierka also co-directed and co-produced this documentary.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Castro: Man and Myth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1797983,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephan Lamby","original_name":"Stephan Lamby","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b05a1b158c85010aa12c99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3484744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Skierka","original_name":"Volker Skierka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b05ad067b613010c610b92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
