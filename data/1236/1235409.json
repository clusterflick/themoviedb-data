From birth, doctors warn that his life will be overshadowed by limitations. Ben yearns for an ordinary life free from the harsh scrutiny he faces daily.  However, each experience of adversity, including relentless bullying and a series of painful surgeries, ignites a fire within him. Wrestling becomes his proving ground, a place where he learns to transform his facial difference into a source of power. Determined to succeed, he pushes himself relentlessly, breaking through physical, social, and even romantic barriers that once seemed insurmountable. But as unexpected challenges arise and ridicule resurfaces, Ben finds himself at a defining crossroads: fade into the background of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life, or fully embrace his unique path and boldly stand out.","popularity":1.2225,"poster_path":"/zNeKKRbZRhgxi5Gpu4SWLhmBEH0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Remember Films","origin_country":""},{"id":69439,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Visual Transit Authority","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"With no chance at an ordinary life, he lived an extraordinary one.","title":"Standout: The Ben Kjar Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4498200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Kjar","original_name":"Ben Kjar","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/hc9Lb5b5HYVemSvGnIrPqxfH8d6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b17bcab9a0bd0193453f0d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5128022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LaCol Grant","original_name":"LaCol Grant","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676338dfa0cc3de647fffe2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Robles","original_name":"Anthony Robles","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/iujAPfLbWOy4StQVuRmJg83Bfyh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6763392c713e9ff45bab0f72","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5128026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colton Fielding","original_name":"Colton Fielding","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Young Ben","credit_id":"6763393c55cd2dec98fff976","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":576250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Wadley","original_name":"Emily Wadley","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Young Stana","credit_id":"678a9be029071c36ac977ee8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5185988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stana Kjar","original_name":"Stana Kjar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678a9bf71403701c991d8602","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5185989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Kjar","original_name":"Scott Kjar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"678a9c0294d95839f3ad6d5e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5185992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parker D.
