The difficulty of watching the two sides at once deconstructs the idea that there is a single point of view of both camera and projection, and invites viewers to reconsider how their own bodies interact with the films they watch. A response to José Val del Omar's inquiries into a potential \"other cinema\" that exists in the intervals between frames, Trágame nube approaches the phenomenon of \"persistence of vision\" in combination with what Val del Omar called espejo aprojimante, both a technique in which film is projected onto a mirror to diffract images and a reference to cinema as a system that proposes awareness of a shared corporeality among its viewers.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/qiHyfSwvAkPPkhiLb5WExfjtsh1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trágame nube (el cuerpo establece el ritmo)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4498227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esperanza Collado","original_name":"Esperanza Collado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b17fa0ea37e00193e4a7f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qiHyfSwvAkPPkhiLb5WExfjtsh1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
