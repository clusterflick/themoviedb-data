The bike club spends their time hanging out at a tiny little motel with a 1950's neon sign, the Sky Lit Motel, and a bar where dancers ply their trade for the club members, known as Bourbon Street. Shooter and Whitley was shot without a script, as the lives of the club members play out against the back drop of a Midwestern city bereft of opportunities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5k88cZCtyjZek6FooS6eSYIAaGx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooter and Whitley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Aronson","original_name":"Jeffrey Aronson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Shooter","credit_id":"65af5a0d67b61300aff073cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitley Fuss","original_name":"Whitley Fuss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Whitley","credit_id":"65af5a20d100b600cb8170b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Lantz","original_name":"Edward Lantz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"65af5a3b39756100ec20fff8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Vicenzi","original_name":"Lisa Vicenzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Speedy","credit_id":"65af5a4a158c8500cb2f9ee1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura A.
