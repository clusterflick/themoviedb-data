The pandemic caused them to cancel the wedding, and forced them into lockdown with Luke’s mum, Karen, who had travelled all the way from Australia. Luke filmed it all and put it online as a series. They cancelled their wedding again when Maria fell pregnant. Luke filmed that too. Maria is now determined to get married. Luke, feeling stuck in Spain, thinks the only way to enjoy the wedding and cling to his old dreams is to film it. For Maria, sick of their life being public, it’s the final straw.","popularity":0.4056,"poster_path":"/jaI0ACpO8ylyp86uX4VbD7c3ohM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221210,"logo_path":null,"name":"More Sauce Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":227369,"logo_path":null,"name":"EOC Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"New normal.
