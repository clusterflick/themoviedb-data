Film will be viewed through the eyes of a passionate fisherman, fishing tourism entrepreneur, reindeer herder and children’s perspective who have only lived in the era of warming. Film will compare 50–100 years old film and picture footage with modern footage taken from the same places as the old footage. This will show the speed of the change in the arctic nature to viewers in a concrete way, and the footage will be commented on by old people who have lived through this period of time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Past and the Future of the Arctic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Pieski","original_name":"Hans Pieski","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b23db9ab1bc70164a8b172","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
