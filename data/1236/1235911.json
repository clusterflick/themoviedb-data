First he picks up two old acquaintances to go on a drinking spree through pubs and bars. The good old days of carefree life in the past are to be brought back to life for one more night. The handicap: the guy is broke. His friends generously step in. Already slightly drunk, our \"hero\" meets a relative whom he wants to hit up for money, but is knocked out by him in the pub's toilet. The broken lip was worth it in the end. He is a thousand marks richer. Enough to continue his drinking spree, but also enough to use the money to seek his fortune in the land of opportunity. His friends' reservations about the spontaneous venture are swept aside without further thought. Why worry? Happiness lies in the street, maybe I'll make the big bucks and (or) fall in love. At the end of the movie, we see him where we expected him to be: Munich-Riem Airport.","popularity":0.3083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verlieben vielleicht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Emmerich","original_name":"Roland Emmerich","popularity":1.0133,"profile_path":"/mN8x74uv9yQ7dJl8nh2q26mkY8v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"65b251090f2fbd0163670de6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4499331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David von Richthofen","original_name":"David von Richthofen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"65b2510fab1bc70185a8f7d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Jantschek","original_name":"Horst Jantschek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"65b2511a2866fa0162e3af98","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28370,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Egon Werdin","original_name":"Egon Werdin","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b251336eecee0162347556","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gabriele M.
