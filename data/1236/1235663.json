A black lava rock islet was once a shamanic shrine for the wind goddess Yeongdeung Halmang. In Kaisen’s poignant visual imagery, the women’s hands meticulously fold and connect sochang — long white cotton pieces of cloth symbolising the spiral movement of spirituality and the cycle of life and death. As the video unfolds, the sochang winds around the islet like a parting embrace.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/eZ6bUd0JKHhSiRvxlsOFSNuJ8Eb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halmang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Jin Kaisen","original_name":"Jane Jin Kaisen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b172802790bf01725660b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eZ6bUd0JKHhSiRvxlsOFSNuJ8Eb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
