At a crossroads not far from the frontline, three boys in fatigues, with wooden guns, act out a grown-up duty: to uncover Russian spies. The drivers, both soldiers and civilians, are cheered by the children’s playful solidarity. Cars are flagged down, IDs requested, trunks inspected. A password is demanded: “Palyanitsya”, the name of a traditional Ukrainian bread, and a word that Russians can’t pronounce right. As it happens, bread also is the universal symbol of life.","popularity":0.1251,"poster_path":"/fAAiiAdxFrTGHYRwNRl7B9B0dPn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #39: Parol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af5ac625cd8500cb4ee96c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af5ab439756100cb229a93","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af5aa8d100b600cb8170e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"65af5ad825cd85010a6f06ba","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495266,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanna Tsyba","original_name":"Hanna Tsyba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af5af83e2ec8010b05b018","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fAAiiAdxFrTGHYRwNRl7B9B0dPn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
