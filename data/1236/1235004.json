Girl and boy pile up candy wrappers, face down; elsewhere, for the game is widespread, it could be cards, tokens, any flimsy object with a front and a back. A lightning round of scissors-paper-rock decides who slaps first. The aim is to make the colourful, ‘right’ sides appear, and these wrappers can be claimed, yet are soon back in play. The siblings have identical profiles, and sometimes positions, like one person playing in a mirror. When the door opens and the someone appears, they rush off into their day.","popularity":0.1289,"poster_path":"/paHbiAiOJ5qRvIkUl0cizTchZhW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2023-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #38: Ellsakat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af589971ffdf00eb75c9a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Boccara","original_name":"Ivan Boccara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af58adf8aee800cbb0fbde","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65af58bcd100b6010c82e321","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"65af58cc6af8f8010c9733e3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/paHbiAiOJ5qRvIkUl0cizTchZhW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
