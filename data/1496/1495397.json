This Ashram is a unique example, in the modern world where an artist lacks free space to practice art. The artists gather here to celebrate music and the silence of nature uninterruptedly. In ashram rain arrives, seasons change, and stillness of the time persists. But today man's greed tries to destroy the river and the surroundings, pains the land and the artist.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sSSnYmBYQQe7nEHGhc1ZFW6GoY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114295,"logo_path":"/kjCGKKIPoh88O3KwcdrmjrUI0sX.png","name":"Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debjani Banerjee","original_name":"Debjani Banerjee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684721d98d1f28663e3fcc4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5117820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debjani Banerjee","original_name":"Debjani Banerjee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684721e2d669235de0bb3217","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2921083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Subal K R","original_name":"Subal K R","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684721f92712534a241ea9fc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2921083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Subal K R","original_name":"Subal K R","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6847220a24c39ef4e51ead12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5494662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dibakar Saha","original_name":"Dibakar Saha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68472225eaf5ae76c4301b38","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3796256,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Archisman Mukherjee","original_name":"Archisman Mukherjee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684722c58458a830ea301cf7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507910,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kenneth Cyrus","original_name":"Kenneth Cyrus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684722e621ccec3aa534296e","department":"Crew","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2921083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Subal K R","original_name":"Subal K R","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684722fdf79f768d0efd60b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"bn","file_path":"/sSSnYmBYQQe7nEHGhc1ZFW6GoY3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222180,"name":"west bengal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
