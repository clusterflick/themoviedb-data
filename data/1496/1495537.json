Why, you ask? To quote the temperamental yet ultimately quite sensitive gangster Harry De Bauld, a character you will grow to love as much as we do - “well, it’s...it’s kinda personal.” Okay it’s not actually personal at all, it’s just that the movie is really, really funny. It trades most of the sleaze, grime, and, well, exploitation that you expect from the genre for dopiness, sexual situations that fail to lead to actual sex, a clumsy confused sweetness, and more botched lines per minute than anything we’ve ever seen.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax: The Guy From Harlem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30022,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Murphy","original_name":"Kevin Murphy","popularity":0.3812,"profile_path":"/s1REGBYFGc2Ibo7QlQ95cbjaq2m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"684757980ee7e0b662342a8f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael J.
