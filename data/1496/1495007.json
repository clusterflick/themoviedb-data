Based on the piano composition written and performed by John Barham, a trailing dot appears and fades as each note is stuck. The dots interact in fluid sequences in harmony with the music. The Marwa raga is an evening melody, characterized by melancholy and pathos, combined with a longing and passion that makes it a highly emotive sound-scape. John Barham is a British musician well known for his work in interpreting Indian music for western instruments and worked with Ravi Shankar, George Harrison and many other musicians.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raga Marwa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5419134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Osborne","original_name":"John Osborne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684640acc1b88572852063a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2147096","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
