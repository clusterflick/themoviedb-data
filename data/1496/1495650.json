His successful  partnership with his college friend Bruce has left him feeling as though he can no longer  find the art in his creative practice. But downsizing to his own firm proves more difficult  than expected and when he realizes he has to sell his house in order to survive, his  girlfriend leaves him. With nothing left to hold him in the city, he decides to move out to  his cousinâ€™s farm and spend the winter in Saskatchewan. At first his plan is to build a  cabin and winter like his mentor Henry Thoreau, but the weather soon overwhelms him.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Field Sketches","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Rose","original_name":"Gabrielle Rose","popularity":1.4551,"profile_path":"/obWfgaR4YBk648USvpLrJC64DVU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"6847b66c3f83a7a421bb357a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Bessai","original_name":"Carl Bessai","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/cWfxXaLCc4pNNBFj3h2B9V6lh97.jpg","credit_id":"6847b695789ef510931eae32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Bessai","original_name":"Carl Bessai","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/cWfxXaLCc4pNNBFj3h2B9V6lh97.jpg","credit_id":"6847b69e98d4b1b8f3342d1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Bessai","original_name":"Carl Bessai","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/cWfxXaLCc4pNNBFj3h2B9V6lh97.jpg","credit_id":"6847b6abb2c4b2a3ca2934fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Bessai","original_name":"Carl Bessai","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/cWfxXaLCc4pNNBFj3h2B9V6lh97.jpg","credit_id":"6847b6b04c96d90b89343053","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30028316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vancouver Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
