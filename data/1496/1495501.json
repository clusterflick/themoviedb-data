He receives a mysterious invitation to the Cheshire Cat Hotel and takes a week off in order to go check it out. The hotel is a lively if somewhat strange place with curious staff members, and at first Ernest is wary about staying. The hotel manager eventually persuades him, though, offering Ernest free services if he does a favor for another patron. They want him to help break up the engagement of a certain couple, Mary and Charles.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hzWtXoWm52AgaG6P0MjJK3AkGrV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invitation from Alice -Welcome to the Cheshire Cat Hotel-","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takane Fubuki","original_name":"高嶺ふぶき","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/5Wdc4wU6eMyfKhl5lxilc1qI2ej.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ernest / Jack","credit_id":"684747acc21f99667d9103da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4994964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kisaki Miri","original_name":"Kisaki Miri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"684747b4175a517eb5de71ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1833692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wao Youka","original_name":"和央ようか","popularity":0.1467,"profile_path":"/5Yo3cyQSUz3pgYk1amgmep3v3JY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"684747bc80ad30119629323c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayabuki Mao","original_name":"彩吹真央","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":"/vURP7V1EwlZzS0br2CnQyhG6m70.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"684747cf4cff3224bc1eabe1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4994963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oota Tetsunori","original_name":"Oota Tetsunori","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684747db5aa37572d429339c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hzWtXoWm52AgaG6P0MjJK3AkGrV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1996-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
