Hayden did not struggle with depression nor did he have a history of mental health problems. He was a normal healthy and happy kid who was unprepared for social isolation. His parents attribute Hayden’s emotional suffering to a “perfect storm of routine disruption, social isolation, increased gaming, and a pressure stack of activity cancellations,” all created by the government’s mandated stay-at-home orders in the wake of the COVID-19 global pandemic.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/qtyZHQfHl35Q1qIPexR3ZHEfXrN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aledo Film
