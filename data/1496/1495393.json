Like a bad grain of rice, the promise has withered away, left inside a container of pledges—unopened and unfulfilled. A questionable small move was made by the administration, an effort to justify a blinding promise. The 20 pesos/kilo implementation promise doesn’t only hurt Filipino consumers but also farmers. While the price of rice per kilogram is skyrocketing, the farmgate price remains painfully low. It is a cycle in every election, leading the Filipino people to believe in false and empty promises, only to be hindered by nature and human neglect. When will this cycle end? Who knows.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9kky0WvOOiZaqztqSuDYypS8joB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ang Saad nga Bugas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5494649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikone Joshua Calungsod","original_name":"Mikone Joshua Calungsod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68472118e9889dc33320676d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9kky0WvOOiZaqztqSuDYypS8joB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
