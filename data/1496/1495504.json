A sponsor of the Imperial Symphony, Lord Kuretake Kimiya, is deathly ill. He calls to his bedside Sanjou Kaoru, who is both the fiancé of his daughter Umeko and an up-and-coming conductor. Lord Kuretake has a very serious request: Many years ago, he had a daughter with a Russian woman and he begs Sanjou to search for her in Shanghai. Because her mother, Anastasia, an opera singer, was a close friend of the princess, when the revolution came, she vanished with the imperial family. Since then, Kuretake has married and had a family, and he wants his daughter Natasha to be raised in his home.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yZGP58HASFWj6o7ikrDntEaSVdz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natasha of the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4022116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takane Fubuki","original_name":"高嶺ふぶき","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/5Wdc4wU6eMyfKhl5lxilc1qI2ej.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sanjou Kaoru","credit_id":"6847495ad88b3daaff9f5190","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1833693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari Hanafusa","original_name":"花總まり","popularity":0.4037,"profile_path":"/rYFAfAl7OobcDyItHaex7mfgOpZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ranko/Natasha","credit_id":"68474963b6a9aac54e1eaaf1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3935686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todoroki Yuu","original_name":"轟悠","popularity":0.2861,"profile_path":"/5QLnrnME5n6jIvd4gQfUPw38TLX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kurisaki Takeshi","credit_id":"68474970d3c8daa0aa9f517e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1833692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wao Youka","original_name":"和央ようか","popularity":0.1467,"profile_path":"/5Yo3cyQSUz3pgYk1amgmep3v3JY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nagaoka Hitoshi","credit_id":"6847497e3a8b229c57bb3430","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3136192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shinji Ueda","original_name":"植田紳爾","popularity":0.3722,"profile_path":"/iI86InQ1rtRZcKNfRGxBV2WGbPU.jpg","credit_id":"6847498f3a8b229c57bb3433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tdW8Ezs3D70oAUpauWVUjWJQoO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZGP58HASFWj6o7ikrDntEaSVdz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
