Starring the talented Japanese actress Mika Shirahama as Chisato Tateyama, the film masterfully intertwines her journey into a mysterious forest with a chilling encounter with the legendary Nekomata yokai – a supernatural cat creature from Japanese mythology.  Drawing profound inspiration from the atmospheric dread of 1960s Japanese horror classics like Kaneto Shindo's \"Onibaba\" and \"Kuroneko,\" \"Nekomata\" crafts a spellbinding narrative of supernatural intrigue and spine-chilling suspense. As Chisato ventures deeper into the ancient woods, she unearths a terrifying truth rooted in the forest's supernatural inhabitants, delivering a hauntingly immersive experience that pays homage to its cinematic predecessors while forging its own path into terror.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oilplPcrdXfG22KId44AyIHVjfB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":264845,"logo_path":null,"name":"NEO-WORLD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nekomata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"猫又","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5496090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mika Shirahama","original_name":"Mika Shirahama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Chisato Tateyama","credit_id":"684820d017f2287284301f76","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5496091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Asadi","original_name":"Oliver Asadi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684820e2046760db8a9f5459","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5496091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Asadi","original_name":"Oliver Asadi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684822b198d4b1b8f3342f00","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28640307","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9zm6yqkRDrLC7fmoG6KAyu5CcTW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oilplPcrdXfG22KId44AyIHVjfB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1350}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
