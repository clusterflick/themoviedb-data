Beginning as two punk bands in Indiana and Florida, a professor and student bond over Elvis Presley and decide to send cassettes via the mail to create music that \"Buddy Holly would be Proud of.\" Critics made claims like, \"The most underrated musicians in the country,\" and proclaimed, \"The best album in the last 10 years.\" They described their music as \"a cross between an Andrew Wyeth painting and a Robert Frost Poem.\" The Vulgar Boatmen were the critic's darlings who had a loyal cult following. They received stellar reviews, did cross country tours, European TV, and created seamless pop music yet success in the market place eluded them. This may be the story of a thousand bands but this one is personal. In Drive Somewhere a fan documents the band as they drive to their final gig of their 30 year career.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drive Somewhere - The Saga of the Vulgar Boatmen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Uhter","original_name":"Fred Uhter","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6847260c38f4780fae301bd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5494913,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dan Christmas","original_name":"Dan Christmas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6847425acdece4fe2c3fcad1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1662688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
