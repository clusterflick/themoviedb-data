By using the dispositif of miniDV, the film preserves glimpses of beauty and melancholy of finitude, reflected in fading and almost violent light. As a result, this silent construction of light and shadow—abstract and concrete at the same time—brings us to another realm, proposing the projection of pure impressions and fleeting moments, helping us to feel what the waning really is.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jV1kWrERREotCHty3m32yzlyATK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2871947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Kostrov","original_name":"Vadim Kostrov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/yz8dlX3NXhGFYdqCiV43HwFgubi.jpg","credit_id":"684775423b2f6815f9de7554","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1741,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jV1kWrERREotCHty3m32yzlyATK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1174}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
