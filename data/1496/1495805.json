Using a fist and an open palm, actor Edward Judd (in the tight roll-neck jumper that was a symbol of no-nonsense masculinity in the late 1970s), demonstrates the impact of a collision between a car and a motorbike at a junction. Some alarmingly convincing simulated crash footage helps hammer in the message.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9L88OYgTjZ5pnpEw3VND4R7Euty.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8598,"logo_path":"/pFhDa84YifM8WUjeoBw3hkl2fRC.png","name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Think once... think twice... think bike!","title":"Think Bike - Edward Judd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Judd","original_name":"Edward Judd","popularity":0.6509,"profile_path":"/4M5aLZ3U3KPnVAPWnvlmA1eiQD8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6848253f2712534a241eadf2","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9L88OYgTjZ5pnpEw3VND4R7Euty.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
