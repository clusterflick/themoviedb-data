Unable to face everyone and with nowhere else to turn, she decides to just go anyway. While at a rest stop along the way, she meets Allison, who's boyfriend just abandoned her after an argument. Since they're both headed in the same direction, Casey offers her a ride and an unlikely friendship begins to form.
