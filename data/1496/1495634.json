Called to the scene of the ritualistic murder of a young woman, newly appointed police commissioner Teddy Roosevelt discovers Detective Wayne and his police officers power usurped by two special investigators appointed by the White House: Occultist Edgar Allan Poe, a clockwork automaton housing the soul of the literary legend, and Mrs. Emma Entwistle, a dangerous assassin with a unique connection to the otherworld. When they illicit information from the demon Neshrew, a much darker and more dangerous plot of world domination is uncovered.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2lcofvgVz65Om7iSjchFlmjuDjr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2762,"logo_path":"/leWVtGmp0pyr9pGOAz7WgZj2FjA.png","name":"Highland Myst Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":112676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wolfclan Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mechanical Grave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5495541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Leigh","original_name":"Nicole Leigh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Emma Louise Entwistle","credit_id":"6847abfc0ee7e0b662342beb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan R.
