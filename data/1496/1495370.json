However, he has higher artistic aspirations that conflict with the trajectory of his career. When renowned period and art film director, Thomas Dockery, contacts him to play the lead in an upcoming film, Matthew sees an opportunity to redirect his career. He accepts Dockery's invitation to visit his country estate ahead of the start of production. Over the course of the week Matthew comes to find that he and Dockery are more alike then he expected. Inexplicably, they find companionship based on a subtle mutual acknowledgment of each other's existential predicament of isolation and alienation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gXST1w5XfuEZdaW6f3lT4onmQtJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Latent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2402029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cooper Koch","original_name":"Cooper Koch","popularity":1.9764,"profile_path":"/vcNDm1EBBmrGSi2yPA82pGEeGdG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Matthew","credit_id":"68471abb51161372533fcb09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3252603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Godfrey J.
