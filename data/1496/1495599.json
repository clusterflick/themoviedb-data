This Vice documentary meets them as they prepare to tour Europe, and take the metal world by storm. The quiet lives of the members — Lewis de Jong and Ethan Trembath attend different high schools, while Henry de Jong is an apprentice mechanic — are contrasted with a high intensity performance (at the Auckland release show for the band's debut album Tū). The de Jong parents share stories about their two sons, and the band travel to Lake Rotoiti, to reconnect with their whakapapa.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":200381,"logo_path":"/1OAjprr0LoAWXC5WS6favtDTohg.png","name":"VICE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2018-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alien Weaponry - Thrash Metal and Te Reo Māori","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5495432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Trembath","original_name":"Ethan Trembath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"684784f3f9743db94b3fcbed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182874,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tim Flower","original_name":"Tim Flower","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68478441eaf5ae76c4301c7e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Benger","original_name":"David Benger","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6847846469c9feb7829f5244","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kent Belcher","original_name":"Kent Belcher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6847849fd994f1918f9f5282","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260068,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josh Yong","original_name":"Josh Yong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684784d88b5d3f30e1bb3545","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":288351,"name":"metal music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.vice.com/en/article/watch-alien-weaponrys-thrash-metal-karakia-to-the-world/","release_date":"2018-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
