Suddenly two men on motorbikes (Will Helm and Kriss Aston) knock Jonathan down as they race by him. The men take Jonathan back to their refuge and explain the forsaken town. Five days prior they were given a final news cast. The anchorman read out the horrific news that the world would come to an end. \"It is time to be with family, friends and loved ones. These are our last days.\" Since then all signals, cell phones, everything has been cut off. The two men have chosen to stay as everyone else fled to island. The men now have no choice but to live as if there is no tomorrow and fulfill their fantasies before sunset.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mcwgEjwxgbGX6N7X2UUECrXIyye.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mcwgEjwxgbGX6N7X2UUECrXIyye.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
