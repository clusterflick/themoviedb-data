The immigrants were despised by the local population who feared their 'invasion'. While many embraced the Israeli lifestyle, others chose to live in self-made Russian ghettos. These ghettos were a fertile ground for the creation of self-hating Jewish skinheads. 'White Panther' is the story of Alex, a young Russian immigrant who joins a skinheads' gang, led by his older brother. An unexpected meeting with David, a religious Moroccan Jew, gives Alex a chance to pursue his longtime dream of becoming a boxer like his father. Alex finds himself torn between his two father figures - his violent older brother and his new Jewish trainer, only to find out the truth about those he so admires.","popularity":0.0518,"poster_path":"/hFdpp3xfMe3MyFWd1QFankL90Vt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Panther","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Panter Lavan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeny Orlov","original_name":"Yevgeny Orlov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alex Zeitlin","credit_id":"574e0c3f92514172ff000112","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ze'ev Revach","original_name":"Ze'ev Revach","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/stN60HiMmDwcwCykEVfFDyS82Gy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David Ohana","credit_id":"574e0c4bc3a368578e000118","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1400692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meytal Gal","original_name":"Meytal Gal","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/cvM60FtWxeCGK7hXh8aDVp6HGu6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yasmin Ohana","credit_id":"574e0c62c3a368577f00019e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Manor","original_name":"Natasha Manor","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vera Zeitlin","credit_id":"574e0c6f92514172f9000109","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629117,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danni Reisfeld","original_name":"Danni Reisfeld","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574e0c25c3a368637f000025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629117,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Danni Reisfeld","original_name":"Danni Reisfeld","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"574e0c2b92514172f600011f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amir Golan","original_name":"Amir Golan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6ab4d333ad8f00133a6a71","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564477,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Behar","original_name":"Guy Behar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6ab4ca2f3b170017406c93","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Avitzur","original_name":"Daniel Avitzur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6ab4c055c926001766c745","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564475,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alon Ohana","original_name":"Alon Ohana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6ab4b32f3b170017406c7d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667897,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ram Shweky","original_name":"Ram Shweky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6ab4ba55c9260019668b53","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2614342","wikidata_id":"Q52835974","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFdpp3xfMe3MyFWd1QFankL90Vt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
