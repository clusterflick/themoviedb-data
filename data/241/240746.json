In this film, she reminisces about her family life beginning when she was about five years old, up to the present when she is in her early 20s. Of her two sisters, one has a nervous breakdown and the other one becomes something of a baby factory. Colorful anecdotes of her eventful life lend additional depth to her insights.","popularity":0.3921,"poster_path":"/i4VKAevKXVoNiMD88EM8M1gkml5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albina Productions S.a.r.l.","origin_country":""},{"id":22123,"logo_path":"/zPTy6QDAlCKGeAALZoFEL3QAlut.png","name":"TF1","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart to Heart","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Caudry","original_name":"Anne Caudry","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/yHf2C6ucJ4ZChJaWKVCMmg33mTR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brigitte","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Jacquinot","original_name":"Carole Jacquinot","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/cXHu7b0QltSj6W8d1aAMTZJubj1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pierrette","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Servier","original_name":"Elisa Servier","popularity":0.2152,"profile_path":"/oluStLMFiw4cE9hR19mZlJRyY6f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Florence","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Crémieux","original_name":"Henri Crémieux","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/3rXhrBS967lMOJQHUqOIYa1P134.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"le grand-père Roussel","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04bd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1132048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louba Guertchikoff","original_name":"Louba Guertchikoff","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/urz2qqGYYsatyFBDTc0BbADTfF9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"la grand-mère Roussel","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04c1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","original_name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":"/7jp7HehQgxpG8GknoKIIBrZIxow.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Emile Roussel, le père","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04c5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Galabru","original_name":"Michel Galabru","popularity":0.3315,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"le cousin Gabriel","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04c9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":548819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Lignières","original_name":"Laurence Lignières","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Madame Roussel, la mère","credit_id":"52fe4eabc3a36847f82a04cd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Lafaurie","original_name":"Igor Lafaurie","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"François","credit_id":"651a7e52223a8b00c45afd5e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques François","original_name":"Jacques François","popularity":0.244,"profile_path":"/gEE5ItVCtnRkshyAtgdF02xVeVy.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"M.
