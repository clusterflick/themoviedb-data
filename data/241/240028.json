Drawing from her emotional experiences, she illustrates what it feels like to be “in the middle.” Employing rotoscopy, hand-drawn animation techniques and subtle stereoscopic 3D, the film captures Petra as she engages the camera with unflinching directness and dignity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/22603KkFCEMGjkDPVuHWA4lWIbE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petra's Poem","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shira Avni","original_name":"Shira Avni","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554c6c19c3a3685e4e003fd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2635812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1201,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22603KkFCEMGjkDPVuHWA4lWIbE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
