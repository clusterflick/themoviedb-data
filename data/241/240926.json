The story takes place during a wedding in the Dalmatian inland in Croatia. Ante marries a much younger woman, Višnja; the groom's godfather is Andrija, the partisan war hero born in this very village, and a member of the new Communist political establishment. Two members of the Yugoslav State Security crash the traditional wedding ceremony. In the growing atmosphere of fear nobody knows who will be arrested.","popularity":0.5617,"poster_path":"/311Cs4YR30Sy4grV36ub7MVrPMR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168,"logo_path":"/AmNSNdDaByDpc0bzekWFeYRXDW2.png","name":"Jadran
