Because of the close ties between the two men everything should go smoothly, but the pressures within the two families are such that the wedding negotiations over the bridewealth become increasingly tense.  Arranging the number and type of animals to be given as bridewealth demands an intricate balance between psychology and economics: Kongu must offer enough animals to please Lorang and his relatives, but not so many that he appears weak or foolish, or depletes his own family's herds.  Negotiations drag on for several days, then threaten to break down altogether. The outcome depends not only on traditional patterns of behavior, but also on the influence exerted by Lorang's wives and the manner in which Lorang chooses to resolve the dilemma that confronts him.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/ufH3RtHydMHwsnrgD4TuK9rMrmX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wedding Camels","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith MacDougall","original_name":"Judith MacDougall","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56165894c3a36818a1007885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David MacDougall","original_name":"David MacDougall","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/u6ymKda5rQcMhf93hAx7P64kDDq.jpg","credit_id":"5616588792514129af0019a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith MacDougall","original_name":"Judith MacDougall","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c488375c3a368576a8803e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David MacDougall","original_name":"David MacDougall","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/u6ymKda5rQcMhf93hAx7P64kDDq.jpg","credit_id":"5c48836e0e0a26494dcc53c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1774636","wikidata_id":"Q23020593","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f6eKESV0JOluzpszUS1RoQrMkqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ufH3RtHydMHwsnrgD4TuK9rMrmX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
