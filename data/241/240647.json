While this happens, her husband feels disgraced that Diarrha resists the idea of marrying off their daughter, so he exactes his revenge by spreading a dangerous rumor that would probably get her killed. Because of this, Diarrha's fate falls into the village elder's hands. When she finds out she will go trial, she decides to flee to the nearest town, Ouagadougou, before that can take place. After successfully leaving her village, Diarrha's age causes her health to decline, while her daughter grows up. Some time later, her daughter decides to travel to Ouagadougou, in search of her missing mother. Once they are reconnected, they attempt to escape from their male-dominated society.","popularity":0.2218,"poster_path":"/wCzTQ7RldwmBBeVBOqt70XiERPq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88969,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dunia Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":88970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Espoir","origin_country":"BF"},{"id":8472,"logo_path":"/1W54BW7b0KZW0QoU55OPr9Sjde5.png","name":"Thelma Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2005-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delwende","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Delwende, lève-toi et marche","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blandine Yaméogo","original_name":"Blandine Yaméogo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Napoko","credit_id":"598baed292514107b80023ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Ilboudo","original_name":"Claire Ilboudo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pougbila","credit_id":"598baedd92514108010023e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Célestin Zongo","original_name":"Célestin Zongo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Diarra","credit_id":"598baee992514108010023f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdoulaye Komboudri","original_name":"Abdoulaye Komboudri","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nonceur","credit_id":"598baef792514108150024c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Kaboré","original_name":"Daniel Kaboré","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bancé, l'ancien","credit_id":"598baf0f925141080100244b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jules Taonssa","original_name":"Jules Taonssa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Raogo, le devin","credit_id":"598baf1cc3a36873a80023b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Ngourma","original_name":"Thomas Ngourma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Elie, le fou","credit_id":"598baf2792514107fa00243b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanfo Ablasse","original_name":"Sanfo Ablasse","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dancer / musician","credit_id":"598baf39925141080d0024d0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zounprana Boukare","original_name":"Zounprana Boukare","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dancer / musician","credit_id":"598baf46925141080d0024ee","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francois Dembele","original_name":"Francois Dembele","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dancer / musician","credit_id":"598baf5dc3a368739900257d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ami Kabre","original_name":"Ami Kabre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dancer / musician","credit_id":"598baf6992514107bc002522","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Lam Kaboré","original_name":"Gilbert Lam Kaboré","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Voice on Radio","credit_id":"598baf78c3a36873a800246d","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"S.
