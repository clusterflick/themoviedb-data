Refused a visa to travel to Poland, \"Jillski\" (her Polish nickname in the film) has to literally re-invent the documentary to deal with the Polish situation and she does so with a particular eye to deconstructing not only documentary's specific claims to objectivity, but also the bourgeois audience's desire to sit comfortably in their seats, feel compassion, feel themselves part of the solution (not part of the problem) by having felt compassion for the poor oppressed Poles, who, Godmilow would argue, are far more acutely aware of their situation and what forces oppress them than the liberal American folk in the movie house.","popularity":0.821,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far from Poland","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":156591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Maleczech","original_name":"Ruth Maleczech","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/iU9deeE41qiy3DGexVqPSJq78dH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anna Walentynowicz","credit_id":"61f7da1b0c4c1601097b35eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Margolis","original_name":"Mark Margolis","popularity":0.8523,"profile_path":"/rT5TYJIPLBkTqsrUs00AixGeaMM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Adam Zarewski","credit_id":"61f7da24dfaae9006aab9f7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olek Krupa","original_name":"Olek Krupa","popularity":0.6362,"profile_path":"/2SoniTSs89uf2jPx4Wvy3CBkdYs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jan (voice)","credit_id":"61f7da2d59e8a9001b110d54","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jill Godmilow","original_name":"Jill Godmilow","popularity":0.1935,"profile_path":"/L6v4GOwASyRLeU0ldDMVhvxwVv.jpg","credit_id":"53c83f510e0a267fe50051bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
