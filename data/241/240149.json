The centerpiece of the project is four short films. The first three (“Mud,” “Concrete” and “Glass”) draw on The New York Times's extraordinary visual archives, a repository of millions of photographs that have largely been unseen in decades. Each film is intended to evoke a chapter in a storybook, with rhyming narration and photographs brought to life with intricate animation. The fourth chapter (“Home”) comprises images submitted by the public. The interactive experience incorporates the films and, like a visual accordion, allows viewers to dig deeper into the project’s themes with additional archival materials, text and microgames.","popularity":1.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32686,"logo_path":"/6sDPxaKC0rGfxeWueXsYXu5YlDU.png","name":"The New York Times","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Short History of the Highrise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katerina Cizek","original_name":"Katerina Cizek","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e9fc3a36847f829d47b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":210052,"name":"urbanism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
