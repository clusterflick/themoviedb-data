Diagnosed with various and changing mental disorders, Anne faced several breakdowns and mental hospitals – experiences she documented and exorcised thoroughly through her films – particularly within the annals of Five Year Diary, a project spanning nearly two decades.  Though relentlessly intense and emotional, her films are not entirely bleak, for her bracing self-awareness and humor energize and bring a rare effulgence to the depths of her darkest moments.  Anne boldly exposed her most intimate and obsessive inner dialogues – from illness, breakdowns and longing for love to diets, cats and the minutia of existence.  She also considered the filmmaking experience therapeutic and cited the process as helping cure her depression.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/u6smgjW7is80x9LH1xIwGGdDSUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five-Year Diary","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Charlotte Robertson","original_name":"Anne Charlotte Robertson","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/ouVpNNWLxWclwV6TMsDzEfgu2Ux.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4eadc3a36847f82a0975","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Charlotte Robertson","original_name":"Anne Charlotte Robertson","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/ouVpNNWLxWclwV6TMsDzEfgu2Ux.jpg","credit_id":"5aeb44480e0a262b490057ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10958742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ybrlYGZjNV0PPQrE263LTPjbwwN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a8i1X1jCilxUKjEJenXrRAQ85KL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEmtzXsMeP6Xzdu0n7hZZaDJK9E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Z9rQGypMLr8d9ReGZ2FQWCM64P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u6smgjW7is80x9LH1xIwGGdDSUI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":842},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ap4NitJdmnqAmH9CcLQLQsSFNLA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":5,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Wikipedia (Filmed over 15 years)","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
