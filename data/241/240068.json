Much of the film focuses upon their happy and peaceful life of this family comprised of a young couple and their baby daughter Keto. Their life changes when two drifters come in. The two men (who seem to be Muslims from the Azerbaijan republic) are met with hospitality. They repay it by kidnapping baby Keto. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide","popularity":0.242,"poster_path":"/k3Fc9XwoOxExT5YCPQv65aeDzYw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91546,"logo_path":null,"name":"სტუდია \"სამება\"","origin_country":"GE"},{"id":91547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arsi","origin_country":"GE"},{"id":15326,"logo_path":"/f6GquNLbdxLWUVUb26jzPwmc3Nv.png","name":"Georgianfilm","origin_country":"GE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Lullaby","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"Iavnana","type":"Alternative"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nato Murvanidze","original_name":"ნატო მურვანიძე","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/rHj1RYZCmzW8POAiKkFD9YWJfsI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cf9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niko Tavadze","original_name":"Niko Tavadze","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/726dR1US4Ougq8AzAYnyRYBVbOI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cfa3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Abuladze","original_name":"Nino Abuladze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cfa7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Bagrationi","original_name":"Maya Bagrationi","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cfab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kakhi Kavsadze","original_name":"კახი კავსაძე","popularity":0.2757,"profile_path":"/6izdVXQGrDAxwjLYabA3hcin5oS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cfaf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otar Megvinetukhutsesi","original_name":"ოთარ მეღვინეთუხუცესი","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/nWWsofRNDAjsDemKg8ca7QFsOJp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cfb3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zurab Kavtaradze","original_name":"Zurab Kavtaradze","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59488d2a9251413fb604a197","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archil Tsitsishvili","original_name":"Archil Tsitsishvili","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59488d34c3a36826190267dc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natia Mokhevishvili","original_name":"Natia Mokhevishvili","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Angel / little girl","credit_id":"59488d479251413fbb04995f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edisher Magalashvili","original_name":"ედიშერ მაღალაშვილი","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/zjyL91LoZ7N8Si5D1cECpQO19gq.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6740bf6a4dfa06b5df92fe07","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nana Janelidze","original_name":"Nana Janelidze","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e9ec3a36847f829cfb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0325602","wikidata_id":"Q28319150","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ka","file_path":"/k3Fc9XwoOxExT5YCPQv65aeDzYw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
