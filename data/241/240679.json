He himself is a short-armed avowed hater of sport who cannot understand how anyone could take on such an odeal voluntarily. Even more since everyday life for people with a disability is most often challenging enough.  He meets U.S.archer Matt Stutzman, Norwegian table tennis player Aida Dahlen, German swimmer Christiane Reppe, Greek boccia player Greg Polychronidis and a Sitting Volleyball team. Niko neither spares the athletes nor himself asking questions about life, sport and fears. With an ever growing appreciation for sport Niko attends the Paralympic Games and travels back to the ancient city of Olympia, where everything began and where boccia playing is prohibited.","popularity":0.5668,"poster_path":"/1raie2FduBtmN6yXvzFHUujoOGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A disabled Niko von Glasow film about the paralympics","title":"My Way to Olympia","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2823366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Stutzman","original_name":"Matt Stutzman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f8f81a9ac617c0037843b5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2823368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aida Dahlen","original_name":"Aida Dahlen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f8f81dff90b19003702914c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2823369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Reppe","original_name":"Christiane Reppe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f8f81f1f8aee80033c5e8cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2823370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grigorios Polychronidis","original_name":"Grigorios Polychronidis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f8f8205d9f4a60038d62dec","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niko von Glasow","original_name":"Niko von Glasow","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eaac3a36847f829fefb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niko von Glasow","original_name":"Niko von Glasow","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8f821043cd540039fe832a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2669646","wikidata_id":"Q16998398","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ie4p5dpRC3hpP62RRJYXMTCmFDf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1raie2FduBtmN6yXvzFHUujoOGr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":994,"name":"paralympics"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Way To Olympia - Official Trailer","key":"zUugq9rUWok","published_at":"2013-02-12T11:01:59.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec724c3a368544800b86e"}]}}}
