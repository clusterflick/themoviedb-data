Both are listed as killed in action during the Great War. It is Armistice Day, 1918, and the war is over. Who should be strolling down the street but Jimmy Gubbins, Bill 'Jones' and another man who has lost his memory. They are ghosts as the official records list them as dead and not as escaped P.O.W's. Jimmy's mother is not happy to see that Jimmy is still living as she has been spending the death benefits, but she is happy to see Bill as there is a large reward for him. No one knows much about the third one, called 'Spoofy', except that he can steal anything at anytime and that gets everyone is trouble.","popularity":0.4402,"poster_path":"/1cXYePW07LY84kmbbiSX63y4P0l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feature Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":13913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joseph M.
