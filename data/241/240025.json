Featuring a rhythmic soundscape and paint-on-glass animation, the film shows a woman’s hands reaching in and out of the frame, cutting and editing a reel of film on a flatbed editing table. She splices, scrubs, rewinds and rolls the sound and images. Fragments of animated archival footage flash across the screen: women walking in chains, protesting with placards, speaking at podiums. We hear bursts of words and the percussive whir and click of the Steenbeck—until a “message” is finally revealed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assembly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
