The film is roughly divided into two portions; in the first, the main character speaks directly to the audience and introduces several pilots for the movie, which are played in their entirety. These include The Mighty Lady—an 8-milimeter student film produced in 1983—and two 1984 films simply titled Mighty Lady. This is followed by the film's main body, an original story in which Mighty Lady attempts to live life as a schoolgirl, then fights a giant robot.","popularity":0.6707,"poster_path":"/oXDgT1lxsDaeoEulyzJyMsZbAtg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ogawa Modeling","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":880,"logo_path":"/vwhPRAZ4lhUtSuaifk4Au2MIm92.png","name":"Daiei Film","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All About Mighty Lady","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3726364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misae Ueno","original_name":"Misae Ueno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mai Hanasaki / Mighty Lady","credit_id":"633c0d29481382007d4ae4d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ichiro Ômomo","original_name":"Ichiro Ômomo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61479fa1efd3c2002dba23cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ichiro Ômomo","original_name":"Ichiro Ômomo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c0d3d87f3f2007a3083a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3726365,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Osamu Nagashima","original_name":"Osamu Nagashima","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c0d4acf48a1007a7e7953","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3726366,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Toshio Tagawa","original_name":"Toshio Tagawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633c0d5b4cbe120079a33fcb","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80930,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yutaka Izubuchi","original_name":"出渕裕","popularity":0.3783,"profile_path":"/i5VbEU91iQMrfByrrSoZsQGv3Sg.jpg","credit_id":"633c0ebd87f3f2007f2f731b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":896,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oXDgT1lxsDaeoEulyzJyMsZbAtg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":608},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fnb8ZuTBBupoEvSbW8UmSI3GibU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":226060,"name":"japanese girl hero"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1984-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
