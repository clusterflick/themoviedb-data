She’s leaving to study English abroad soon but hasn’t told her boyfriend Benja (18), who found out about it on social media. This is her last chance to clear the air between them and also decide what will happen with the relationship. During the weekend, Amalia worsens the situation by ignoring it and pretending that everything’s fine, but Anto (18) reprimands her and helps her realize that she must solve what’s inside her own head before confronting Benja.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En la playa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisca Valenzuela","original_name":"Francisca Valenzuela","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"611e78e7ac4161005cdd5bc8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximiliano Parra","original_name":"Maximiliano Parra","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"611e78f1a22d3e0046a6109e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Pablo Latorre","original_name":"Juan Pablo Latorre","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"611e78f7cca7de007cf33f3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2314299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camila Roeschmann","original_name":"Camila Roeschmann","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/73L0K52g4NFQF78hlJEF5je1TsJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"611e78ff85c0a2002a51c60f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Salvador","original_name":"Nina Salvador","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"611e790ef03174002c9f3851","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204103,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francisco Rodriguez Pozo","original_name":"Francisco Rodriguez Pozo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e79583a4a12002f4df380","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximiliano Scheleff","original_name":"Maximiliano Scheleff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e7935c14fee004535e40b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204103,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francisco Rodriguez Pozo","original_name":"Francisco Rodriguez Pozo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e794ca22d3e0046a61141","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646665,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hisashi Tanida","original_name":"Hisashi Tanida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e796ec14fee00256e4b9f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204106,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ana Fernández","original_name":"Ana Fernández","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e79825437f5004514dbf2","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simón Arias","original_name":"Simón Arias","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e79412e0697005da34d10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204107,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Scheleff","original_name":"Max Scheleff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e798e3876510073144019","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximiliano Scheleff","original_name":"Maximiliano Scheleff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e7926ca83540074cd75bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximiliano Scheleff","original_name":"Maximiliano Scheleff","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e792e2e0697005da34cd7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Renata Ag","original_name":"Renata Ag","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e79643a4a120046dfd822","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
