Written and directed by Michele Wright, Ph.D., and produced by Butterbean Productions, this movie emotionally depicts Terry’s roughly 5 ½-decade painful and surreal journey from childhood to adulthood to finally being diagnosed with CF “54 YEARS LATE”!","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/lPQNWrYfeidXmgOQJN1RQwzwzj7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Butterbean
