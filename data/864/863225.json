Since 2007, she has been fighting against the construction of an industrial road that will run through the village. When the construction was stopped because of protests from residents, the village gradually turned into a nature space where we could enjoy the four seasons as grass and trees began to grow. In the meantime, various cultural and artistic events are held there, and various artists visit there.
