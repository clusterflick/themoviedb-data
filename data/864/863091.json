But there is so much more to these gentle giants: their exceptional body, their distinctive behavior, and their social lives. So far, giraffes have been decorative extras in many wildlife films, towering over the savannah. Our production takes a fresh look at the tallest animals of all, revealing brand new details about the African icon. We present giraffes in the savannah of Kenya, in the South African grassland as well as in the desert of Namibia. Experience never before seen material that will add up to a comprehensive and entertaining portrait of Nature’s High Society.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rcE0ivU2tDOqXwTGH7cF4gw9T6B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giraffe: African Giant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iPsqTnlllEek5wtKw76bROdDJSU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/eAPSe581rMkK0QW0AmEEiejjR0d.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x96460CvM3Mn317J56um53hbCIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i2C6Qjm5cdoNkZqOaFiPxBrEZtA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fHBeTyfew988izLNBQ2kK8TkKc8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/19pYU52IwCXjUXTq7k4zEfEgIlP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rsT2krCdoyOjJQK5JrDpgwJYa1o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i5ZBaURpb0LMpyeSpDJpCVstTi5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.556,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/2i56bhqz8rYKNCm6BeYhSVtEu23.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3323},{"aspect_ratio":2.546,"height":377,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/vO7PvW5iYFJ0csKaWXhGYIyEqXc.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/uSrdoRb7KWq054nMOTGC08xVJNI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2818,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/cEXy04JaeHwbGcQtdBfpWZhr02J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rcE0ivU2tDOqXwTGH7cF4gw9T6B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Geographic","release_date":"2015-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
