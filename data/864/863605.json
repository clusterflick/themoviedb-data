In particular, power companies with right-of-way corridors and buffer zones are uniquely positioned to create large pollinator highways. These untapped areas have the potential to become one of the largest pollinator projects in history. If power companies and other land managers choose to work together planting flowers and reducing chemical use across the landscape, we can bring back pollinators and—with them—a host of essential food and ecosystem resources. As electricity flows through the landscape, power companies can help pollinators flow through the ecosystem.","popularity":0.472,"poster_path":"/4OSres6DrllPiBMm8mc5mRjKQli.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tree Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power for Pollinators","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie-Anne Moss","original_name":"Carrie-Anne Moss","popularity":2.2647,"profile_path":"/xD4jTA3KmVp5Rq3aHcymL9DUGjD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"611faf7f2dc44e002c490831","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mathew Schmid","original_name":"Mathew Schmid","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/bnmwPIt8jH4SlQG1UvK8cJF5z6v.jpg","credit_id":"611fb012a22d3e005e2b7f74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mathew Schmid","original_name":"Mathew Schmid","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/bnmwPIt8jH4SlQG1UvK8cJF5z6v.jpg","credit_id":"611fb019a22d3e0046a7ac6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leila Conners","original_name":"Leila Conners","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/wJYA9TwE8BGdKWFPn3rZU2CjHVx.jpg","credit_id":"611fb0295437f50074c70e2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mathew Schmid","original_name":"Mathew Schmid","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/bnmwPIt8jH4SlQG1UvK8cJF5z6v.jpg","credit_id":"611fb092a22d3e00754fb6e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Fox","original_name":"Jessica Fox","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/ryvhaXqwPrO66uwEOMT6AmS4Tb2.jpg","credit_id":"611fb0a2f03174005d57eaa4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2354448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George DiCaprio","original_name":"George DiCaprio","popularity":0.0425,"profile_path":"/dHPxzNlHIpsleiMWjAuF91DEblP.jpg","credit_id":"611fb0b066ae4d002d44a9b0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1600318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harun Mehmedinović","original_name":"Harun Mehmedinović","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611fb0c3d1a893002ddb42d6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leila Conners","original_name":"Leila Conners","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/wJYA9TwE8BGdKWFPn3rZU2CjHVx.jpg","credit_id":"611fb175f03174005d57ebfc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14170542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"pollinatorsunderpressure.org","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"PollinatorsP"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4OSres6DrllPiBMm8mc5mRjKQli.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
