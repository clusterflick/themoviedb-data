Blending voice narratives in four languages, moving images and literary texts, the film is mainly made from home video collections created in the 1990s from both filmmakers’ families, with home videos shot in the 1960s by a Hong Kong family as interludes. The film not only unfolds how East Asian families created their own image with amateur filming devices but also tells stories of migration, travelling, growing and familial relationships.​","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qRK0rujGK4Ly9EQhc0jT0KDYejU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anachronic Chronicles: Voyages Inside/Out Asia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"시대착오적 연대기 : 아시아 안팎의 항해","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Anachronic Chronicle: A Voyage through Inside-Out Asia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pan Lu","original_name":"Pan Lu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e9bc985c0a2007f1e18e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Araki Yu","original_name":"Araki Yu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611e9be2f03174005d567281","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRK0rujGK4Ly9EQhc0jT0KDYejU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1375}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ Docs(DMZ International Documentary Film Festival)","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
