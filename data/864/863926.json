It is between 1901 and 1907 that the seeds of all his future work lie, for it is then that Picasso turned his back on his father's teachings and broke free from academic constraints and himself at the beginning with everything that crossed his path.  This documentary takes a look at Picasso's various metamorphoses, shaped by a struggle between zest for life and dark thoughts. A world shared by his friend Jaime Sabartés, who wrote it in a collection of memoirs.  Art documentary (2018) by Gaëlle Royer.","popularity":0.1093,"poster_path":"/pvZfUzB6hGLXzYPUiV8wIC9uJAH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32644,"logo_path":"/A1Gn9NgWOdA6IaJ0GzUJYfGiNPO.png","name":"Program33","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2381,"logo_path":"/hmzO0vmTZjfGoMoS5pykenpmHWH.png","name":"Musée d'Orsay","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This documentary takes a look at Picasso's various metamorphoses, all shaped by a struggle between zest for life and dark thoughts.","title":"Picasso Metamorphoses in Blue and Pink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1581894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gaëlle Royer","original_name":"Gaëlle Royer","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6120e57c85c0a2007f2151b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2555874,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Doublet","original_name":"Christine Doublet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6120e5a9719aeb007d3f057a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9372058","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1k3dAjGbFCr1a1P0HuKbIvvUrX3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pvZfUzB6hGLXzYPUiV8wIC9uJAH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
