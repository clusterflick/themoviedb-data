Henry hasn't been outside for years. The camera follows a day in his life - his simple daily chores and his eccentric rituals. Henry looks like a European from a good family, but has many Asian habits. The second protagonist is the building in which Henry is staying: the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. It is one of the best preserved examples of chinoise architecture and furnishing in the world. Neither the client nor the architect had ever set foot in Asia. In a monologue, a parallel narrative unfolds in a game with reality and fiction. Word and image, fiction and documentary become intertwined with each other and point across the frontiers of ‘East’ versus ‘West’.","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":"/on2b0KkAhGHsc5ZCxMHOuxq6zse.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruim Kader Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2007-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lapse of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Leysen","original_name":"Johan Leysen","popularity":0.3145,"profile_path":"/pCBvrMKTNo6cqC63qDSipbtt2Rs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6121050e0f2fbd006196364a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Tan","original_name":"Fiona Tan","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/tQGwVuSHb4TNKlDLXeWJdtGeTVV.jpg","credit_id":"612104cffd4a96002ef1b95c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Tan","original_name":"Fiona Tan","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/tQGwVuSHb4TNKlDLXeWJdtGeTVV.jpg","credit_id":"612104bb9f0e190028dfb6a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaap van Hoewijk","original_name":"Jaap van Hoewijk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zvlJevqZKtp9p26eSEXU0gDz6fY.jpg","credit_id":"612104dc2dc44e0045c3d55a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1017,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/on2b0KkAhGHsc5ZCxMHOuxq6zse.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
