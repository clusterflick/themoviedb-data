It’s approximately 16 minutes long. This video follows and explains my racist behaviors as a teenager and young adult and my transition into having anti-racist values. It explores the location in which I was raised, and how my relationship with Traverse City, Michigan played a role in developing my racist behaviors. This is not meant to be an excuse for my racism, nor a justification of it, but rather it’s an exploration of the journey it took for me to let go of old behaviors and embrace new values.  The video is woven together through an open letter to my younger self, and supplemented by videos and stills that reflect how my relationship with the environments I’m in and have been in, have influenced me.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":"/mV8ISYxSLXAh0PVzkTcPPvS9Qf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Open Letter to My Younger Self: A Personal Documentary Overview Credits Specifications","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3205485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caelum Gay","original_name":"Caelum Gay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611fa79d9f0e190028ddeabb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3205485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caelum Gay","original_name":"Caelum Gay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611fa7a5fd4a960047f7dff1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mV8ISYxSLXAh0PVzkTcPPvS9Qf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Pacific Northwest College of Art Focus Week - BFA Thesis Premiere, Portland, OR","release_date":"2020-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
