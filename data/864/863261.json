For a ceasefire, the Allied and Communist forces began to hold talks at Naebongjang, located northeast of Kaesong. However, they only sharply opposed each other and didn't make progress in the  negotiation. In October 1951, the two sides met again in the small village of Neolmun-ri below Gaeseong. They set up tents there to negotiate and named the place Panmunjom. The name Panmunjeom is a combination word of Panmun, meaning Neulmun-ri, and “Jom,” of an inn.","popularity":0.3914,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112196,"logo_path":"/t7iLYzrj825rY7CqEG7xS4IUOOB.png","name":"Newstapa","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PAN MUN JOM, You have never seen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"판문점","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark W.
