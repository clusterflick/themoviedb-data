Cuban Missile Crisis. The world is on the brink of nuclear disaster. Khrushchev has no leverage over the stubborn commander. The only thing he could do was send someone to Cuba whom he trusted, someone who could convince Castro. This person was Anastas Mikoyan. He was accompanied on his mission by Roman Carmen, a legendary cameraman who filmed the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Nuremberg Trials. Mikoyan's business trip lasted almost a month. Day after day, step by step, like a real psychologist, he talked with Castro and Che Guevara, listened to their calls to \"die beautifully\" and destroy the enemy with one blow, and tried to persuade Cuba to compromise to save the world. This film was born thanks to recently declassified documents.","popularity":0.4602,"poster_path":"/z45aO4ZqKzu4IKpP3k9Sq0HDLlk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217449,"logo_path":null,"name":"PK Cargofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One-on-one facing the threat of nuclear war","title":"A History of an Assignment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Istoriya odnoy komandirovki","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"History of One Business Trip","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2611675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastas Mikoyan","original_name":"Anastas Mikoyan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/iPUYGzwGAmMPmHYM3Tu4RIzndDF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65953b0dea37e006fa4be19b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
