Taking place across various landscapes and locations, the project builds upon a postcolonial perspective informed by technology, agency and the body, and narratives of migration.  In the short film, a Relic Traveller is featured apparating sites across a seemingly desolate United Kingdom. Uncovering fragments of audible data presenting clue-like testimonies to a forgotten Empire, the Relic Traveller soon finds themselves in an atmosphere that simultaneously delivers poetic moments of the sublime met with increasingly harrowing claustrophobia and tales of trauma. Thus resulting in a familiar feeling of otherness, we are invited on a journey that embodies hysteria.","popularity":0.0603,"poster_path":"/8yUTL1o8n1pb388SDl3JoHdyPUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150308,"logo_path":null,"name":"PS/Y","origin_country":""},{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts
