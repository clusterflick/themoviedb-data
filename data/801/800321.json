Alan Jungarrayi wants to move with his family to the nearest town in the hope of finding work. His wife, Jean Napanangka, wants to remain in the community to fulfil her tribal obligations and to bring up their children in their culture. She fears that if they leave the children will lose their language and grow up 'with too much Western ways and thoughts', and thus lose their Warlpiri identity and their place within the world.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":"/qildaLRTmB6fCBM3H7L02nQCreO.png","name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An exploration of Warlpiri language and Identity","title":"Ways of Thinking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Napanangka","original_name":"Jean Napanangka","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6037055497eab40040d440e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Jampijinpa","original_name":"Ned Jampijinpa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6037055d71458f003ebdd188","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Napangardi","original_name":"Judith Napangardi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"603705633e01ea003c71aa67","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Penelope McDonald","original_name":"Penelope McDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603706313e01ea003e71cae8","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469251,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denise Haslem","original_name":"Denise Haslem","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037064097eab40041d3d202","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim Conway","original_name":"Jim Conway","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037069187a27a003f137ad6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990026,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janice Digby Duncan","original_name":"Janice Digby Duncan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603705c0e62719003f28f67b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064326,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philip Bull","original_name":"Philip Bull","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037060c87a27a003d139bec","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janice Digby Duncan","original_name":"Janice Digby Duncan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603705b9afa1b0003fa70df1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Fiske","original_name":"Pat Fiske","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037061d5b370d00403ccba2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Watson","original_name":"Colin Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603706b0764841003d989563","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2990025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janice Digby Duncan","original_name":"Janice Digby Duncan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603705d7e627190040288ee3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
