Using his tweets and first-hand testimony from White House insiders, this documentary for BBC Three explores how the president of the United States came of age on Twitter and documents the impact of his tweets on politics in America and across the world.  With unprecedented access to people in his inner circle and interviews with experts, journalists and some of his most avid Twitter followers, this documentary tells the story of how Trump weaponised Twitter and used it as a tool to shape policy, conduct diplomacy and wage war on the establishment.  Trump in Tweets features interviews with, to mention but a few, Anthony Scaramucci, former White House director of communications, who reveals what it is like when the president turns his Twitter feed on you, Sean Spicer, Trump’s first presidential press secretary, who got caught between the president’s tweeting and the press, and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer.","popularity":0.0799,"poster_path":"/f7K4gAvD6249CzIBojpF8GAReCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144562,"logo_path":"/9OeGKAVHdOkdeGTpg3ucs86ABPP.png","name":"Wonderhood Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From a technophobe to a serial tweeter, documenting the impact of Donald Trump's social media across the world","title":"Trump in Tweets","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019516,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emma Lorenz","original_name":"Emma Lorenz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057df759ae61300548998a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emeka Onono","original_name":"Emeka Onono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057df4d880551006cdb9f21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emeka Onono","original_name":"Emeka Onono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057df8b01e4d1003ded407c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11444806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7K4gAvD6249CzIBojpF8GAReCG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
