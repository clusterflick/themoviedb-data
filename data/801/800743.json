Written by Matsutaro Kawaguchi for Hibari Misora to celebrate her 25th anniversary. The film tells the story of a fisherman's daughter from Izumo who rises from poverty to Kyoto, throws herself into the harsh world of dance, abandons her promised future and love, and finds the path to womanhood by living a life devoted to her art, which is rooted in the masses. Hibari Misora plays the role of a 16-year-old girl to a mature 26-year-old woman in this film, which also contains many autobiographical elements of the singer, who made her debut at the age of 8 and has continued to sing about the joys and sorrows of the common people, thereby touching the hearts of the Japanese people.","popularity":0.3849,"poster_path":"/gdRyMd3yrYFyBt1AxKrVUsyrDg5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tokyo
