While they once made up the vast majority of the country, today they are only a tiny minority and are faced with an immense challenge: to continue to feed France. From the figure of the simple tenant farmer described by Emile Guillaumin at the beginning of the 20th century to the heavy toll paid by peasants during the Great War, from the beginnings of mechanization in the inter-war period to the ambivalent figure of the peasant under the Occupation, From the unbridled race to industrialization in post-war France to the realization that it is now necessary to rethink the agricultural model and invent the agriculture of tomorrow, the film looks back at the long march of French peasants.","popularity":0.7016,"poster_path":"/kRGmgc4qKEVIGcBB0XxtLaB9JVG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nous paysans","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Canet","original_name":"Guillaume Canet","popularity":1.448,"profile_path":"/yxerAhXValEezb1EuV9XWc9L8KC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrateur","credit_id":"6525aa1f629b2c00c59c5860","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2989169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnès Poirier","original_name":"Agnès Poirier","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60362591e62719003e27d19a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2053045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabien Beziat","original_name":"Fabien Beziat","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/z3qNc1iuYVTl1qzCh4xt8WnD1ao.jpg","credit_id":"6036257ceec5b5003e1b36c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14128396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1UaYzG3N77JlI9eWG0bFMcvGgWb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1914},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/779urtMhwTy4zhtfy7iv1BKroRO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1915},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/afLOEUAXGaFPNadFd79Ioh0DQzQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vl7qkRKsB7UXwbbPFLSwBXAjJVx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1755}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kRGmgc4qKEVIGcBB0XxtLaB9JVG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/43hfTSOB5B23LPKu2OdXyDJeaNO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nI4EY2d6J1bdH1612IYXUpSk9V6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":4402,"name":"peasant"},{"id":5888,"name":"agriculture"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":182651,"name":"life changing"},{"id":192227,"name":"working conditions"},{"id":219923,"name":"life challenges"},{"id":223069,"name":"challenge for change"},{"id":255834,"name":"rural life"},{"id":272556,"name":"social conditioning"},{"id":280411,"name":"social conditions"},{"id":281657,"name":"rural depopulation"},{"id":298535,"name":"rural drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
