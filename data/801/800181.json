A man cleans his workwear from a vanishing distance with an air hose. Three trembling steel cables emerge from a grey metal building. A large dump truck with a full load passes by. In a deeply green forest landscape there is a dark monolith. You can hear jingling metal noises from the off, which cause a spreading echo. A white cargo helicopter is slowly approaching for landing. A dredger moves in a circle on the surface of the water. In \"Objects and Artifacts\", various pictorial elements come into contact with each other in a situational manner and create a friction surface that deals with forms of a post-apocalyptic landscape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/Z83ulFPxnWa1XKPOSV630s9U7j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Objects and Artifacts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Brim","original_name":"Viktor Brim","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6036a0222476f200422ff7c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Z83ulFPxnWa1XKPOSV630s9U7j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Light Cone","release_date":"2019-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Light Cone / ATELIER 105 ONLINE","release_date":"2021-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art ","release_date":"2020-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
