When Hossein Khandan nominates Dorsa to play the leading role in Abbas Kiarostami’s next film slated to shoot in China, Dorsa’s mom, who shares her passion for acting and the arts and is unconditionally on Dorsa’s side, becomes an acting coach to help her through the casting process; whereas her father opposes his daughter’s involvement in anything other than her studies.
