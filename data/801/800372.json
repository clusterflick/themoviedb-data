If the general public has remained on his television appearances of the 80s, the fact remains that Gainsbourg had several careers before these last years. With Gainsbourg stripped of his masks, this is the theme of this self-portrait documentary: \"In the end, I was left with the watermark of this shy and secretive child who implies candor, innocence, insubordination and savagery\". Each sequence of this modest and passionate portrait reveals a secret, intimate, funny and touching Gainsbourg, at a good distance from Gainsbarre, his last public face.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/kyOYQN5tM5BRPvcGnlFWV12RF4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39460,"logo_path":"/AiQxylbHR61M4NA6KmQ2aFKhOt2.png","name":"Siècle Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gainsbourg, toute une vie","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Benhamou","original_name":"Stéphane Benhamou","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603764e715959f0040872103","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvain Bergère","original_name":"Sylvain Bergère","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/xSYhXuTRkbeByvpbVc7zCRflRhk.jpg","credit_id":"603764faeec5b5003c1c4f78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14134178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fX4R4efx0PpIUnx8ldWOCr1tzwl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":757,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kyOYQN5tM5BRPvcGnlFWV12RF4Q.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1aAbACWn4533hpZFEbbY2okuOQa.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RTS Un","release_date":"2021-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 3","release_date":"2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
