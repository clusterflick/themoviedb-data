Even to good boys all the way across the country in New Hampshire, the authority-flouting baseball A's and football Raiders were magical. Not only did they win championships, they did it amid clubhouse brawls, feuds with an owner and a general embrace of the 1960s aesthetic.  Filmmakers Rick Bernstein and Ross Greenburg tell the stories of these turbulent, talented teams and show how they perfectly fit their city. Oakland was blue collar and home to hardcore hard-core 1960s rebellion, exemplified by the Black Panthers. Oakland, especially, was not San Francisco, the effete, world-class city across the bay.\"","popularity":1.3687,"poster_path":"/rc9ovrusS56WpuR79BaYksmEEhq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6751,"logo_path":"/giPzzhPdiNloiuwo7qLagRn5uGH.png","name":"HBO Sports","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary that shows the dynasty years of the Oakland Raiders and Oakland A's in the 1970's.","title":"Rebels of Oakland: The A's, The Raiders, The '70s","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Madden","original_name":"John Madden","popularity":0.2763,"profile_path":"/z0msDsLeFxfE70DkIKstymRlTKf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c16290e0a264cc10531d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reggie Jackson","original_name":"Reggie Jackson","popularity":0.1604,"profile_path":"/1gtMYqHEIZpOEj77umS7i7NW7Oe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c1660c3a3680b9a058489","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1930680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Santana","original_name":"Chuck Santana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c1644c3a3680b9d050a5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Stabler","original_name":"Kenny Stabler","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/rhx5AfUQXsB2ZpPkOjJw5v2kthf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c1652c3a3680b93054a8d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1214285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rollie Fingers","original_name":"Rollie Fingers","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c166cc3a3680b8f05423b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Hanks","original_name":"Tom Hanks","popularity":8.8459,"profile_path":"/eKF1sGJRrZJbfBG1KirPt1cfNd3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c161cc3a3680b8a0533af","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liev Schreiber","original_name":"Liev Schreiber","popularity":2.5942,"profile_path":"/gTHvDnTN52iTdnQPVPu6LhirUHc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c16af9251410336054bc3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MC Hammer","original_name":"MC Hammer","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":"/cAGR9cxdg6NfBbpyWKkWHfe5i1G.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1c16b7c3a3680b9d050abd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Lipari","original_name":"Joe Lipari","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1c17150e0a264cc805689f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Deford","original_name":"Frank Deford","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/3qhgeCsNqQO9flTHpnUv6GpTTL8.jpg","credit_id":"5a1c167fc3a3680b9d050a88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Allan","original_name":"Mark Allan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1c17080e0a264cc4052169","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53468,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tom Swartwout","original_name":"Tom Swartwout","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1c17360e0a264cbc056632","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim Dooley","original_name":"Jim Dooley","popularity":0.2011,"profile_path":"/hiy21xMnnk4Txnziy8dMkgVFGY3.jpg","credit_id":"5ab8d9df925141490600b801","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0391416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rc9ovrusS56WpuR79BaYksmEEhq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":579,"name":"american football"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
