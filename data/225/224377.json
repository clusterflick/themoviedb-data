Franz, a journalist, maintains relationships with four women. His three mistresses are introduced with television dreams of intense emotional violence (in the first dream, a mother shouts at her daughter, explaining that as a girl, she does not deserve a room of her own), and the fourth is his wife. He is desperate to have each to himself. Franz never offers a substantial sign of love, but is willing to say anything and make any promise for affection. His dependence on women for fulfilment is explained through arguments with his wife. He claims \"I am my own sound. The women produce voices within me.\" An understandable and sometimes sympathetic antagonist is one of the films greatest strengths. The emotional damage he causes becomes believable.","popularity":0.3586,"poster_path":"/8rJQcWax4rrDFBmqdKpB5WUAjGt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Menschenfrauen","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1974376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elly Naschold","original_name":"Elly Naschold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7ba59dc3a3680f860057c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lukas Resetarits","original_name":"Lukas Resetarits","popularity":0.1685,"profile_path":"/zKGHNCNKpu36r6l8PZiV9BUtMtG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a7ba5a70e0a2632f0005c13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Wildbolz","original_name":"Klaus Wildbolz","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/oHRlgAPZLNde53tzmDgc4BZbEaK.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Franz","credit_id":"5f1022691684f700359b86f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Widl","original_name":"Susanne Widl","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Anna Sand","credit_id":"5f1022776dea3a0032efb968","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Martina","original_name":"Maria Martina","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Gertrud","credit_id":"5f10228123d27800370aa8ee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1479894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Felden","original_name":"Renée Felden","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Elisabeth","credit_id":"5f1022952d8ef300373eb24d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane von Aster","original_name":"Christiane von Aster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5f10239e6dea3a0035ef6d53","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valie Export","original_name":"Valie Export","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tl9mnr8YhhvdIwRBKr7LohARBRH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e3b9251416c7514f981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolfgang Dickmann","original_name":"Wolfgang Dickmann","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1022332d8ef300363cb817","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valie Export","original_name":"Valie Export","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/tl9mnr8YhhvdIwRBKr7LohARBRH.jpg","credit_id":"5f10225b6743fa0035d19b34","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Friedl Mayer","original_name":"Friedl Mayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f10225223d27800370aa83f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1999457,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tina Frese","original_name":"Tina Frese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1022422d8ef300383c8ee7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Weibel","original_name":"Peter Weibel","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f102229dff66e00357a6b8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Kases","original_name":"Karl Kases","popularity":0.2978,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f10223a6743fa0035d19b0f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0384333","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8rJQcWax4rrDFBmqdKpB5WUAjGt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
