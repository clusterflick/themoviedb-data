She starts a grassroots movement that is fueled by passion, but appears to be losing the battle. Then, unexpectedly, she realizes that the corporations accidentally left her a giant loophole. In a scramble to take advantage of this unforeseen gift, she leads the crusade passing legislation protecting animals from de-clawing in seven cities in just six weeks.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story about the fight for those who have no voice.","title":"The Paw Project","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Conrad","original_name":"Jennifer Conrad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e309251416c7514e3e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2447750","wikidata_id":"Q16254028","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Paw Project Movie - Official Theatrical Trailer","key":"Qw8OJN4ctyo","published_at":"2013-09-04T01:10:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec71dc3a368544800b3d1"}]}}}
