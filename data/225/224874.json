An intimate story about a Pole and a German placed by war on enemy sides and their parallel lives accidentally brought together.  The film reflects on the concepts of invaders, victim, guilt and forgiveness. It confronts different experiences and their paradoxical similarities. It deals with the controversial subject of the post-war accountings. The visual narration is flowing, guided by memories and archives. Traditional documentation confronts experimental use of archival footage in the cinematic impression about displacement.","popularity":0.2102,"poster_path":"/eGUVVB6taZxLvQPAcuKSszmzM3T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajda Studio","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":121500,"logo_path":"/5uN88a9tHaFI7cVbvwTeZNFkBku.png","name":"Vezfilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":56039,"logo_path":"/e0v3d3HZYw0th0NBetUSaR2MCyP.png","name":"Pomerania Film","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My House Without Me","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Grześkowiak","original_name":"Janina Grześkowiak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"586d78309251414321001995","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annemarie Liermann","original_name":"Annemarie Liermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"586d7848c3a368395a001c22","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732785,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Paruch","original_name":"Stefan Paruch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d79b99251414321001a8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732789,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Ślesicki","original_name":"Adam Ślesicki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d7aaac3a3683954001b83","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Szymków","original_name":"Magdalena Szymków","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d790b9251414313001b60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421498,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomasz Wieczorek","original_name":"Tomasz Wieczorek","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d7a499251414310001bfc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732788,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alicja Kizińska","original_name":"Alicja Kizińska","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d7a939251414321001b14","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732784,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kurt Moser","original_name":"Kurt Moser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d79a69251414310001b89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421498,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomasz Wieczorek","original_name":"Tomasz Wieczorek","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d7a669251414310001c0f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesco Ragazzi","original_name":"Francesco Ragazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d7ac5c3a368394d001cf7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732787,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominika Czakon","original_name":"Dominika Czakon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d7a7e9251414325001b16","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magdalena Szymków","original_name":"Magdalena Szymków","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586d79259251414315001b7a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380856,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paweł Chorzępa","original_name":"Paweł Chorzępa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f746c2719675700389d8a0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2610200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eGUVVB6taZxLvQPAcuKSszmzM3T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":1526,"name":"home"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
