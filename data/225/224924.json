It was produced by Marcel Varnel, Ben Henry and Columbia (British) Productions.  This comedy explores the wayward rivalry between mechanic and Home Guard Lance Corporal George Singleton (George Formby) and an adversary also in the Home Guard (Ronald Shiner). When the rival Home Guard units of Major Wallop and Minor Wallop are sent on battle manoeuvres, George Singleton (Formby) launches his own unique style of commando raid against neighbouring Major Wallop to steal a Vickers machine gun. The raid fails and Singleton loses his Lance Corporal's stripe, so he and a little evacuee girl named Irene (Vera Frances) decide to fall back on 'Plan B' - to build their very own tank.","popularity":0.6055,"poster_path":"/zoUq0a2pZERyUHQDJ7heBc9E9Et.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1943-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"George joins the Home Guard and saves the day with his secret weapon!","title":"Get Cracking","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Formby","original_name":"George Formby","popularity":0.1691,"profile_path":"/yRDa51t7OvdYfNcQgdFLwFrP6KY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"George Singleton","credit_id":"535cf1e9c3a36830b0003d8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinah Sheridan","original_name":"Dinah Sheridan","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":"/9DBEFocvJYMIsOxgDnPPHp0QYZO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Pemberton","credit_id":"535cf1f9c3a3683084003e61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Rigby","original_name":"Edward Rigby","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/fSu8T7lKswhIECZeMyzTDY65Git.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sam Elliott","credit_id":"535cf209c3a3683091003d0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Shiner","original_name":"Ronald Shiner","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/zTruk0LK1TfWhFHxjQyjX1z4W9l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Everett Manley","credit_id":"535cf21bc3a36830a0003ce1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Pettingell","original_name":"Frank Pettingell","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/wKdzspi5CETjZIJClGYWWuFcVAU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alf Pemberton","credit_id":"5bd45c41c3a3682100019a09","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wally Patch","original_name":"Wally Patch","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/uOmiC8x6gwaGBOa40h0c1zY8c7J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sgt.
