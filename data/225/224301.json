They end up in the remote mountain town of Blueridge, where Karen (Marina Resa) believes her older sister went missing 2 years before. After a few odd encounters with the locals, Karen and her friends decide to continue their journey until an unexpected auto malfunction leaves them stranded. The group takes refuge in a local motel and soon learns that in Blueridge, \"missing persons\" is just a way of life. One-by-one they begin disappearing until the grizzly discovery is made that the local BBQ Rib Restaurant might be serving up more than anyone had bargained.","popularity":1.9265,"poster_path":"/izrVq0EEltj9vHdW6XEFdsnaA1N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17148,"logo_path":null,"name":"MKSK Global Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Out here, you're on your own.","title":"Roadside Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Texas Roadside Massacre","type":"(DVD title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Resa","original_name":"Marina Resa","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/31c3YI3qUgEv4ZlUyk62z3aNKR1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karen","credit_id":"52fe4e389251416c7514f351","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elio Mardini","original_name":"Elio Mardini","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"52fe4e389251416c7514f355","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dusty Probert","original_name":"Dusty Probert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gus","credit_id":"52fe4e389251416c7514f359","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Schiltz","original_name":"Matthew Schiltz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vince","credit_id":"52fe4e389251416c7514f35d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fragino M.
