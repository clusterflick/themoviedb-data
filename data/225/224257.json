Elizabeth and the firm's top designer, Tony Blanchard, are having an affair. A particularly nasty blackmailer confronts her with pictures, threatening to give them to Cole; she and Tony agree to pay, but after two deaths and a torched house, things have gotten complicated: infidelity pales next to a murder charge. A high-school yearbook photo takes her further into danger. What motive might explain and connect the twists? Is she ensnared beyond hope?","popularity":1.4244,"poster_path":"/7hXKlxQmzXWtZqVbRCtSX87NgF1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9024,"logo_path":null,"name":"World International Network
