He was the 'passenger' riding on the sidecar, and he explains how the word 'passenger' is such a misnomer for the bravery and athleticism required to do such a skillful occupation. We watch footage of his racing days, including the biggest race of the year at The Belgian Grand Prix in Spa in 1953, which he won by a wheel's length to be crowned world champion.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/jb8Tkog6JQKQpDq3oKB5bGaCXLj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Ordinary Passenger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1210368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cabell Hopkins","original_name":"Cabell Hopkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e499251416c75151801","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2757420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jb8Tkog6JQKQpDq3oKB5bGaCXLj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
