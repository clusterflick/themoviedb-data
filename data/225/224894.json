A love story.  Drako Oho Zaraharzar can remember modeling for Salvador Dali and hanging out with The Stones. But he can’t remember yesterday.  Following a severe head injury, Drako Zaraharzar suffers from terrible memory loss, he can access memories from before his accident, but can’t imprint new ones. As he puts it, “the recording machine in my head doesn’t work”. Consequently, and as an antidote to depression he chose to live “completely in the now” according to the bizarre mottoes delivered to him whilst in a coma.","popularity":0.3878,"poster_path":"/4wtRSlGYayA43p0Pin387KQcAag.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Whose Mind Exploded","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Banwell","original_name":"Tony Banwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55958a98925141410b000114","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toby Amies","original_name":"Toby Amies","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/RIPUqcv5ySY6HOZa4CglFd9OzC.jpg","credit_id":"61923122458199004327ed70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toby Amies","original_name":"Toby Amies","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/RIPUqcv5ySY6HOZa4CglFd9OzC.jpg","credit_id":"61923129dbf1440092828a89","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483980,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Alexander","original_name":"Rob Alexander","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55958ac8c3a368146d0014e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2402602","wikidata_id":"Q18163355","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2TZBB7IukvPYieWXmesW1U1mDV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vHhuDhXXUkL4VDGl2EAwW2rr8Z0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4wtRSlGYayA43p0Pin387KQcAag.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1102,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6nQEZKyst21JZosPeT9vjWUDWDC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":331,"name":"tattoo"},{"id":6683,"name":"autobiography"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":170356,"name":"outsider"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
