The film documents activists, families and clergy on both sides of the campaign to legalize gay marriage and examines homophobia in the black community's institutional pillar-the black church and reveals the Christian right wing's strategy of exploiting this phenomenon in order to pursue an anti-gay political agenda. The New Black takes viewers into the pews and onto the streets and provides a seat at the kitchen table as it tells the story of the historic fight to win marriage equality in Maryland and charts the evolution of this divisive issue within the black community.","popularity":1.0595,"poster_path":"/aWF8CAku5WdP9AmrLxoRyu6ryAJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
