But it’s not that simple”, Christiane Hein states at the beginning of her film which follows seven-year-old Robert Becher from Erfurt in his struggle against excess pounds. The stages include a dieting sanatorium complete with “juice day”, humiliating physical education lessons at school and a visit to relatives in the country where Robert experiences a life without teasing and self-punishment. This is where the boy lets go – not easy when thoughts of weight fence one’s life in. Again and again, director Hein inserts scales as a symbolic image reminiscent of a guillotine-like torture instrument. A compassionate portrait.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Because I’m Fat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christiane Hein","original_name":"Christiane Hein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc3081b7d2bc100113bdfc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1989-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
