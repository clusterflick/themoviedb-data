Two children run away from home and discover an ancient underground network of monsoon drains, tunnels and caves. An army officer obsessed with order and discipline realises that life isnít so black and white. A painfully shy man reluctantly saves his neighbour and experiences a spiritual awakening.  Concocted from a heady mix of realism and poetic fantasy, Invisible Children is sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, but always thought-provoking.","popularity":0.192,"poster_path":"/jQivotBiuauk72wOFc8DpNotmsA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"愛を探すこどもたち","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1340263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Chia","original_name":"Kimberly Chia","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/yXGuczr7BaDFdJS8tu58RFFs5YU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dbfd6ccef488900171601af","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Gothong Tan","original_name":"Brian Gothong Tan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbfd61eef4889001716011c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Gothong Tan","original_name":"Brian Gothong Tan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbfd63bf1b5710013e868f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648299,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Gothong Tan","original_name":"Brian Gothong Tan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbfd62c9d893900183009ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Khoo","original_name":"Eric Khoo","popularity":0.1914,"profile_path":"/apvdm3PKZAcBtPTa6KGKhhsRWl3.jpg","credit_id":"5dbfd6749d89390018300a1c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2100552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rTx09GilojIbLIK1rVJBLOMWKT2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jQivotBiuauk72wOFc8DpNotmsA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":566},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nwolYYp5UJajlnJw4lr5LjNqOnM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":566},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":849,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8jDcu26uSLKZFDnxhujh2R1hUaW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Invisible Children Excerpt 001","key":"312680926","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-22T08:32:29.000Z","id":"5dbfe4a4f1b5710010e83073"}]}}}
