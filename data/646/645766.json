Typically for Johann, the work is a beautifully atmospheric composition, one that immerses the listener into the strange recordings of the ‘Numbers Stations’: a category of shortwave radio station broadcasts characterized by readings of number lists, letters and coded messages from a forgotten era. It is to these lost, lonely voices that Johan has turned, capturing the enigmatic transmission of encoded information to persons elsewhere, and reflecting them back within a new context.  In response, Studio AKA director Gergely Wootsch has created a considered and thoughtful animated film, which crosses literal boundaries and thresholds as it drifts along a desolate cold war landscape, following the haunting voice as it searches for a listener.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/rhmKJFC0m0b0TEg91CySFu7Muan.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12805,"logo_path":"/3XNVHv1ZHH7jZCcigFW8CWKCG8F.png","name":"Studio AKA","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Song For Europa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Craste","original_name":"Marc Craste","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/atZv9D4cdsQapkZXM6kLPmqleRs.jpg","credit_id":"5dc2ed9c470ead00138c2eca","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860449,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gergely Wootsch","original_name":"Gergely Wootsch","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2ed3499259c001879c1e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450789,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikki Kefford-White","original_name":"Nikki Kefford-White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2ed6099259c001879c296","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","original_name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/6TWdYn3opC6l5FBGACpTVbJn3yC.jpg","credit_id":"5dc2edbe99259c001879c2ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1746705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Weeden","original_name":"Anthony Weeden","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2ee38470ead00138c2f6c","department":"Sound","job":"Orchestrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","original_name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/6TWdYn3opC6l5FBGACpTVbJn3yC.jpg","credit_id":"5dc2edb1470ead00138c2edb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1746705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Weeden","original_name":"Anthony Weeden","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2edfea9b9a400111c25f7","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450792,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Godfrey Owen Roberts","original_name":"John Godfrey Owen Roberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2ee46a9b9a400111c2692","department":"Sound","job":"Orchestrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2588125,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William Eagar","original_name":"William Eagar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0895af5e12000038e93459","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Compositing Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1860449,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gergely Wootsch","original_name":"Gergely Wootsch","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6747af578bb84ab808cf7cc1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20279490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhmKJFC0m0b0TEg91CySFu7Muan.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson - A Song For Europa","key":"dCWbVxfkoKg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-11-29T16:00:04.000Z","id":"5dc2ecf5470ead00158c29a3"}]}}}
