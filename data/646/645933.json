Award-winning comedian Rich Hall explores the American dream and the dictum that came over with the very first pilgrims who set foot on Plymouth Rock - work hard and you will succeed. With his sharp wit and acerbic insight, Rich looks at how Americans strive to achieve this dream and how it's been explored and perpetuated by politicians, industrialists, artists, writers and film-makers.","popularity":0.2485,"poster_path":"/yHF70ZZXPNLxLjbmXpUsEUucage.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rich Hall's Working for the American Dream","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hall","original_name":"Rich Hall","popularity":0.4068,"profile_path":"/yhi9nbWKtgBrVXfAfFJAf18a6Y5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dc3c4728d22fc00143d8000","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Cottam","original_name":"Chris Cottam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8zeVrISbvgz5YD7OAWTBMBSTwhF.jpg","credit_id":"5dc3c4c48d22fc00183d6fab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hall","original_name":"Rich Hall","popularity":0.4068,"profile_path":"/yhi9nbWKtgBrVXfAfFJAf18a6Y5.jpg","credit_id":"5dc3c4e1470ead00158d698c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8681358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kiMSFk5EvEcWC9IIIyrK6yCcbPO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yHF70ZZXPNLxLjbmXpUsEUucage.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":1986,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWyM0YiqKVTclOrepfiKW7fThFY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
