The film's central event is the 1976 Mayoral election. Election scenes are intercut with comments from Haverhill residents, members of a local foundation, political scientist Frances Fox Piven, the president of the local union, and the shoe manufacturers themselves. The oral history which surrounds the election footage is a reservoir of information about Haverhill's present condition as well as its past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If It Fits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Marshall","original_name":"John Marshall","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/aN1Rt8npcoqDNiQsnz8Iis0WYCN.jpg","credit_id":"5dbf4a6e7d2bc1001136c0a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Erder","original_name":"Mark Erder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbf4a847d2bc1001736eef7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
