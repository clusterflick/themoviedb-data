But the filmmaker does not limit his remarks to a pure technical description, he does not forget the man nor his family and village environment, nor the history where his life was written at a given moment.  The director films Marcel Laforge, a blacksmith living in a small village in the Charentes, Garrat.  Shot in one week, the film is a reconstruction; everything has been staged from fragments of multiple realities. This short film is articulated around three themes, sometimes confronted, but often confused: the man, the history and the trade.","popularity":0.1316,"poster_path":"/gIKfAnTDrHiwFZdNtgldDVcylku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Farrier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Rouquier","original_name":"Georges Rouquier","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/i1QqoANQvPjCzCkJbbaeOGvwgZb.jpg","credit_id":"5dc10a259d8939001531710b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176974","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1487,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gIKfAnTDrHiwFZdNtgldDVcylku.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":991}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
