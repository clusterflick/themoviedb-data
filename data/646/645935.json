Instead, they spend their nights working—he in the market, she on the streets—or wandering restlessly and relentlessly around their dark, decaying city.  Writer/director Mauro Russo Rouge follows his characters as they drive down roads lit by the yellow glow of streetlights, push through the crowds at a pink-hued nightclub, pick up supplies in a glaringly bright supermarket, and meander down sidewalks with drinks in hand. They rarely emerge into the sunlight; most of the action takes place in claustrophobic indoor spaces or in the cold, gray light of dusk or dawn. So, too, do their expressions remain withdrawn—even when their nascent relationship triggers a decisive act of violence.","popularity":0.5172,"poster_path":"/6CQvy6HOLAxJFsw1HarDcaVHuZU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ira","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Cuccu","original_name":"Silvia Cuccu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"5dc3c522470ead00138d4b5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuele Maritan","original_name":"Samuele Maritan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Man","credit_id":"5dc3c53899259c00157b0930","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matteo Valier","original_name":"Matteo Valier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc3c56e8d22fc00183d70c9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauro Russo Rouge","original_name":"Mauro Russo Rouge","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/zxk1aGdtrfQXooZaIv4896tc6mO.jpg","credit_id":"5dc3c4fb99259c00187aea62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauro Russo Rouge","original_name":"Mauro Russo Rouge","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/zxk1aGdtrfQXooZaIv4896tc6mO.jpg","credit_id":"5dc3c506470ead00138d4b3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8495202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/6CQvy6HOLAxJFsw1HarDcaVHuZU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":549,"name":"prostitute"},{"id":924,"name":"italian"},{"id":6093,"name":"assault"},{"id":9840,"name":"romance"},{"id":9748,"name":"revenge"},{"id":259043,"name":"fringe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Denver Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
