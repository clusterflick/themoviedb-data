The Amis is the largest of many ethnic minorities in Taiwan officially recognised as indigenous peoples. In search of different spiritual practices belonging to the indigenous people of Makuta’ay, Yen-Chao Lin places the memories of the old Amis spirit keepers on an equal footing with the practices of Daoist rituals and Presbyterian burials, allowing personal prayers to resound and collective resistance to emerge. The Spirit Keepers of Makuta’ay was shot on Super 8 film and developed by the director by hand. The effects created during the development process add an additional layer of spiritual interpretation. A miniature, an essay, an impressionistic painting.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2q7gi9Hhe0SzFaV8hz15I3jJOoV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2019-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spirit Keepers of Makuta'ay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yen-Chao Lin","original_name":"Yen-Chao Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc014a59d893900133050d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448976,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yen-Chao Lin","original_name":"Yen-Chao Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc014b39d893900133050fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196019,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Emrys Lewis","original_name":"Oliver Emrys Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea51ebfec4552002140207d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10446100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":2095,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2q7gi9Hhe0SzFaV8hz15I3jJOoV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
