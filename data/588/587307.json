This reunion launches a voyage that immerses us in doubts over science and the way we see the world, as Julio and Cristian look for their beloved plants in remote forests. Through their work, the film shows us the importance of legacies, and the strength of that ancient bond between master and disciple. Their search also prompts a personal reflection on modern man’s obsession with controlling and mapping nature. In the diverse and nearly infinite world of the tropics, what is the point of counting plants forever?","popularity":0.0364,"poster_path":"/9H1Xy20WCRytceclAHITw03MSrA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91994,"logo_path":"/dpNrNeIraXp8GsOjVEqMOVipgyp.png","name":"Stank","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An expedition into the romantic world of science","title":"Homo Botanicus","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Betancur","original_name":"Julio Betancur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"605b0cedd5ffcb002a37926c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3022829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristian Castro","original_name":"Cristian Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"605b0d1b70b4440054544897","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc-Olivier Brullé","original_name":"Marc-Olivier Brullé","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605b0b8bb39e350028f75528","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022819,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillermo Quintero","original_name":"Guillermo Quintero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605b0c207dfda6006b25f1d4","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022819,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillermo Quintero","original_name":"Guillermo Quintero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605b0f9b22df2e0053b173c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8783194","wikidata_id":"Q66124349","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQXM6I5qmKlDbOgW8KgbtJ6BGPN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9H1Xy20WCRytceclAHITw03MSrA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Source: IMDB (Leipzig)","release_date":"2018-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
