However Harry Firth’s story is much more than just that.  Not only did he win the Armstrong 500 and Bathurst multiple times as a driver and team manager, he also won five manufacturer’s championships, four Australian rally championships, Round Australia Rallies and the Southern Cross Rally.  Add to that his influence on several great drivers, his involvement in the development of the Cortina GT 500, the Falcon GT and GTHO, the Torana XU1, L34 and A9X – all without any formal qualifications – and you have a true legend of Australian motor sport.  His is a unique story of determination, rare cunning and motor sport intuition.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cJ8xNNDWGa0Ai48rVo6d8Do0pTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fox: The Harry Firth Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":851,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cJ8xNNDWGa0Ai48rVo6d8Do0pTd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
