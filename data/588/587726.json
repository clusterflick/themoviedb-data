The home videos that follow show more highlights from her life: her first wedding anniversary, her daughters growing up, and the farewell party at the embassy. Meanwhile, the audio commentary offers a very different reality. The film's director María Silvia Esteve is the middle one of Silvia's daughters, and she and her siblings talk about their parents' gradual descent into a spiral of angry clashes, psychological problems and prescription drugs. By recounting events from their childhood, they try to get a handle on what went wrong in their family. And they wonder why their mother, with whom they had a very close relationship, never managed to improve the situation or leave their father.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/d0MjXcN54nXqK9hcuMFfDjgslmw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2018-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silvia","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2263925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Silvia Esteve","original_name":"María Silvia Esteve","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/iT9Ks7Qt7x68fB4BuTGjdVXlNuA.jpg","credit_id":"5c87fc730e0a260419c032d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2263925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Silvia Esteve","original_name":"María Silvia Esteve","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/iT9Ks7Qt7x68fB4BuTGjdVXlNuA.jpg","credit_id":"5f5ba8a6fd7aa4003bde7526","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2773844,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Esteve","original_name":"Carlos Esteve","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5ba8b5d8cc4a003ae977c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10433620","wikidata_id":"Q106149468","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0MjXcN54nXqK9hcuMFfDjgslmw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edcBVrcJrMiEZ1TTr9EysuNe2u3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Family Film Project","release_date":"2019-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
