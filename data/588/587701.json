When one spends a lot of time with wild animals it is hard not to find inspiration in the dignity and stoicism they display in the face of severe injury or death. This rabbit had a one-eyed sibling that is was very close to - they and their family are shown in happier times toward the end of this video. The events shown in this video happened over approximately two hours. These rabbits are relatively rare Appalachian Cottontails and live at near 4000 feet elevation in the Great Smokey Mountains of North Carolina.\" - Mr. C","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2ASQQuwYWQIKAeSeZrziQlcUpr7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comforting A Dying Rabbit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ASQQuwYWQIKAeSeZrziQlcUpr7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
