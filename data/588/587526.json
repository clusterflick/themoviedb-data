After a performance one night, she's mugged by a knife-wielding thief. The next day, in a clash with anti-abortion protesters in front of a woman's health clinic, Carmelita is arrested, along with her lively friend Orchida and her sort-of up-tight and wannabe-wealthy sister, Sophia. They're placed in a cell with another woman, who turns out to be last night's mugger, a down-and-out young woman named Cordelia (Dee). Relationships between each pair of women and among the four of them go through changes as the afternoon passes.","popularity":0.1423,"poster_path":"/mDGwEeaAu0lzK8kl6NQlws3Ng6d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmelita Tropicana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Carmelita Tropicana: Your Kunst Is Your Waffen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333151,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alina Troyano","original_name":"Alina Troyano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Carmelita Tropicana","credit_id":"5c86bc01c3a3684e8fe00d51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Ramos","original_name":"Sophia Ramos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sophia","credit_id":"5c86bc2c9251410d3616ffae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lanzillotto","original_name":"John Lanzillotto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kFGZ70Mi4YYJ2Lg6jIRcDLoKPah.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Righty","credit_id":"5c86bc4cc3a3687f84d3a92a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Iobst","original_name":"Anne Iobst","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dee","credit_id":"5c86bc75c3a3687f84d3aac0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Livia Daza-Paris","original_name":"Livia Daza-Paris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Orchidia","credit_id":"5c86bc92c3a368331bd0b6a1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636489,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Freddie Rodríguez","original_name":"Freddie Rodríguez","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612c05e5a4af8f00624fc12d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333151,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alina Troyano","original_name":"Alina Troyano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c86bb78925141649b16f53a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ela Troyano","original_name":"Ela Troyano","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/djJPoTvOzMbsU5p9JZMwkPYTEJg.jpg","credit_id":"5c86bb4d0e0a264301682b9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ela Troyano","original_name":"Ela Troyano","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/djJPoTvOzMbsU5p9JZMwkPYTEJg.jpg","credit_id":"5c86bb5f0e0a26765e5d89f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106520","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1546,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mDGwEeaAu0lzK8kl6NQlws3Ng6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1118}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1994-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
