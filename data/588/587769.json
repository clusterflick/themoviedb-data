The term iso is related to the ison of Byzantine church music and refers to the drone accompanying polyphonic singing. The drone is performed in two ways: among the Tosks, it is always continuous and sung on the syllable 'e', using staggered breathing, while among the Labs, the drone is sometimes sung as a rhythmic tone, performed to the text of the song. Rendered mainly by male singers, the music traditionally accompanies a wide range of social events, such as weddings, funerals, harvest feasts, religious celebrations and festivals such as the well-known Albanian folk festival in Gjirokastra.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Albanian Iso Polyphony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2264154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasil S.
