The framing story concerns a struggling novelist named Tim who has only a day or so to get over his writer’s block and finish his novel. His friend recommends an isolated cabin where Tim will be alone with nothing except a reading lamp and his laptop. And an alien demonic lobster, which promptly slices the top off Tim’s skull, removes his brain, and plugs its feelers into his frontal lobe. The lobster then proceeds to inject four stories directly into the brain which somehow help the lobotomised Tim to finish his novel.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mg50dQNa2cKowlpDtlflANuLCz0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forbidden Four","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2059633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Lee Rutter","original_name":"Thomas Lee Rutter","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c893f39c3a36864550bb580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2154188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1334,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mg50dQNa2cKowlpDtlflANuLCz0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
