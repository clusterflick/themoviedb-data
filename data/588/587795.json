Wise created dozens of brief animations using cut-outs, scratch-on-film techniques, as well as conventional cel animation. In 1963, at the age of eight, Wise released a compilation of his experiments, titled \"Short Circuit\". Distributed by the Filmmakers' Cooperative, \"Short Circuit\" was shown throughout the world, won several awards, and was the U.S. entry in the \"Child & the World\" festival in Czechoslovakia. Writing in the Village Voice, filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas called Wise \"the Mozart of Cinema.\"","popularity":0.1484,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Short Circuit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Wise","original_name":"David Wise","popularity":0.1547,"profile_path":"/eRJE41pLdtUOtGiqS0C2AewtEvY.jpg","credit_id":"609effb60f0da50078312951","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
