The film takes place both ashore and at sea, and sketches an image of the fishing district through a poetic glance at Marnix’ life. The East Shore in Ostend is the neighbourhood in which fishermen dwell: they weave nets, play cards and kill time. Now, this district is being demolished: high, white residential blocks are rising up instead. East Shore, the film, reflects this fragmented composition in its form: ashore, Marnix’ life is enacted in scenes impersonated by him and his fellows; at sea we look more indirectly, through shadows, silhouettes and reflections, at how life goes on.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oosteroever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2042605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quinten Wyns","original_name":"Quinten Wyns","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af9cee892514141a6000920","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
