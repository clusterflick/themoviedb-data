And they are the biggest group of animals in the world, outnumbering humans 200 million to one. Thanks to millions of years of evolution, these invertebrates not only survive in almost every landscape known to man, but also thrive by means of fascinating, and sometimes bizarre adaptations. There's the Bombardier beetle that squirts a boiling hot liquid from its anus, the Assassin bug that turns its victims into soup, and the Parasitic wasp that lays her eggs inside her victims, until her young are ready to eat their way out. We end off with the biggest bugs on the planet: the Atlas moth with a wingspan of over 20 centimetres, the Hercules beetle that can carry 850 times its own weight, and the Giant centipede - big enough to catch flying bats from midair!","popularity":0.4741,"poster_path":"/5b2VPlA769wCJScV9LMA8VgoaXi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"},{"id":78229,"logo_path":"/3s4Ycq1KmWxINaJWnXU6MMaptD5.png","name":"Earth Touch","origin_country":"ZA"},{"id":123631,"logo_path":"/1JidKUzFa41AfABFKCNBStylWcZ.png","name":"Smithsonian Networks","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incredible Insects","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"National Geographic Incredible Insects","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nat Geo Wild Incredible Insects","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Incredible Bugs","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Incredible Insects","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Freaks auf sechs Beinen - Unglaubliche Insekten","type":"TV-N24"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Pertwee","original_name":"Sean Pertwee","popularity":0.7091,"profile_path":"/j4pAEMhKL5vA61ADrkxxLFtcI4c.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host: Narrator (engl.)","credit_id":"5afc0b5e9251410757005766","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norbert Langer","original_name":"Norbert Langer","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/v7NIhXlwGB28VYirdIP605kfk6Z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Host: Narrator (german)","credit_id":"5edc7766f36a320020884bcb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graeme Duane","original_name":"Graeme Duane","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":"/tCYuW2wTvStTPDQtKpwTk4BBRmx.jpg","credit_id":"5c8247f792514127661c503a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6283702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lvGhkPgo2DPKC1D2fZ12drFzQDc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5b2VPlA769wCJScV9LMA8VgoaXi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/tLPdYUluPZb5aK7ztyvM8xyPBVd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
