The concert is presented in two parts. For part one, Anthrax performed the “favorites” that had been voted on pre-show by the band’s fans and includes gems like “Madhouse,” “Be All, End All,” “Breathing Lightning,” and “A.I.R.” The band augmented the stage production for part two, with ramps and staircases and other production values while they tore into their classic 1987 album Among The Living, performing “Caught In A Mosh,” “I Am the Law,” “Indians,” “Eflinikufesin (N.F.L.),” and more.  “It was a pretty intense show,” added guitarist Scott Ian, “especially when the crowd was so insane, the floor actually started moving up and down.”","popularity":0.1949,"poster_path":"/xPf0tKJfBndm6KiAzucvOYxHZEf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live from the sold out Barrowland Ballroom Glasgow 15-Feb-2017","title":"Anthrax: Kings Among Scotland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Ian","original_name":"Scott Ian","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/17EZYDZyp90zmcAFqvWa7Lp3KNl.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self / guitar","credit_id":"5afd0888c3a3687caa0036f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Benante","original_name":"Charlie Benante","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/rLbKOgIDuuqkMRVk9hjNTnJm9QK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self / drums","credit_id":"5afd08a20e0a262cab002feb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Bello","original_name":"Frank Bello","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/nGqD8VRHXiowQirZNrwSEyNOC6Y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self / bass","credit_id":"5afd08bd92514101f1002446","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Belladonna","original_name":"Joey Belladonna","popularity":0.2295,"profile_path":"/hL2iXvQKPT8U8qDbnXGzj8lxoFB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self / vocals","credit_id":"5afd0c0c92514101da003cc9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Donais","original_name":"Jonathan Donais","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self / guitar","credit_id":"5afd0ceac3a3687cad0032bc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul M.
