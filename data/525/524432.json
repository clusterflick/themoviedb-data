Dr Faust has foreseen this rise of evil. Unfortunately, he is near death and is unable to personally battle this upcoming threat. Faust entrusts a young boy, Shingo Yamada, to take the responsibility of ridding the Earth of this new evil presence. Faust finds a birthmark on Shingo's forehead that signifies that he is the chosen demon fighter. Faust also summons from hell what may be humanity's only hope of surviving: a less than enthusiastic devil named Mephisto rises. After signing a pact in blood to save humankind, Shingo and Mephisto set out to battle the supernatural world.","popularity":0.5472,"poster_path":"/icXpy0zTWyIfL7Riuaw21n0CjDC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil Boy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Akuma-kun","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4586053,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isao Takahashi","original_name":"Isao Takahashi","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ef592985702e01626c6185","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shigeru Mizuki","original_name":"水木しげる","popularity":0.2327,"profile_path":"/3wlLohlrYCtZfGe2jH9OQCl4KfF.jpg","credit_id":"5b2b4e890e0a26085d00331b","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1255663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yoshiyuki Suga","original_name":"菅良幸","popularity":0.3528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2b4eaa0e0a260851003aa9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Junichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤順一","popularity":0.5547,"profile_path":"/ckKxvO5rmHG9nh4ZarKffR3iYUv.jpg","credit_id":"5b2b4dfbc3a3687d23003e1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nozomi Aoki","original_name":"青木望","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2b4e6d0e0a26084a003938","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601673,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kinichirou Suzuki","original_name":"Kinichirou Suzuki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2b4f390e0a26085d003370","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12956918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/h7Mz6DfWsc7OFSgmGqZVFHHOIHV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/icXpy0zTWyIfL7Riuaw21n0CjDC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1989-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
