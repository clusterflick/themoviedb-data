He is poet Knuts Skujenieks, an exceptional personality not only in Latvia, but also within an international context, whose difficult struggle with the totalitarian regime reflects the true value of selfless work and unbending stance. The story, with its undercurrent of true humanity, allows a glimpse through Knuts Skujenieks’ life onto each of our fates.","popularity":0.1592,"poster_path":"/thhB7BC8FLW4JwFScoL6fICe0QC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mojo Raiser Production","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2017-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knutifiction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907725,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Knuts Skujenieks","original_name":"Knuts Skujenieks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gxOgFhMOg6cUuxsvb4FZHaxqiA1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fe3edb31ac292003fb78838","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Tontegode","original_name":"Ivars Tontegode","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/pn4kIdxXAqmFdZd0mLmWeqDpzfA.jpg","credit_id":"5afda51f9251412659005b6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guna Stahovska","original_name":"Guna Stahovska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3eebe72d855003ec2876d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973138,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Reinfelds","original_name":"Jānis Reinfelds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3ee5beb79c2003c45f13c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","original_name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3eedc5be00e003d9f464c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gunta Bāriņa","original_name":"Gunta Bāriņa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3eeab8a0e9b003d0bd7cf","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","original_name":"Jevgenijs Načiss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3ee840d417e003d4e4f70","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2044645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Tontegode","original_name":"Ivars Tontegode","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/pn4kIdxXAqmFdZd0mLmWeqDpzfA.jpg","credit_id":"5fe3ee49d70594003efe9b54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700326,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Evija Džonsone","original_name":"Evija Džonsone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3ee6f1d6c5f003fdac6e5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700475,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gunta Ikere","original_name":"Gunta Ikere","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3ee97cee481003e262ba9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6992072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"fb.com","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/thhB7BC8FLW4JwFScoL6fICe0QC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
