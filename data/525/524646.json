The film follows the trials and tribulations of Jewish refugee Shlomo Vollmus, played by Avraham Doryon. Finally able to legally emigrate to the Holy Land, Shlomo joins a Jewish settlement and sets about to make himself a vital part of his new community. With the exception of Doryon, the cast is comprised of nonprofessionals, none of whom speak on-camera. For the benefit of English-speaking audiences, narration is provided by radio actors Mason Adams (later \"Charlie Hume\" on TV's Lou Grant) and Ann Shepherd.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream No More","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938940,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Krumgold","original_name":"Joseph Krumgold","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afcb0b8c3a3687c910004ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
