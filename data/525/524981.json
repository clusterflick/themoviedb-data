It had been hanging about there for a few weeks before I decided to listen to it. There you are, carefully cellotaped in the correct order of the editing rushes, claps, cuts and wrong frames of a film I donâ€™t know anything about. That soudtrack immediatly appealed to me. Its discontinuary and fragmentary aspect, nevertheles made sense, was a sort of transcription in the world of sounds of what had been so for visual in my other films. Moreover, its contents made of sentences or scenes only just introduced or repeated, of questions about identity and the body, the coming in and out of the characters, scenes of seduction and violence, all that mixture permanently interrupted by the unknown director that give his orders : \"Ready ! Motor ! Action !\" in short, all this gave the film a mysterious and imaginary atmosphere.\"\r Christian Lebrat (Dedicated to Marcel Duchamp)","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/b4llCMe81YfPaPKKD900Un28h33.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1985-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Moteur de l'Action (A.M.D)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Lebrat","original_name":"Christian Lebrat","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/kPcuflAUXhLRBkyQstPFlzxBe6V.jpg","credit_id":"5afef61692514178b100809b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5373380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1095,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4llCMe81YfPaPKKD900Un28h33.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Scratch projection","release_date":"1985-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
