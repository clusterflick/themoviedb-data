There, like a transcriber of the middle ages, he diligently cares for the rare and forgotten plant seeds to create a variety of so-called “old futures.” Patrice dreams up his garden and turns his crops into art projects. Over time, and with patience, he passes on his passion and his knowledge to us through his seed bank. These seeds of life will appear in thousands of gardens throughout the world. An ode to plant biodiversity and to our heritage, brought forth by a true and genetically motivated sower.","popularity":0.082,"poster_path":"/9Iz7sLWoDhMnEumRimaCxR7aJmo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44810,"logo_path":"/fwnOlu3T5VrgVWruS7rck7tWprC.png","name":"Les Films du 3 Mars","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":29201,"logo_path":"/93Cu4sHMvJLgCwk9wpQY5xrb3XA.png","name":"Les Films de L'Autre","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2042181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrice Fortier","original_name":"Patrice Fortier","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5af8f74ac3a368104c00623f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2042180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Perron","original_name":"Julie Perron","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af8f7220e0a263ef1004b77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2042180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Perron","original_name":"Julie Perron","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af8f80492514170630014d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3521874","wikidata_id":"Q64864019","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Iz7sLWoDhMnEumRimaCxR7aJmo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":644}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Hot Docs 2014, Toronto","release_date":"2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Le Semeur de Julie Perron","key":"t3onmF6loYs","published_at":"2018-04-18T19:33:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5af8efe60e0a263eca004995"}]}}}
