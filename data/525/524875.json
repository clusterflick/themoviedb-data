The beauty, heritage and emotion of the Chu Nom characters inspire Zenei’s art. The film also examines Vietnam’s culture, history, customs, and the social impact of rapid modernization in a changing world.  Art of Nom follows Zenei through their research and explorations that takes them far off the beaten path. They enter hidden library chambers of Buddhist pagodas to examine original Nom scriptures and woodblocks preserved by monks through the centuries. Led by renowned artist Le Quoc Viet, Zenei is a collective of avant-garde calligraphers forging a new path, merging contemporary visual expression with a nearly extinct script. Zenei elevates art and history to a new level of experience.","popularity":0.3179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Nôm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Le Quoc Viet","original_name":"Le Quoc Viet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5afe4dcc0e0a26246c003046","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tran Trong Duong","original_name":"Tran Trong Duong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5afe4de592514178a0002e1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyen Quang Thang","original_name":"Nguyen Quang Thang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5afe4df20e0a26246f0030da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pham Van Tuan","original_name":"Pham Van Tuan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5afe4e030e0a26246c003066","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyen Duc Dung","original_name":"Nguyen Duc Dung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5afe4e140e0a262484003642","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Perna","original_name":"Bill Perna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afe4d6fc3a368747c004d4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2956,"name":"vietnam"},{"id":1731,"name":"writing"},{"id":5996,"name":"language"},{"id":167234,"name":"vietnamese"},{"id":228695,"name":"east asia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Source: https://bit.ly/2IL7HbM","release_date":"2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
