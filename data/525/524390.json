It is both her haven and her prison, a whiskey-yellow fantasy where nothing changes and everything is familiar. Her job as a cleaner allows her unlimited assess to the lives of the guests. She steals pieces of the outside world from them, creating a window of escape out of the broken, used and discarded objects that get left behind. A flash of red, a pair of wonderful stilettos, has the power to change everything. Marie has come to the Roadside motel. Dorothy is a story about two women struggling to between different stages of their lives. It is a quiet film, visually sensual, that explores the hard edge of fantasy and womanhood and the inevitability of change.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wcoV5sfiop8Lxdbshn0poIFFTLp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nicholas Suter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gilett","original_name":"Daniel Gilett","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"61e51cd5c613ce004224020c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2918260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tilly Ozsdolay","original_name":"Tilly Ozsdolay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rico","credit_id":"61e51d09fdc4fa0069aedf27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Richards","original_name":"Whitney Richards","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"61e51d2f904f6d0066e0e576","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2918383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Summer Williams","original_name":"Summer Williams","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7jB7GMvEqVUcbNb5f0M1CfyOO27.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"61e51d5f534661008ce632dd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jasmine Marie Adams","original_name":"Jasmine Marie Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e51c5d1065d30041df2d58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jess Fogarty","original_name":"Jess Fogarty","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e51c9ffdc4fa004006a344","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1003271","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wcoV5sfiop8Lxdbshn0poIFFTLp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
