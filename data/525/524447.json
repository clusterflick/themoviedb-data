For centuries past the Innu had followed a seasonal migration cycle, wintering in the northern territories for the caribou hunt and returning every summer to the north shore of the St-Lawrence. Festivities, meetings, traditional games and weddings marked the latter period, and the Festival has become the modern day reincarnation of the ancient summer celebration.","popularity":0.3066,"poster_path":"/dau7PZ7P6JnvP4YVpigB0WClkzX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104613,"logo_path":"/oQFsGgUZK1C5Lk5FXtQevYKHqSu.png","name":"Terre
