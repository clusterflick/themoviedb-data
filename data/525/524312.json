When the car accelerates the pig turns at different speeds, while the voice of Residente Calle 13, a young reggaetón singer from Puerto Rico, addresses the viewer in Spanish. He draws on examples of non-human social organizations, such as those among bats, termites, and ants, for possible alternative modes of being-in-common and describes a possible path for contemporary experience. The world he describes is an antagonistic state of order and disorder, civility and barbarity, in an age of armed globalization.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweat Glands, Sweat Lands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Allora","original_name":"Jennifer Allora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afaba060e0a263b9e00908d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillermo Calzadilla","original_name":"Guillermo Calzadilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afaba11c3a3680e8000bab9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
