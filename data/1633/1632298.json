Documenting the band’s first-ever live performance of Normal Isn’t, the film features an entirely new stage setup, new costumes, and a graphic-rich light show. As tracks like “Self Evident,” and “Pendulum” pulse through the building’s granite-lined interior, Maynard James Keenan, Carina Round, and Mat Mitchell deliver a visceral, high-energy performance that brings the album to life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puscifer - Normal Isn't Live at the Pacific Stock Exchange","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
