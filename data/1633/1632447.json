Zita Kelmickaitė was one such person. This is a journey to Lithuania in the 1980s and 1990s, when the revival of folk songs became a silent weapon and an important part of the road to independence. Using previously unseen archival material and the voice of Zita Kelmickaitė herself, the film reveals not only the phenomenon of her personality, but also the history of an entire generation that cherished national identity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/e5Jcb0p1bEgBLwuNgQHyawToZDw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2026-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zitai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5787734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zita Kelmickaitė","original_name":"Zita Kelmickaitė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698a9555487194b9561e6177","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas V.
