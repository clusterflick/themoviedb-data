What begins as a coincidence quickly spirals into obsession when the prediction starts coming true in unsettling ways.  As he hunts for the mysterious fortune teller behind the broadcast, he uncovers a hidden organization that doesn’t foresee death — it engineers it. A secret group that believes the world only changes when prominent figures fall at precisely the right moment.  Trapped between fame, paranoia, and a fate millions are watching unfold, he must decide whether to run from his destiny or confront it on the biggest stage imaginable.  Set against the spectacle of the Super Bowl, PROMINENT is a psychological thriller about fear, control, and how belief itself can turn prophecy into reality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the world expects your fall, escape is impossible.","title":"Prominent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
