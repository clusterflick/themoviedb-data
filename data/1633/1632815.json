The film examines the living conditions of its inhabitants, shaped by economic, cultural, and racial tensions. Migration processes, the concentration of land ownership in few hands, the lack of incentives for production, and the persistence of traditional organizational structures reveal a landscape marked by social conflict and stagnation. Through an austere mise-en-scène and a dark, nearly static visual language, the film offers a critical portrait of the everyday life of a mestizo community pushed to the margins of development.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t3OGJAN0LopHtdOXHBwzp7J3q1m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boca de Lobo, Simiatug","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Khalifé","original_name":"Raúl Khalifé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b5e0a6dd2b98900d7f469","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999194,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susana Andrade","original_name":"Susana Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b5e68a1a69fe805b24faa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t3OGJAN0LopHtdOXHBwzp7J3q1m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Boca de Lobo, Simiatug - Raúl Khalifé - 1982","key":"RBLdrQUPyKM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-28T23:00:08.000Z","id":"698b5eeae7c65c4b34b70eb5"}]}}}
