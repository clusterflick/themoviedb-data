Through time, patience and non-obtrusive observation, he begins to learn the incredible majesty of the often-unnoticed cultures we co-exist with: creatures with their own sets of rules.  Yet just as he is being drawn into the beauty of these newly-discovered lives, curiosity turns to drama, as Nature - indifferent, powerful, irrepressible – inflicts an unexpected challenge, endangering the lives and very existence of the animals the filmmaker has spent so many years earning the trust and companionship of.  As the intertwined lives of animals and humans navigate together an incomprehensible crisis, all will be transformed. Will each survive? At what cost? And how can they move into the future together, with the knowledge of each other that they now share?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Rivière Au Bout De Mon Jardin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A River at the Bottom of My Garden","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1942121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillaume Mazille","original_name":"Guillaume Mazille","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698b9c68a4aa32e01b8efda9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1942121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillaume Mazille","original_name":"Guillaume Mazille","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b9bf939e197d0f31e660a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1942121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillaume Mazille","original_name":"Guillaume Mazille","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b9c0c1db70d7fe38efdee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1942121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillaume Mazille","original_name":"Guillaume Mazille","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b9c1cf2a36e6da1b71087","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jade Maitre","original_name":"Jade Maitre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b9c7fbdbcf07785b2503f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
