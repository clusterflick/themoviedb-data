One of the only troop of its kind in the nation, this all-refugee scouting troop is a beacon of hope for refugees in the area. The troop was chartered by Dr. P.J. Parmar ten years ago, who also runs Mango House – the largest shared space for refugees in the greater West. The charter is with Scouting BSA (formerly Boy Scouts of America) and serves refugees in the greater Denver area, all at no cost to the members, many of whom recently fled war, conflict and areas in duress.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Refuge of Scouting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Taylor","original_name":"Ross Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b9ed7da8fe4a4b1421847","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Clark","original_name":"Pat Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b9efdef063c5d7bb71199","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
