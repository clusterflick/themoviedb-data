The work approaches the site through the lens of geo-anatomy — the earth as body, mother, and sentient presence — drawing on feminist cosmologies that reimagine landscape as kin. Shot on Super 8mm and interwoven with field recordings, the film employs the camera as a somatic tool, an extension of embodied experience, to explore how memory, ritual, and myth are inscribed in place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great mound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katrina Niebergal","original_name":"Katrina Niebergal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b412546c1d1e073b24eb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
