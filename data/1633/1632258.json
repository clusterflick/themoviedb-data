He shares anecdotes from fatherhood, insights from travel, and tackles dress-code trauma and rental car disputes with a playful spirit that is both sharp and silly. He continues his tradition of offering untraditional ways to purchase the special, including packages that come with politically confusing magnetic bumper stickers, a small framed and autographed piece of Japanese siding from his house, a custom obituary, and a commemorative plate with a royal title. The New York Times writes, “Mirman’s stand-up is infused with a warm and cheerful sense of the ridiculous,” while Mike Birbiglia once called Eugene the “Andy Warhol of comedy.” Eugene is confident that this is the last comedy special you’ll watch (if you take poison right after).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dhJsoElHzdyi23RGtKOWDEDKJF5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":288788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pretty Good Friends","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eugene Mirman: Here Comes The Whimsy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Mirman","original_name":"Eugene Mirman","popularity":0.7717,"profile_path":"/rtEboZ6GqxV5hmYrlyhUTwU2v5J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698a26a2ac87c9409faee293","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2222769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Smith Clem","original_name":"Julie Smith Clem","popularity":0.5138,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a28c6e86528b674cb0b0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2222769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Smith Clem","original_name":"Julie Smith Clem","popularity":0.5138,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a28d4e86528b674cb0b12","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Mirman","original_name":"Eugene Mirman","popularity":0.7717,"profile_path":"/rtEboZ6GqxV5hmYrlyhUTwU2v5J.jpg","credit_id":"698a28e3f0a9c4ac45a2f610","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Mirman","original_name":"Eugene Mirman","popularity":0.7717,"profile_path":"/rtEboZ6GqxV5hmYrlyhUTwU2v5J.jpg","credit_id":"698a2900171fa43326cb0b21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a8YMGKacTPiXYeKjdofRD8aUYsJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dhJsoElHzdyi23RGtKOWDEDKJF5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
