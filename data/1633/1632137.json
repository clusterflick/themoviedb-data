This album is a compilation of stories that we could all relate to, but it doesn't dwell on sadness and anguish; it offers us solutions to the very problems the project raises, stemming from what Milo was questioning about what was happening in his own life. Like all good things in life, its greatness is very hard to put into words, but in this documentary, we will test ourselves and see what this project has to teach us and why it is not just another album.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La vida era más corta: el documental","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo J","original_name":"Milo J","popularity":0.212,"profile_path":"/t562SbCSyKol89E99mT06Nlaw1p.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6989ed0c6c26679a2ff81675","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5996835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramiro Weileras","original_name":"Ramiro Weileras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6989ecce463acfd0c52cf136","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5996835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramiro Weileras","original_name":"Ramiro Weileras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6989ecd97f8c7ebda58e746f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5996835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramiro Weileras","original_name":"Ramiro Weileras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6989ece4b7e59d42c2f818a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5996835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ramiro Weileras","original_name":"Ramiro Weileras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6989ecf44bc7cc6b65c1d218","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
