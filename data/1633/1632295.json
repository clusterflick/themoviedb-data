First, absorbed in his smartphone, ignores Second, who is desperate for attention and connection. Their unspoken struggle intensifies around a lonely beach swing—an object that becomes both a symbol of longing and a stage for laughter, frustration, and provocation.  Through silence, gestures, and mood shifts, Swing explores our modern obsession with technology, the ache of isolation, and the quiet drama of human interaction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dGzIKR6WkBPOKYec2UbVOGpv2cg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Гойдалки","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2403693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitalii Azhnov","original_name":"Віталій Ажнов","popularity":0.6207,"profile_path":"/cFIOQSvCxowgG0X44cYfikodItd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"698a35d2c592e8a00abb8288","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taras Tsymbaliuk","original_name":"Тарас Цимбалюк","popularity":0.9204,"profile_path":"/8LnHu9vG1cnqjyfkcJ0TELnhHFg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"698a35dd301f23d62baee2f7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5997419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhii Malyk","original_name":"Serhii Malyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a3605a8f8512c83018269","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dGzIKR6WkBPOKYec2UbVOGpv2cg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
