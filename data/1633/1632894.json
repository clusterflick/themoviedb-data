In 1984, in the Lake District, Gill Price and Jill Lawrence were filmed climbing Empire E3 6a at Raven Crag, Thirlmere, for a Channel 4 program, Lakeland Rock, with Chris Bonington, broadcast on Channel 4 on 25 May 1985. This event marked a turning point in British women's climbing, as few, if any, women appeared on television climbing difficult sport routes.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/bzci3OsbKyTTjX0FG9pkI7QEtlz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227187,"logo_path":"/3TVlJu90mXOweK0bdwwCoPLGGtE.png","name":"Border Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raven Crag - Closing The Gap","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5995833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jill Lawrence","original_name":"Jill Lawrence","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/pLUYp9Mwzu4UzbL8lLI2EcOBjsQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698b9c11a4aa32e01b8efda4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5995830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gill Price","original_name":"Gill Price","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/nAYIsACxoo8EZCv2G0an6ilUQaR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698b9c245bfb1e76c6c733ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Bonington","original_name":"Chris Bonington","popularity":0.5397,"profile_path":"/eypfdbVk3YvWMeq58o2FgnXac8q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"698b9c46d43ff051d3d7f6d6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1578746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Berriff","original_name":"Paul Berriff","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/9k9UikOIH2hyKcPdMuWaxIASM6L.jpg","credit_id":"698b9bd9c7fd01ff10c733cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39773372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qQJzrKlyKcA1MgmLcR4OzuZU7Jn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lK9Io4Lzo7TVBhhjEifmfzyruMb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzci3OsbKyTTjX0FG9pkI7QEtlz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197623,"name":"free climbing"},{"id":305490,"name":"women climbers"},{"id":313984,"name":"uk climber"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":359204,"name":"climbing history"},{"id":367401,"name":"climbing pioneers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Raven Crag - Closing The Gap (1985)","key":"8EPzeJl-FMQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-22T03:00:36.000Z","id":"698ba00b38b74d826fb2502a"}]}}}
