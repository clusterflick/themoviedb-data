The camera follows the seven-mile-long Lemmenjoki River from its mouth to its headwaters. A poetic, handsomely shot short film from a time when the Lemmenjoki River was a free and wild region. The gold rush of the late 1940s was ahead. \"The unbroken peace of Lapland surrounds us. Here, on the edge of the fells, the population of Lapland lives its own quiet, isolated life, rising contentedly to its daily toil, unaware of the disputes and escapades of the civilized world.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21046,"logo_path":"/ghVwr2Y0DgRbg3b4Mm3FVdhJ6Fo.png","name":"Suomi-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1940-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lemmenjoki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10173472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"1940-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
