Valve Janov, Kaja Kärner, Silvia Jõgever, Lembit Saarts, Lüüdia Vallimäe-Mark and Heldur Viires were the first generation of artists who grew out of the Pallas spirituality, who missed out on the usual opportunity for self-improvement in Paris due to the outbreak of World War II. Instead, Saarts, Viires and Sooster spent the years 1949–1956 in Soviet prison camps. The story about a group of friends, made up of very different personalities, is outlined in long, calm monologues. The memory fragments of elderly artists form a complete story about the fate of an artistic generation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tartu sõpruskond - kunsti saab igal ajal teha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
