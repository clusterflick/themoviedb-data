Navigating a twilight terrain, they encounter a layered constellation of Irish history, folklore, literature, and music, drifting from pagan myth to contemporary political memory, including the Troubles. The work unfolds as a dreamlike traversal of the island’s subconscious, where temporalities overlap and multiple narratives coexist without resolution.  The landscapes of Benign Land are composed from 3D photogrammetry models captured by the artist across Ireland. Sites associated with myth, industry, politics, and literature are dismantled and reassembled into speculative terrains, navigable via controller. As viewers move through these environments, shifting perspectives and plural histories emerge, foregrounding the instability of place, memory, and national narrative.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benign Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999035,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John D’Arcy","original_name":"John D’Arcy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b3e40da8807cbde823149","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999036,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Anna Chocholi","original_name":"Anna Chocholi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b3e53f18f798eebb24f20","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5999072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandros Ntolas","original_name":"Leandros Ntolas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698b43c82a1fad320cc732c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14985,"name":"ireland"},{"id":230977,"name":"the troubles (north ireland, 1966-98)"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
