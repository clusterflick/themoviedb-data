What begins as a path toward rehabilitation slowly reveals itself as a deeper struggle: not just freedom from prison walls, but from the weight of grief, addiction, and community threats that shadow him outside. Moving between the rigid order of Magilligan Prison, the chaos of life beyond its gates, and the open fields where cycles of life renew, the film asks whether Ryan can ever find peace—or if he remains trapped between worlds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magilligan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
