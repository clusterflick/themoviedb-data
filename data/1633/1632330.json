Sarah and Don, on their third date, are melting in each other's gaze. When she goes to powder her nose, a brisk salesman sits down next to Don. He's Phil, selling insurance for a broken heart. Soon Don is actually interested in the terms of the contract: counseling, a cook provided for six months, replacement of any albums lost in event of breakup. There's wardrobe consultation, patented lines to feed your friends so they won't think you blew it, and, to clinch the deal, Phil's company, Mutual Love Life, provides a loaner. But, before Don can sign on the dotted line, Sarah comes back from the ladies' room with something on her mind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mutual Love Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Christopherson","original_name":"Kathy Christopherson","popularity":0.6262,"profile_path":"/wvECK0vDsHM8XtD1nsYVBKnelly.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"698a43f92b2f348127338577","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt McCoy","original_name":"Matt McCoy","popularity":2.19,"profile_path":"/4VkRnRc7h4JatbBKZMEQV7n4w0R.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Don","credit_id":"698a4402406df9f05d33857d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Peters","original_name":"Robert Peters","popularity":0.8227,"profile_path":"/ub1u7ydCng5T71w1gtHfH3KC2Hl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Phil Shucky","credit_id":"698a440f3802106496a2f697","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Lamond","original_name":"Andrew Lamond","popularity":0.3693,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"698a441a27f56638240183e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Petty","original_name":"Danielle Petty","popularity":2.3604,"profile_path":"/c5WgxVhJCJSBU2e9WyDgG2bU1fa.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Shelly","credit_id":"698a4424d6f71c1b23aee38d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Peters","original_name":"Robert Peters","popularity":0.8227,"profile_path":"/ub1u7ydCng5T71w1gtHfH3KC2Hl.jpg","credit_id":"698a4369f5ab7195748f1552","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Peters","original_name":"Robert Peters","popularity":0.8227,"profile_path":"/ub1u7ydCng5T71w1gtHfH3KC2Hl.jpg","credit_id":"698a436edc55e73c8c8b2186","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Peters","original_name":"Robert Peters","popularity":0.8227,"profile_path":"/ub1u7ydCng5T71w1gtHfH3KC2Hl.jpg","credit_id":"698a437827f56638240183cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":61381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sue Bea Montgomery","original_name":"Sue Bea Montgomery","popularity":0.3843,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a43892ca9edd85f018325","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2194271,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Scilla Andreen","original_name":"Scilla Andreen","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a4396406df9f05d338560","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87618,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian Crane","original_name":"Brian Crane","popularity":0.5236,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a43e47a50a5b84c8b20d0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0211533","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
