A granddaughter sets out to trace her grandfather's footsteps. She saw him often, but they never really met. At 91, Réal Arsenault has a life worth telling. A painter who left his mark on the history of contemporary art in Quebec, he was also very active in politics, working alongside supporters of a free and independent Quebec. This film will pay tribute to his life and his art, but it will also question what we leave behind on Earth, the legacy we pass on to our children and grandchildren, and the importance of communication within a family.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"La couleur de Réal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2220004,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Barbara Arsenault","original_name":"Barbara Arsenault","popularity":1.8724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698a012064311b4bc9c1cfd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2026-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
