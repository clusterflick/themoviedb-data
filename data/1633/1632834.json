The VIII Olympiad showcased the grandeur of the Opening Ceremony and looks at the challenges faced in organizing the event. The beautifully shot footage (bearing in mind that it was 100 years ago) vividly captures the electrifying atmosphere of the Games, the athletes and provides insights into the meticulous preparations. The 1924 Games was the first-ever to be shot on film, and the original film was digitized and restored, and re-edited with a modern audience in mind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lT5Lb6t6UUHKoYFA2cDjkrdjsD1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"PARIS 1924 celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Games which returned to Paris in 2024.","title":"Paris 1924: An Olympic Epic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32330290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lT5Lb6t6UUHKoYFA2cDjkrdjsD1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
