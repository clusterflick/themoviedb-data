Ferry had some awesome help from a sexy female saxophonist who added both in terms of sound and stage presence. He played many of his former band’s most famous hits while also digging into a cover of John Lennon’s “Jealous Guy”. Ferry had the largest gathering of middle-aged Coachella participants of any Friday act, but it was surprising how many younger fans showed up on their own to see the legendary Ferry. Though many probably stuck around to hear Roxy Music hit “More Than This”, songs like “Oh Yeah” and “Avalon” even had those folks feeling as though they got much more than their money’s worth on Friday.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/d16NSsZ8FivcMkpPgynrx2BtPI6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bryan Ferry Coachella Live","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d16NSsZ8FivcMkpPgynrx2BtPI6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
