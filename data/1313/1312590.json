Filmic images are content to quietly watch and listen and wait. And they expect the same of how they are observed. In other words an immanence of nature confiding a secret. This involves movements that are visible, and more importantly audible, though they are not conspicuous in an ordered existence. Possible reasons are that they are too insignificant and evidence too little form, an insufficient amount of purpose. However, alternations, even metamorphoses take place, and they tell their own stories, of those occasional events that do not include humankind, which are fully independent of it.","popularity":0.0746,"poster_path":"/jmmhecVUfa4oivQpgO1jHZtJvAb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rising Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Marxt","original_name":"Lukas Marxt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66866e879e518db05b1bdd27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jmmhecVUfa4oivQpgO1jHZtJvAb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
