It is a journey marked by blood, sweat, tears, unwavering commitment, and personal sacrifices, revealing that being an anti- poaching ranger is far more than just a job-it's a calling. In this era of heightened poaching activities targeting iconic species like rhinos and elephants, these anti-poaching rangers have evolved into frontline defenders, and have become more like military units in some regions. Their unwavering bravery and dedication shine through as they act as the last line of defence between ruthless poachers and the precious wildlife they seek to exploit. These remarkable individuals are emerging as unsung heroes of conservation, and are standing steadfast to protect what remains of rhino populations. Their stories serve as a testament to the human spirit in the face of ecological crisis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Follow the journey of recruits within the non-profit organization, Global Conservation Force, as they undergo rigorous training and transform into anti-poaching rangers to safeguard our planet's most vulnerable and endangered species.","title":"Holding the Frontline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jess Donnelly","original_name":"Jess Donnelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686dd52214689cbf33351fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31022660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
