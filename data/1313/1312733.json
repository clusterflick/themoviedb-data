His three grown children and daughter-in-law have shown him over the years how to be more accepting of other people, how to be a more open and loving man, and how to stay with the times both socially and technologically. Without his wife for so long, he decides it's time to not live alone anymore so he tells his family he's planning on finding a roommate online. This naturally concerns them due to his age and they fear someone might come to the house and hurt him or otherwise take advantage, so they stage an intervention to talk him out of it. But when they are all there, their own personal prejudices and shortcomings are revealed and it all starts to unravel pretty fast. And when they find out the reality of what their dad actually has going on, it forces them all to re-examine what they truly feel as opposed to what they say they do.","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":232979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devarez Films","origin_country":""},{"id":232980,"logo_path":null,"name":"Otterdam Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dad's New Roommate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Drew","original_name":"Heather Drew","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Margaret Kowalski-Bennett","credit_id":"6686ca27dc7a9accc91a705d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2577994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meaghan Bloom Fluitt","original_name":"Meaghan Bloom Fluitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Elsie Bennett","credit_id":"6686ca766f445beb10c1aabd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3678100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew J.
