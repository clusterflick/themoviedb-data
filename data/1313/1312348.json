A critical reading of archives is thus required to tell the stories that are not documented. The film appropriates a concept developed by Ariella Aïsha Azoulay to narrate the ‘potential history’ of Francesc Tosquelles, a Catalan psychiatrist and refugee from the Spanish civil war who ran a provincial hospital in France during the Nazi occupation. Revolutionary politics from the 1930s opened the way to revolutionizing therapy.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/bKPrQgXQfBUPSgx4tdpa5jUUFCa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Potential History of Francesc Tosquelles, Catalonia and Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mireia Sallarés","original_name":"Mireia Sallarés","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6685ad96dc7a9accc91a4a1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mireia Sallarés","original_name":"Mireia Sallarés","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6685ad9cc001490b743b2f91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4809054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joana Masó","original_name":"Joana Masó","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6685adacfeec89abe3026f6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":891,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bKPrQgXQfBUPSgx4tdpa5jUUFCa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
