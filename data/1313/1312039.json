Employing the services of an animation studio in Pyongyang, North Korea, Ho Tzu Nyen’s work reinterprets scenes of political uprising and mass demonstration as depicted in South Korean narrative film and television. The project aims to form a direct relationship between South Korea’s political history and the tensions that still define the country’s relationship with its northern counterpart. The result is, in the artist’s words, a “game of exquisite corpse across geopolitical barriers.” The artist developed the experimental soundtrack in collaboration with Korean artists and musicians Bek Hyunjin, Park Minhee, and Ryu Hankil. Offering two vocal renditions of texts from the forty-ninth hexagram of the I-Ching, an ancient Chinese divination manual, the soundtrack composites historical interpretation with translation to speak of revolution and renewal.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/zQwOJ7xCyPpzIBwg1dbkSTzI5xX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KP","name":"North Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 49th Hexagram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Tzu Nyen","original_name":"Ho Tzu Nyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684d83ca1784ec9b1331ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQwOJ7xCyPpzIBwg1dbkSTzI5xX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hammer Projects: Ho Tzu Nyen","key":"W3au5ptIlfw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-04T19:34:06.000Z","id":"6684d996878c5d9cf375ee42"}]}}}
