It blends fact and fiction, using classic B-movie monsters as the basis for real investigations. The humor of the show comes from the team's dedication to treating these fake monsters as real paranormal subjects and the often off-the-wall experiments they conduct in the pursuit of the truth. Despite the humor, the show is grounded in genuine paranormal investigative techniques and features interviews with experts who are often left scratching their heads. The result is a unique and entertaining look at the world of conspiracy theories and paranormal phenomena.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conspiracy Cases","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Paul Agosta","original_name":"Jeffrey Paul Agosta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6684beb110e78dc6d41f62d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dakota Frandsen","original_name":"Dakota Frandsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6684bec2979d80b8591a3920","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Stull","original_name":"Jared Stull","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"J-Train","credit_id":"6684becd946242d49875e7eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin Von Johnson","original_name":"Austin Von Johnson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Edward Page","credit_id":"6684bef8f009d81eb6d1b140","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Paul Agosta","original_name":"Jeffrey Paul Agosta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf0b63d0b5d7fa1a37e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luke Jones","original_name":"Luke Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf9eb7c2846cfcaed110","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luke Jones","original_name":"Luke Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf2c4edaa2272217bb6a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283529,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jake Kuwana","original_name":"Jake Kuwana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf3d097efaf0eb1a39de","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Paul Agosta","original_name":"Jeffrey Paul Agosta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf5ae865897168c68da2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4075844,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ryan Posey","original_name":"Ryan Posey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf4ee101049e951bb694","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283529,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jake Kuwana","original_name":"Jake Kuwana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6684bf7c7dab64c685817ace","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luke K.
