Viewing fire as an externalization of the passions and impulses deep within the human psyche represents a profound psychological projection of power, destruction, and transformation. In \"Fire,\" this symbolism is transformed into flowing ink paintings, where the changing flames not only display their physical beauty but also deeply depict human emotions and states of mind.
