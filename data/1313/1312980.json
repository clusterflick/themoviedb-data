Just before he disappeared, he delivers her a strange parcel : a magnificent fruit tray adorned with a ribbon inscribed with a date. What is this date? Why is an hourglass hidden between pomegranates and bunches of grapes ? Dreading a sign announcing her death, Mary wonders if she is not living her last week. We dive into her mind for these seven capital days, looking for inner peace and this mysterious deliverer of forbidden fruits.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/w73wKnwPmb8A6sKYaARwtLtJ0qB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memento Mori","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4811498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Prieur","original_name":"Clara Prieur","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bPIl91ldmyidIQZIJ6TpwlIX2yw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"66877524552d0be7e35e5376","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4811499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrice Girard","original_name":"Fabrice Girard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gabriel","credit_id":"66877512a7326fbfe3b9530a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2894137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cam Poirier","original_name":"Cam Poirier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/wll3S7JGhWt0Rs6HJGlvqgpRih7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Le tatoueur","credit_id":"6750ac53f858e9bb1659dd18","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4811498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Prieur","original_name":"Clara Prieur","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bPIl91ldmyidIQZIJ6TpwlIX2yw.jpg","credit_id":"668774c859f524f59bd4d8b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4811498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clara Prieur","original_name":"Clara Prieur","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bPIl91ldmyidIQZIJ6TpwlIX2yw.jpg","credit_id":"668774d5dbf866c30d080ccd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jTUHG4Vgmv5JZfK0vBfIcxCBXJh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w73wKnwPmb8A6sKYaARwtLtJ0qB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
