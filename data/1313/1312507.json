Observant Buddhist believers often converge here to perform a rite known as \"fangsheng\", or \"life release\", which refers to the practice of saving animals from captivity and releasing them into the water. The film tries to form a slice of the history of this eternal artificial architecture through ecology, geography and folklore. A Gopro camera was tied to a turtle that was released in the river to inspect the underwater space of the temple.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/unE3OHonJ5MErPygEf8FL9cs3m8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eternal Jinshan Temple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yihan Lin","original_name":"Yihan Lin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66860cfa5c62514df63b407d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23812844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1320,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/unE3OHonJ5MErPygEf8FL9cs3m8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":922}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Formosa Festival of International Filmmaker Awards","release_date":"2022-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
