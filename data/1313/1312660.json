This piece finds its inspiration in a close friend's dream, where she vividly reimagined personal memories and events from my life, casting them into surreal dreams. Using a unique blend of mixed mediums, including Super 8 film and digital recordings, the narrative captures the essence of a handmade marionette, echoing my likeness, contrasted with Super 8 visuals that mirror my friend, the muse behind this creation. A 'false awakening' describes the eerie sensation of waking while still ensnared in sleep, characterized by potent, lifelike images that stir feelings of anxiety and disorientation. Venturing through this film, many may experience nested dreams or successive false awakenings. The audience is prompted to contemplate: In the intricate dance between the conscious and the subconscious, where does reality end and the reverie begin?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FALSE AWAKENING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily O'Rourke","original_name":"Emily O'Rourke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"6686ae72f0953090c91a6d12","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4810584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","original_name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686ae166cb7656c3290ec3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4810584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","original_name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686ae49177754eeba33574e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4810584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","original_name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686ae31274ad23dab855462","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4810584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","original_name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686ae84487596cd10855364","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4810584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","original_name":"Cordelia Angel Clarke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686b02d9e518db05b1bdf3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
