She being of a jovial disposition, we see her rolling a hoop, skipping rope and romping until she is completely exhausted. Coming to a spring in the park, she stops and bathes her head in the cold water, and not being physically capable of withstanding the shock, she contracts a cold. By the time the maid gets her home she is extremely ill, and her mother puts her to bed and sends for a doctor, who, upon arriving, prescribes and pronounces her case as serious. The little sufferer is compelled to remain in bed for days, and when the time comes for her to go to her first communion she is unable to attend.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The happiest day of life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1786556","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1908-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
