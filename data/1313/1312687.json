Their son Raphael, a prodigy, is not accepted into a prestigious yeshiva. His mother, Ahuva, tries to handle the situation peacefully, but his father, Shmuel, a handyman with great faith, struggles to accept the situation. Shmuel fights to change this decree, leading to the family’s ostracization and their children’s expulsion from local institutions. A dramatic event shakes both the family and Haredi society, probing their shared faith. The film explores the struggles of Baalei Teshuva, their faith, their escape from the past, and the personal cost of their journey.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/wKT1X5taIPl4LM5IRDCrGM1nwnW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2024-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neither Day nor Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2152059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Menashe","original_name":"Eli Menashe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6686be945f515ecdf7259c0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Hatuka Peled","original_name":"Adam Hatuka Peled","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6686be9f6799976f72a542f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maayan Amrani","original_name":"Maayan Amrani","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6686beab0d841ede32335ad0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmuel Vilozni","original_name":"Shmuel Vilozni","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6686beb64edaa2272217f04d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorit Lev-Ari","original_name":"Dorit Lev-Ari","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/tiYhJVDNFf7qNdDFkds4HidBVmW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6686bed20d841ede32335ad5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4059832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phinehas Veuillet","original_name":"Phinehas Veuillet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686befbef5530b4b117f2cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4059832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phinehas Veuillet","original_name":"Phinehas Veuillet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686bf08cc35a29f175ec5ca","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ziv Berkovich","original_name":"Ziv Berkovich","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686bfb46799976f72a54309","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4810682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aharon Israel","original_name":"Aharon Israel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6686bf211a8d8c0741c1a979","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32858073","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wKT1X5taIPl4LM5IRDCrGM1nwnW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1463}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"MA 15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
