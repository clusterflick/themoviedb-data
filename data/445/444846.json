At nightfall, people seem to regain a vitality which explodes in the bars to the rhythm of the latest hits from the music charts. The first part tells the story of Petit-Jean, a young graduate, who is unemployed and roams the city in search of work. From humiliations to frustrations, the destiny of this young ordinary African changes dramatically. The second part follows a young girl who transforms herself into an angel of death in order to free herself from a traumatic past. The final section is of an encounter between a woman and a man who seem ordinary at first, but a past which the woman had thought had forever disappeared, resurfaces in this man.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"}],"release_date":"2000-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments of Life","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Bédiébé","original_name":"Jean Bédiébé","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/qIOZswVrhrnv3kWWLtKRm4OyKB6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"58b99edec3a368668600b36b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Beleck","original_name":"Hélène Beleck","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58b99efb925141606b00cb8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jérome Bolo","original_name":"Jérome Bolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58b99f06925141609b00bf40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deneuve Djobong","original_name":"Deneuve Djobong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"58b99f10925141606f00c63b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":87428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thilombo Lubambu","original_name":"Thilombo Lubambu","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"58b99f20925141607300c255","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Therese Ngo Ngambi","original_name":"Therese Ngo Ngambi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"58b99f2dc3a368663000b867","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325181,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"François Woukoache","original_name":"François Woukoache","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b99dcfc3a36866af00bc02","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769191,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sébastien Bucholz","original_name":"Sébastien Bucholz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b99eb6c3a368664d00c469","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721176,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Issa Traoré","original_name":"Issa Traoré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b99e5d925141606b00cb28","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325181,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"François Woukoache","original_name":"François Woukoache","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b99d28925141607b00c3e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769190,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bonaventure Takoukam","original_name":"Bonaventure Takoukam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b99dfe925141606f00c5a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0278452","wikidata_id":"Q51465400","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
