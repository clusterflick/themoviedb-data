But Landreau meets his match in the form of wandering do-gooder Jud Calvert (Charles Starrett).","popularity":0.3381,"poster_path":"/2ItuDDja2dxrJ2hMxYBRI9CInCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Smashing The West's Most Ruthless Cattle-Rustlin' Cut-Throats!","title":"The Pinto Kid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Starrett","original_name":"Charles Starrett","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/7DhidPyO8Z3regVeobzhRcbqlZT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jud Calvert","credit_id":"58b63345c3a3680678002dfa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Currie","original_name":"Louise Currie","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/fypixYxOgLhwd1E4V0xFH0WfDf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Betty Ainsley","credit_id":"58b633859251412661002f4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Nolan","original_name":"Bob Nolan","popularity":0.2354,"profile_path":"/rETHkemxurbKkChX8XaWbjxr950.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"58b6339592514121390030f3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sutton","original_name":"Paul Sutton","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":"/5mn88NY7h4IdaP2flsTjszHppNv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vic Landreau","credit_id":"58b63413c3a3680ee2002dbc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Bell","original_name":"Hank Bell","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/kJrAa6i3IK9I3AyNUOCRzuLh13P.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hank","credit_id":"58b634239251412ab1002c19","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Walker","original_name":"Francis Walker","popularity":0.1392,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Curt Harvey","credit_id":"58b63431c3a3680f41002b13","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Adams","original_name":"Ernie Adams","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/zpKSSdsuDVofN1GAAbKnkn2GjrL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ed Slade","credit_id":"58b634409251412139003147","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Rockwell","original_name":"Jack Rockwell","popularity":0.1902,"profile_path":"/dEcOceMFcKKxIp9khUJruuFmFiA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Marshal","credit_id":"58b63458c3a3686b50004087","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Gray","original_name":"Roger Gray","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dan Foster","credit_id":"58b6346a9251412f83002cbb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":981271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Botiller","original_name":"Dick Botiller","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/paRg7wpQSaixpA8egCQ6znmtC7r.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dan Foster","credit_id":"58b634799251411d140036ff","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lambert Hillyer","original_name":"Lambert Hillyer","popularity":0.3109,"profile_path":"/yR1IxGp1C8VXhnmYIDUcmZsDaly.jpg","credit_id":"58b633249251412661002f1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fred Myton","original_name":"Fred Myton","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b6332dc3a3687be60031c2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0034028","wikidata_id":"Q63934788","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQponyB0NkHiClaSrKfoakr242m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2660,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2ItuDDja2dxrJ2hMxYBRI9CInCG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1556,"name":"texas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1941-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
