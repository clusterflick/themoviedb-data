Out-of-work steelworker-turned- radical revolutionary Joe Starkhill and his band of comrades seize the Town Hall and take the Mayor, her driver, a security guard and a civil servant hostage - declaring the start of a socialist revolution in Britain. But when a faulty phone line prevents them from alerting the local newspaper and TV station, and the police write them off as a hoax, it is only when one of the hostages fails to return home for dinner, that the alarm is raised and Inspector John Machin is dispatched to the Town Hall to investigate - but it's not long before the building is surrounded by the press, police and public, turning Starkhill and the Revolutionaries into a media sensation.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glass & Glass Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"The Revolution Should Have Been Televised","title":"The Communists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Fox","original_name":"William Fox","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/m4MfpBOLTSDfpKzm31efqJgzXJR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Inspector John Machin","credit_id":"58b5dcf592514161a5001eb8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Galloway","original_name":"Richard Galloway","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Comrade Robbie Roy Galloway","credit_id":"58b5dd119251410dcc0004ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thanasis Manitarellis","original_name":"Thanasis Manitarellis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Comrade Dean Mavros","credit_id":"58b5dd2f9251410a90012503","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Moore","original_name":"Simon Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sergeant Simon Sergeant","credit_id":"58b5dd45c3a368563d0010ef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Osman","original_name":"James Osman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Comrade George Jimi Hamilton","credit_id":"58b5dd5ec3a3686c180004bb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Moore","original_name":"Simon Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sergeant Steve Sergeant","credit_id":"58b5dd6692514161a5001f31","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Underwood","original_name":"James Underwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Comrade Anthony Navarro","credit_id":"58b5dd7f9251410a9001255a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Kendra","original_name":"David Kendra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"News Presenter","credit_id":"58b5dd91c3a368563d001130","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre Gwilliam","original_name":"Andre Gwilliam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Civil Servant","credit_id":"58b5dda5c3a3686c180004fc","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Glass","original_name":"Simon Glass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b5dc919251416129001fe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168618,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Glass","original_name":"Simon Glass","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b5dc9e9251410dcc000497","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5684600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
