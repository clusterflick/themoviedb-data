Barry plays Jim Randall, a lawman assigned to investigate a series of gold shipment robberies. Arriving in the middle of a hold-up, Randall finds himself accused of killing the driver (Yakima Canutt). Wells Fargo agent Cal Chambers (Milton Kibbee) vouches for his innocence, however, claiming him to be a noted geologist. Along with several of the prospectors, Jim devises a plan to prove that Jud Parker (Harry Worth) is using his dummy mine as a cover for stealing ore.","popularity":0.9584,"poster_path":"/fRA04okAfLn9zZYoroMO2T3ZgYG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kansas Cyclone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don 'Red' Barry","original_name":"Don 'Red' Barry","popularity":0.8403,"profile_path":"/airyp28VpOMYnGyZ2RL706Uplmv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jim Randall","credit_id":"58b43726c3a3685220018c76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynn Merrick","original_name":"Lynn Merrick","popularity":0.2869,"profile_path":"/8iZAB44JupGmBOv5r1jNURqPDZ0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Martha King","credit_id":"58b4373492514177b40198fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Haade","original_name":"William Haade","popularity":0.1914,"profile_path":"/tKcWdfVukKLoNd9q4RqeVFUJ6yL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sheriff Ed King","credit_id":"58b4374192514177f6018ad1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Kibbee","original_name":"Milton Kibbee","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/hhWsIJNBO0ENVbfExPL6EqlZJUD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cal Chambers (as Milt Kibbee)","credit_id":"58b4374e92514177a401892f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Worth","original_name":"Harry Worth","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/uG5kZg2B2e3BkVBPap7yjFThYZ4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jud Parker","credit_id":"58b4375e92514177a401893b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Sebastian","original_name":"Dorothy Sebastian","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/3soMuXtGrf2v4haxG07xLNd94Wd.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Helen King","credit_id":"58b4376b92514177a4018949","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Kirk","original_name":"Jack Kirk","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/1wbf5Vtd8ks36a48vnGnodAOtNs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henchman Turner","credit_id":"58b43778c3a3685220018cae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Taylor","original_name":"Forrest Taylor","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/11tiZFYeWNfefJccEhNU4G3cYzp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ben Brown","credit_id":"58b4378492514177f6018b02","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1067843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles R.
