It is important to remember that the film does not represent what actually happened during the 1917 Revolution, but is rather an adaptation.","popularity":0.2018,"poster_path":"/xWkSEt2vONtFrmaw5DZ5vMkYIqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mezhrabpom-Rus","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1927-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moscow in October","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Moskva v oktyabre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Barnet","original_name":"Boris Barnet","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/226kdxiWvlKkDz8TkfG4C2fo4il.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58b6ffa392514146240001b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Bobrov","original_name":"Ivan Bobrov","popularity":0.1875,"profile_path":"/yCHbMMtSGOYzn5O7FfaTncYsSBw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58b6ffa9c3a36819d500018d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandr Gromov","original_name":"Александр Громов","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":"/nMtBHeZqJ0Vk3T8AgBXzTBImil6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58b6ffaf9251414646000177","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":10453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasili Nikandrov","original_name":"Vasili Nikandrov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lenin","credit_id":"58b6ffb7c3a36819d5000199","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768017,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alexander Rodchenko","original_name":"Alexander Rodchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/cWPQSGAuETXf6BvnOEZzWb1qc6t.jpg","credit_id":"58b6ffecc3a36819f2000170","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":625337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Lukashevich","original_name":"Tatyana Lukashevich","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/6Xey0sHz1JCaNThozl0HGvTsqv1.jpg","credit_id":"58b6fffcc3a3681a61000183","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189513,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oleg Leonidov","original_name":"Oleg Leonidov","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b6ff96925141463b0001b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Barnet","original_name":"Boris Barnet","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/226kdxiWvlKkDz8TkfG4C2fo4il.jpg","credit_id":"58b6ff89925141462c000193","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768015,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Boris Frantsisson","original_name":"Boris Frantsisson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e6c400abdbc06f95164e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396150,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Konstantin Kuznetsov","original_name":"Konstantin Kuznetsov","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e6c4aa1402e298e741879","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768016,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yakov Tolchan","original_name":"Yakov Tolchan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663e6c58267741ae49f2e1f7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0018173","wikidata_id":"Q30095031","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/xWkSEt2vONtFrmaw5DZ5vMkYIqG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1927-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
