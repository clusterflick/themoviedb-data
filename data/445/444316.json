But before he gets that far, there is a little matter of proving Kirby guilty of wrongdoing and to achieve that, Wild Bill earns the enmity of both the Wilsons.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/oBDJgD1gp0mEQTfmhFuZQ80FMhW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His newest thriller!","title":"North from the Lone Star","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Elliott","original_name":"Bill Elliott","popularity":0.2801,"profile_path":"/9Wafomp8j5p0CWnRXJWt6OlAg0m.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"'Wild' Bill Hickok","credit_id":"58b62a5dc3a3687be6002df3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Fiske","original_name":"Richard Fiske","popularity":0.1872,"profile_path":"/9HpRvRbP2tBF5hOmC5maqtCokLK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clint Wilson","credit_id":"58b62a6c9251412139002cd4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Fay","original_name":"Dorothy Fay","popularity":0.1816,"profile_path":"/bmGEgh9pbRD5QgW4JMb2zJXiTVy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Madge Wilson","credit_id":"58b62a799251412f8300278f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dub Taylor","original_name":"Dub Taylor","popularity":0.5884,"profile_path":"/a7eVCCqOeWPqJpBXoKse1vZj2sc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cannonball","credit_id":"58b62a869251412661002ade","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Loft","original_name":"Arthur Loft","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/b28n6iIl02r1KcPqbE5lERaoMZd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"'Flash' Kirby","credit_id":"58b62a959251416129005459","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":128643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Roper","original_name":"Jack Roper","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"'Rawhide' Fenton","credit_id":"58b62aa29251412ab10027ac","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Morrison","original_name":"Chuck Morrison","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Spike","credit_id":"58b62ab1c3a3686b50003bbb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1052820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Rochelle","original_name":"Claire Rochelle","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":"/6rMDQXhS2n0qPmFBeTF8vFmNwkc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Lucy Belle","credit_id":"58b62abdc3a3686b50003bc9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Rhein","original_name":"Al Rhein","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Slats","credit_id":"58b62acec3a3680678002a3c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Cobb","original_name":"Edmund Cobb","popularity":0.2406,"profile_path":"/icnYHc5GwjZzl9wF2nLP8rPvL8a.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dusty Daggett","credit_id":"58b62add9251411d14003221","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lambert Hillyer","original_name":"Lambert Hillyer","popularity":0.3109,"profile_path":"/yR1IxGp1C8VXhnmYIDUcmZsDaly.jpg","credit_id":"58b6291b925141612900539e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles F.
