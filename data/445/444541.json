The film shows the vital role community barbershops play as a forum for black men to discuss any topic, whether controversial or banal, sacred or profane, political or personal, in an environment of heated debate and/or male fellowship. Topics discussed in the film include HIV/AIDS, infidelity, gay marriage, greedy preachers, Bill Clinton, the world's sexiest actresses, and more. Though in some ways this is a quintessential black barbershop, where macho attitudes often prevail, women do play a role in the shop's conversations, and with the increasing gentrification of the area, a number of diverse clients (including a white gay man) occasionally enter the mix.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/4Cp73v3pRw7y0UwhEqhdlvw8Lf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cutting Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1827055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Mathias","original_name":"Camilla Mathias","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ouK5xaxajjhL8Nowb0InDgOlkfz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6466bb752bcf670172b03297","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768206,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bill McCullough","original_name":"Bill McCullough","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b781b692514161370028bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438033,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amani Martin","original_name":"Amani Martin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebdcca63d3557001ddc9d77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0834905","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r0yubgqwwPozBByYmHa3tg11QGH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Cp73v3pRw7y0UwhEqhdlvw8Lf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
