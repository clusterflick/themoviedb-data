Here, doctors and nurses work for free to serve people who would otherwise fall through the cracks. Clinica de Migrantes, a potent film by Maxim Pozdorovkin, follows the workers and patients of Puentes through months of routine care and growth. Along the way, the film puts a face to the millions of people who exist on the margins of society: people displaced from their homelands, separated from their families, unfamiliar with the customs, unable to obtain health insurance and terrified to come forward to seek medical help. Along with revealing these patient stories, Clinica is also a look at the heroic doctors and nurses who work pro bono to ensure these people receive care, offering a deeply moving look at the limitless potential of humanity.","popularity":0.4096,"poster_path":"/2cdFgPoMtkiYbo1pamrZwWYtXj2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third Party Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clínica de Migrantes: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxim Pozdorovkin","original_name":"Maxim Pozdorovkin","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/2ehjiSitpVWtrE8kHZZ9MidyxFM.jpg","credit_id":"58b784cec3a3685c35002a19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joe Bender","original_name":"Joe Bender","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc7005521c4ca00421fe875","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1562956,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeanne Applegate","original_name":"Jeanne Applegate","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc7009ca1074b0042ec2c4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5882,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacobo Lieberman","original_name":"Jacobo Lieberman","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/56bTHI6jaVlJHlp0PcIsqoedeIH.jpg","credit_id":"5fc700b913a388003d0530ff","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5881,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonardo Heiblum","original_name":"Leonardo Heiblum","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/wSwhrG7Zw8bnhjlKttvx08bcxzV.jpg","credit_id":"5fc700c13a340b003fe11f8d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxim Pozdorovkin","original_name":"Maxim Pozdorovkin","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/2ehjiSitpVWtrE8kHZZ9MidyxFM.jpg","credit_id":"5fc700c8a1074b0040ec56ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"5fc700d11b72940040921ed0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Bernstein","original_name":"Sara Bernstein","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/lHxgVjuHFdionBpk8BdQMf3Q95z.jpg","credit_id":"5fc700d9d132d6003f1e6c50","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5715756","wikidata_id":"Q26905813","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1687,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgMaQXdXyugzHHml0Q7TExauj7u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/yJGVXsMPsIyLwOfxxbhaoxaLBz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/2cdFgPoMtkiYbo1pamrZwWYtXj2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":889,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/fP6TVuNp3ZqgB786ZHeN2oD9jCU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":320591,"name":"immigrants"},{"id":337277,"name":"health-medical documentary"},{"id":337279,"name":"free medical care"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"HBO","release_date":"2016-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Clínica de Migrantes - Trailer (HBO Documentary Films)","key":"C7dW9c4nY1g","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-09-06T16:29:40.000Z","id":"5eddc1419c24fc002269e8c1"}]}}}
