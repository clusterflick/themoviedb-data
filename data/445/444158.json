The Empire of Tribe has authority over every other empire. King Bunzo chooses to sell his male subjects to slave traders who worked for the bloody tasty King of Northern Kingdom known as Emperor Tobitotaya. Emperor Tobitotaya is a dreadful Leader that wants Kings of other Nations to bow before him. Any King who refuses to do so, he would give a handshake of War. From greed, to betrayal, to bravery, to love, Tribe is a film that has a good dosage of such emotions in a manner that will have cinema lovers glued to their seats.","popularity":0.2762,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Igbosteve Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"2016-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tribe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Burno","original_name":"Peter Burno","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"King Bunzo","credit_id":"58b4a0ffc3a3685f0b0011c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Ebeye","original_name":"Amanda Ebeye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Princess Sankilari","credit_id":"58b4a1269251410ada00115f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1766743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekow Blankson","original_name":"Ekow Blankson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Wizard Otopo","credit_id":"58b4a145c3a3685f2c00114b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peachman Akputa","original_name":"Peachman Akputa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sonto Makatani","credit_id":"58b4a19a9251410a940011fc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766737,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Okonmah","original_name":"Steve Okonmah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b4a026c3a3685f1e001002","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":992879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ifeanyi Onyeabor","original_name":"Ifeanyi Onyeabor","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b49ec2c3a3685edf000f23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":179572,"name":"nigerian cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"TRIBE\"  Movie Trialer (rough-cut)","key":"j8hefKZY27g","published_at":"2011-07-01T22:44:59.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58b4a238c3a3685eb1001166"}]}}}
