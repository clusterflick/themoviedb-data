Shortly after 2:00 A.M., while most of the passengers slept, fire suddenly engulfed the luxury liner; within an hour, hundreds were dead or struggling desperately in the water. The fire's apparently inexplicable outbreak wasn't the only secret that night aboard the Morro Castle. Hours earlier, Captain Robert Wilmott had died in his cabin under suspicious circumstances. Had Wilmott been poisoned? Was the fire accidental, or intentionally set? This doc focuses on the incident and the speculation that the radio operator was the arson.","popularity":0.2612,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mystery of the Morro Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Goodman","original_name":"John Goodman","popularity":4.1878,"profile_path":"/yyYqoyKHO7hE1zpgEV2XlqYWcNV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Telegraph Operator","credit_id":"58b8d0bc925141606f00216a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Barzyk","original_name":"Fred Barzyk","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b8d0a7925141606b002254","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Barzyk","original_name":"Fred Barzyk","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b8d09d925141608400211b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2189997","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
