Cynthia Andrews is an aspiring actress who has been in a comfortable celibate relationship for three years with a faith oriented semi-pro kickboxer named Jay Durant. While Cynthia is pursing her dreams of acting, she is diagnosed with a life threatening disease and told she needs a kidney change or she was not going to survive. The process of finding a donor and managing her acting dreams and the thoughts of her not getting married and raising a family of her own become a burden. She begins feeling like all hope is lost, and her dream of becoming that actress and mother she always wanted to be was not happening as time was ticking. The film touches on the relevance of faith, hope and true love.","popularity":0.4736,"poster_path":"/49lG0U9RkQdojMnO98JhCUG3ue7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Digital
