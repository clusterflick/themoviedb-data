More importantly, Utterson is a Victorian Gentleman, who is guided by a chivalry-like code to remain loyal to his friends and maintain his status in society. It is loyalty that drives Utterson to play detective in an effort to protect Jekyll from the malicious and scheming Mr. Hyde. Eventually, Utterson finds himself introduced to a world that he is neither ready to enter nor accept. The story takes place in Victorian-era England, after the Industrial Revolution. Utterson, a lawyer, and true Victorian Gentleman, discovers that his long-time friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, has become involved with a mysterious and dangerous man named Edward Hyde. Jekyll is a tall, handsome man with a very high social status, which he is expected to maintain. Hyde is a complete opposite, short and vulgar, with an unidentifiable deformity.","popularity":1.1957,"poster_path":"/pK3Q6vSsoYsYLyHhSYnHo5rn8EN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The good and evil within humanity collide in a horrific confrontation in this faithful retelling of Stevenson's classic story.","title":"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Capaldi","original_name":"Gianni Capaldi","popularity":0.2501,"profile_path":"/u4aBjxRSBNbn8OV8Sg23GnkBJbb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Hyde","credit_id":"58b83ad3925141272a00a34b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Paul Piccinino","original_name":"Shaun Paul Piccinino","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Henry Jekyll","credit_id":"58b83adf925141272e00a5d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2244979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Beatty","original_name":"David Beatty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Gabriel John Utterson","credit_id":"5c6aadd192514129d5feb322","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William McNamara","original_name":"William McNamara","popularity":0.7906,"profile_path":"/hVOdM3UUmJqpREnBxzm0J4j0b5R.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bradshaw","credit_id":"58b83af8c3a3683560009a9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret O'Brien","original_name":"Margaret O'Brien","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/iLzh8P6N7qKWpVltgBOB7ItBfCu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ms. Stevenson","credit_id":"58b83b05c3a36835ad009a4a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Rooney","original_name":"Mickey Rooney","popularity":1.0004,"profile_path":"/eYuayEC3xhXQf3Z1Cy6AVMEcgZb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Louis","credit_id":"58b83b13c3a3683560009aad","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Wells","original_name":"Vernon Wells","popularity":0.6151,"profile_path":"/rpKjskAbftBMFi1HWZ0Jo6lZgod.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Enfield","credit_id":"58b83b20925141273600a9a5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elissa Dowling","original_name":"Elissa Dowling","popularity":0.223,"profile_path":"/1lv1Q9upYSm0tN1FvGrAq98zVMK.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Maude","credit_id":"58b83b2cc3a368359b00941b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randal Malone","original_name":"Randal Malone","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/oVJtShCZr2NNULcYZamzzd86Dlj.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mr. Poole","credit_id":"58b83b3ac3a368358d009417","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jed Rowen","original_name":"Jed Rowen","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/gQbls0bZuOqT9DskZhleqHlkx9s.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dr. Lanyon","credit_id":"58b83b4bc3a3683577009b1b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1970675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Pozo","original_name":"Joseph Pozo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Pub Patron","credit_id":"6434c8b2cca7de0103756f71","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486790,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"B.
