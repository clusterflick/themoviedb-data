The video combines documentary footage of New York City's rapidly disappearing network of payphones with audio of a covertly recorded telephone exchange between an actor and an unknowing bystander. In the surreptitiously captured conversation an attempted \"information leak\" is infused with an absurd story and a historical anecdote. The work's title refers to a Soviet spy who was apprehended in 1953 after mistakenly paying his newspaper delivery boy with a hollow coin that contained a microfilm of an encrypted message. Throughout the video a parallel sequence of events reveals that images from the video itself have been stored on an SD card concealed within a hollow coin and inserted into the payphone from which the call was made.","popularity":0.4998,"poster_path":"/fmlW5WSZ93WJIVgV87YdjYnsxMF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hollow Coin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Heath","original_name":"Frank Heath","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b3728692514177a400dce2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fmlW5WSZ93WJIVgV87YdjYnsxMF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":175514,"name":"prank telephone call"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Vimeo","release_date":"2016-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Screen Slate","release_date":"2020-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
