In The Blue Devils, Charlotte Bayer-Broc wanders through one of the ghost mining towns—a remote outpost in the Atacama Desert—interpreting Advis’s lament across eerily abandoned landscapes and industrial vistas. Bayer-Broc upends cinematic convention in a beguiling adaptation that is entirely her own; this medium-length musical is at once personal and political, reverent and burlesque.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/6tak5XO45z4o7hbLvNOF9IqZGnE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":"/gW6YiDdhkySff27C0m4JXu30879.png","name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los diablos azules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Blue Devils","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Bayer-Broc","original_name":"Charlotte Bayer-Broc","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60e5c3d68de0ae007e81e9f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3149193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gricel Jara","original_name":"Gricel Jara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60e5c3dd2811a10027acb3ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3149194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Jofré","original_name":"Sergio Jofré","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60e5c3e60e5aba0073e72eb4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3149196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Perez Reyes","original_name":"Valeria Perez Reyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60e5c3f56bdec30046125a03","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077838,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Victor Zébo","original_name":"Victor Zébo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e5c4090e5aba0073e72ed4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Bayer-Broc","original_name":"Charlotte Bayer-Broc","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9ee5c925141607300ebb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769482,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bertrand Scalabre","original_name":"Bertrand Scalabre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9efba925141607700f40f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769476,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rémi Carreau","original_name":"Rémi Carreau","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9ef7c925141607b00ee6d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769480,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Pablo Manríquez","original_name":"Juan Pablo Manríquez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9ef90925141607300ec52","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622522,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Romain Ozanne","original_name":"Romain Ozanne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9efa5c3a36866af00e79e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hélène Mourrier","original_name":"Hélène Mourrier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9ef52925141606b00f728","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13730222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1022,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6tak5XO45z4o7hbLvNOF9IqZGnE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
