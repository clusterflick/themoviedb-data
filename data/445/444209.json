The prosecution allows his motive was fear of being disinherited if he married his fianc√©, the fair Alicia Atherton, against his uncle's wishes, and the prosecution lays a mountain of evidence against Raymond, including his razor, dragged from an artificial lake on the estate, as the murder weapon; Raymond's bloody fingerprints and footprints found at the scene of bedroom crime, and his bloody shoes, found in his cupboard and bloody monogrammed-handkerchief found under his uncle's death bed. Raymond's only defense is that he could not have committed the crime as he goes into a paroxysm of dread at the mere sight of blood, a phobia he has had ever since childhood when his dog was run over by a lorry and the dog's blood was splattered into his face.","popularity":0.3557,"poster_path":"/2D4twnLPtKKwXfc24Duz1CQvrqN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28184,"logo_path":null,"name":"BIF","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1934-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Happened Then?","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bird","original_name":"Richard Bird","popularity":0.1322,"profile_path":"/iK8kbpLD3mgeWFkTVq9MLmIqYOC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peter Bromley","credit_id":"58b514e6c3a3685f1e005995","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorna Hubbard","original_name":"Lorna Hubbard","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alicia Altherton","credit_id":"58b514f99251410a84005ec8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Wardwell","original_name":"Geoffrey Wardwell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Raymond Rudford","credit_id":"58b51507c3a3685eb1005a64","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis L.
