An ex-miner, he was represented his community through the industrial action of the 1970s, the closure of the mines, and the slow drift to the ‘centre-ground’ within Labour politics. Famous for his sharp wit and unyielding style, Skinner has remained true to his roots, fighting for the disadvantaged and often getting himself into trouble in Parliament. The story of both a towering figure, and the fortunes of progressive politics in Britain over the last half-century.","popularity":0.1445,"poster_path":"/9BpfzARL0HuHW4hYAl3XkdGwUw8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87246,"logo_path":"/v0UNx9dDMWOwnREzsDEGggzmW3a.png","name":"Shut Out The Light","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Man is a political animal","title":"Nature of the Beast","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Skinner","original_name":"Dennis Skinner","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/dOgGQofaSrfueEJGUwiND0GIptz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58b81b3d925141273a0092ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christie Allanson","original_name":"Christie Allanson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b81c0bc3a36835770086d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Draper","original_name":"Daniel Draper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b81befc3a368352e008b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Draper","original_name":"Daniel Draper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b81c1ac3a36835770086de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405796,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Auguste","original_name":"Sam Auguste","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b89f479251415fb4002fbe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768700,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allan Melia","original_name":"Allan Melia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b89eb3c3a36841ed003022","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768703,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Dineen","original_name":"Patrick Dineen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b89fbf9251415f9500303e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susanne Levin","original_name":"Susanne Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d13612bc3a36811ee22c75d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319007,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Bell","original_name":"Matthew Bell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d13611d0e0a267dcecb5258","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Higgs","original_name":"Simon Higgs","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d13613c0e0a267dcecb5278","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Draper","original_name":"Daniel Draper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d136154925141580cb9050e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christie Allanson","original_name":"Christie Allanson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1361729251416ecbb90f99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6171452","wikidata_id":"Q38463414","facebook_id":"@DennisSkinnerFilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"@DSkinnerFilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":958,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9BpfzARL0HuHW4hYAl3XkdGwUw8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.729,"height":2357,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fIgWzz1janalgnVn8VQXJPCpHlZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1719},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ypVe7dTHTzxQw17CwRsmr5WWKEy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233295,"name":"dennis skinner"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dennis Skinner: Nature of the Beast - Teaser Trailer #2","key":"dwt_yp1cmNk","published_at":"2016-10-02T09:29:40.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58b81b0f9251412781009055"}]}}}
