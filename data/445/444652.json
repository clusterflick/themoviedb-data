The film is inspired by three distinct periods of Simmons’s photographic work: vintage hand puppets, ventriloquist dummies and walking objects enact tales of ambition, disappointment, love, loss, and regret. Working with composer Michael Rohaytn (\"Personal Velocity\") and cameraman Ed Lachman (\"The Virgin Suicides\" and \"Far From Heaven\"), Simmons’s puppets come to life in miniature domestic scenes that echo real life.","popularity":0.5354,"poster_path":"/krXrHFghlSyO06j7McLVh8Scdk6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Wide Media","origin_country":""},{"id":134555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Performa","origin_country":""},{"id":134556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salon 94","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Music of Regret","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meryl Streep","original_name":"Meryl Streep","popularity":2.6996,"profile_path":"/g5cVxQBAQ3AXt3LhdBXtbbN47Uc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"58b871249251415fba00133e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2521059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Guettel","original_name":"Adam Guettel","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Man (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd4060e2bca800208b8dc5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Nation","original_name":"Tony Nation","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/x8YlzfHPDt07mjOYr35uKCXa9Rx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ted (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd4067a3b5e60020599809","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Tully","original_name":"John Tully","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tod (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd4089021cee00228ac64a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2654901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Adams","original_name":"Lisa Adams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/l1BOB2lroQx3iTOE0MiL5r1j0hj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"May (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd4094a3b5e6002059985a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":139154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garland Hunter","original_name":"Garland Hunter","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"June (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd40a619690c001d71a0a9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sasse","original_name":"David Sasse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Danny (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd40b335818f0020c1df24","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Morgan","original_name":"Nathan Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Donny (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd40bd1da7a6001ccfd0af","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2654904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Inneo","original_name":"Anthony Inneo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jerry (voice)","credit_id":"5ecd40c335818f0020c1df45","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Fiorenza","original_name":"Julie Fiorenza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gun","credit_id":"5ecd40cb19690c001d71a0df","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Sinacori","original_name":"Greg Sinacori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"House / Camera","credit_id":"5ecd40d5e2bca8001e8aaa93","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Willis","original_name":"Marcus Willis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Cupcake","credit_id":"5ecd40e28efe73001d15acdd","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James A.
