As President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's motorcade creeps through the teeming streets of Qom Shrine, thousands of people jam hand-written letters into the hands of his handlers. Hearing their President deliver a speech is a thrill, but more promising to these men and women is the hope that their letters - expressing pleas for loans, medical attention, housing and jobs - will be answered. Since his 2005 election on a populist, \"man of the people\" platform, Ahmadinejad has encouraged Iranians to send him such letters; according to a staff member, he has received about 10 million of them, and has been able to respond to nearly 76 percent.

As other letters are read, the worker says that \"In Islam, charity is a necessity.\"","popularity":0.1255,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters To The President","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1625013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad","original_name":"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58b9d965c3a368663000d72d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Lom","original_name":"Petr Lom","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b9d988925141606f00e574","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1382278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18009,"name":"iran"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
