Grab moments of reality, following your desires, without first judging the coherence of the whole. Wander. Trust the pictures - and the sounds. Slowly, confront the first pieces and discover what your desires meant. Put aside certain shots that don't fit. Shoot more; complete the composition, trying not to reduce it to a story.

Each of us is a social body.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opera mundi ou le temps des survêtements","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Rey","original_name":"Nicolas Rey","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b74478c3a3681e46000534","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
