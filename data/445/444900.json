Gespräche mit meiner Freundin","overview":"Constantly on the look out for a bit of sex and fun, my girlfriend Annette makes regular forays into the club world on American army bases in Frank- furt and the surrounding area. Annette’s candour, the provocative way this German academic discusses her sexual desires, as well as her penchant for on-camera exhibitionism whenever she happens to find herself beside a black GI, illuminates a side of female sensuality that is rarely portrayed. Annette’s alert and inquisitive erotic behaviour and her own ‘outrageous’ take on life doesn’t merely change our view of the male world at the bar- racks – it turns it upside down completely.
