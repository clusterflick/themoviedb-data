Some thirty inhabitants occupy this alternative lodging space, their salvation after the wave of deinstitutionalization that one day threw them into the streets with no resources. Profit rules, and so this motel at the world's end will be destroyed to fill the pockets of promoters. The film captures this turning of the page, where each lost character reshuffles their daily life in moving on to the next chapter. Lending an ear to these forgotten outcasts, Manor is careful in framing these shadowy figures, bringing them to life in the light of our attention.","popularity":0.0817,"poster_path":"/6JSnNwfvszTNEhE3HtjLZeEvKot.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier-Luc Latulippe","original_name":"Pier-Luc Latulippe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b43d0992514177ac0190b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Fournier","original_name":"Martin Fournier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b43cde92514177d1019df7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5127360","wikidata_id":"Q56479572","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6JSnNwfvszTNEhE3HtjLZeEvKot.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
