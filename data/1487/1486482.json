In order to investigate the fate of these people, a National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) was formed on December 15, 1983, and concluded its work on September 20, 1984, with the preparation of a report entitled \"Nunca Más\" (Never Again). In Mendoza, more than 100 statements were received, but it was the testimony of a former officer of the Federal Police, Mendoza Delegation, that opened File No. 7746. This statement states that the Federal Police of our province carried out numerous operations, attacks, kidnappings, torture, murders, and robberies. File 7746, CONADEP, constitutes a new element for the Federal Court of Mendoza to judge those responsible for the largest genocide in the province.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7c9XeFaDtGLh8Ql0YSa1vLElP7X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263226,"logo_path":null,"name":"UNCuyo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2004-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7746 Legajo CONADEP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5458417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Sepúlveda","original_name":"Rodrigo Sepúlveda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683121205f647053e70546ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5458417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Sepúlveda","original_name":"Rodrigo Sepúlveda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68312130a2ae0df7eb0367c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3842219,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gisela Levin","original_name":"Gisela Levin","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68312145184eb7fe46a862aa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3842214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cecilia Agüero","original_name":"Cecilia Agüero","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68312183d9feb8d29ca861ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5458422,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anahí Barrera","original_name":"Anahí Barrera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683121c48f47ed8371b6ab7a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0983993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dSpVZyEmkCJBXZjOzZcaCcsL0ap.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7c9XeFaDtGLh8Ql0YSa1vLElP7X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"7746 Legajo Conadep.
