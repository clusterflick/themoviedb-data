Eva is one of the strongest activists in the H.I.J.O.S. organization, and through her and her sister's and mother's stories, the film addresses human rights, clandestinity, uprooting, and exile. The film recovers the dreams of a generation, which resurface in the activism of their sons and daughters, central participants in the demands for memory, truth, and justice—demands that articulate with new social struggles.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dwsRCORDFn46gGo3DqWeF5HmZow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263172,"logo_path":null,"name":"GA.TA progetti audiovisivi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Semillas de utopía","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1078223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estela de Carlotto","original_name":"Estela de Carlotto","popularity":0.3409,"profile_path":"/2ERzH5Vnc03sr43CduDGKiNcBhe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6830749cfca5da67032b6572","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hebe Pastor de Bonafini","original_name":"Hebe Pastor de Bonafini","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"683074a5881cc2c11e72ef45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Ferrante","original_name":"Nadia Ferrante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"683074c15ab3679e36b6a855","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Muglia","original_name":"Andrea Muglia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"683074d0155bf9d935836f6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Eva Arroyo","original_name":"María Eva Arroyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"683074de68a13bc035837101","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia D'Andrea","original_name":"Sofia D'Andrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"683074efa32c69e61c05449e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo Colombara","original_name":"Rodolfo Colombara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6830752780f9c90c3d03653f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuela Peyretti","original_name":"Emanuela Peyretti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6830753a4cf65dea80836ff0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo Colombara","original_name":"Rodolfo Colombara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6830756da32c69e61c0544a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuela Peyretti","original_name":"Emanuela Peyretti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6830757d380ebee35a72efcc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo Colombara","original_name":"Rodolfo Colombara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6830759bc7ff56358beb24ad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo Colombara","original_name":"Rodolfo Colombara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683075a4249fc96d9572efc2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuela Peyretti","original_name":"Emanuela Peyretti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683075c22d616b90cab6a8e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dHaZatyJxVOlPmfyTeTPwtCJZbL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwsRCORDFn46gGo3DqWeF5HmZow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Semillas de utopia -
