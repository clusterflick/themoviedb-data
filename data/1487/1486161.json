He decides to go on an outing with them, incurring the anger of his dad, who at first sends his servant, Dhamu, to bring him back. When Dhamu fails, he sends Mirza Usman, and when Mirza too fails to bring Rajendra home, Kailashnath himself sets out himself, but when he reaches them, he finds that the children have already left for home. Angered at his son for mixing with poor students, he decides to remove him from the school and have him taught at home - and the person he has recruited is none other than Shaktimaan Singh - a Circus Ringmaster. The question remains will Shaktimaan be able to appropriately discipline Rajendra?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vl8wgEskWHDfioStCY9SpVpy3jX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hum Panchhi Ek Dal Ke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":927614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Master Romi","original_name":"Master Romi","popularity":0.3379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rajendra Nath Mehra","credit_id":"6830802570315f34812b6398","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satish Vyas","original_name":"Satish Vyas","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nandu","credit_id":"6830804a226d8b2e862b6413","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":944609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Irani","original_name":"Daisy Irani","popularity":0.5186,"profile_path":"/vX1n4fhfU19GooP6PhpnUyT71SL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Chatpat","credit_id":"68308060977e78e7aaa8604a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Achala Sachdev","original_name":"Achala Sachdev","popularity":0.4536,"profile_path":"/6kgq6Mnmd01HZzvbsEDQAFBurog.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Prema Mehra","credit_id":"6830808c59374be94e0364f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murad","original_name":"Murad","popularity":0.6645,"profile_path":"/3pEKkELCA58BmbHCX6GVhllunnE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rai Bahadur Kailash Nath Mehra","credit_id":"683080a8dc74bba1a6036599","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":618699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jagdeep","original_name":"Jagdeep","popularity":1.0822,"profile_path":"/fDhNk4zi18lp3s69Q1Hu7n6X7wr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mehmood","credit_id":"6830814f4e03b5b9534134ab","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1678042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"P.L.
