The two films are projected side by side and slightly out of sync, creating a type of 'visual stereo' as they make random juxtapositions. The soundtrack being slightly out of sync creates an echo, so as the audience moves around the installation the sound changes, creating an aural sense of the space.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"I am a Microscope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Nussbaum","original_name":"Karl Nussbaum","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683082556bb72f986405452a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
