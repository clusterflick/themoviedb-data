The film focuses on one theatre, Usha Talkies (in Ahmedabad), whose spirited employees and raucous, seat-breaking public make it one of a kind. This cinema is meant for the masses. The question raised is, are the masses to be deprived of the incomparable experience of the big screen? Through a series of evocative arguments put forth by the employees of Usha Talkies, a vivid portrait is painted of a unique way of life, which may soon become extinct.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Show Less","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5459491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nayantara Kotian","original_name":"Nayantara Kotian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6831bfba8121cf5b6f72f5f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruchi Pugalia","original_name":"Ruchi Pugalia","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6831c9becd1c8829aa72f52d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3508665,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Akhila Krishnan","original_name":"Akhila Krishnan","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6831c9d80e7cbb0327036b08","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5459491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nayantara Kotian","original_name":"Nayantara Kotian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6831c9eadc74bba1a6036b03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
