As is often the case in Henri Agresti's films, there is an encounter with other peoples, other cultures, documented at length in the introduction. Then, after the interminable approach, the ascent begins: distribution of camps, successive assaults on the mountain, walking on steep scree and snowy slopes, climbing on icy walls... The arrival at the summit, without the aid of oxygen devices, seems to take place in slow motion: exhaustion mixes with the joy of the victorious mountaineers who will celebrate their success on their return to base camp on August 24, 1969.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/uBzPW1iQwJlDEIQiq3CreQhRWJ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196912,"logo_path":"/nRtogyDc0ZaW7SHNxlXe0ZJO92l.png","name":"Club Alpin Français
