The boat is caught in willows, however, and Brian meets Judy, a little maidservant who introduces him to her mistress, Auntie Sue, a schoolteacher. Under Auntie Sue's benign influence, Brian reforms and writes a book. Falling in love with Betty Jo, Brian incurs the enmity of Judy, who tells her father of Brian's unsavory past. Judy's father starts out for the bank, but Auntie Sue gets there first and persuades the bank president (a former pupil of hers) not to prosecute Brian. Brian's wife attempts to visit him and is drowned. Brian finds happiness with Betty Jo.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sol Lesser Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Re-Creation of Brian Kent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Shadow of His Sin","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"甦りの日","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Por su honra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Harlan","original_name":"Kenneth Harlan","popularity":1.5886,"profile_path":"/nIiGHwnOGFrZW2pui9rUKRFPs5p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brian Kent","credit_id":"6830bc0a94584af5ae05451d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Chadwick","original_name":"Helene Chadwick","popularity":0.8926,"profile_path":"/hQ6wcUWMxCRed2DLRTpfutPtnuD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Betty Joe","credit_id":"6830bc15cd1c8829aa72f10f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Carr","original_name":"Mary Carr","popularity":1.9029,"profile_path":"/vV3wvbwq2H0X9PjFMU1q9jXnN0Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Auntie Sue","credit_id":"6830bc27977e78e7aaa8616f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zasu Pitts","original_name":"Zasu Pitts","popularity":2.4298,"profile_path":"/yzz6JRsLsmciHcsv7lEigYy2cEy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"6830bc3992473c9ae54137bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":1.1098,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Kent","credit_id":"6830bc43a4f5e75043b6a9ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
