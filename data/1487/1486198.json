Using his innovative device, the praxinoscope, Reynaud presented an animation that showed his little ones throwing a cat with a blanket, capturing the movement of the animal in the air. This is part of the third series of animations that Reynaud created for his praxinoscope and was exhibited at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1878.  The praxinoscope, patented by Reynaud in 1877, improved on the zoetrope to incorporate a series of images that reflect the images, providing a clearer and more brilliant visualization. \"The Two Mischievous Ones\" is one of the first animations created with this method and destroyed by its contribution to the early start of the animation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Deux Espiègles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Émile Reynaud","original_name":"Émile Reynaud","popularity":0.3983,"profile_path":"/v1QpXCDrSvW1qbLU7saTPxvaa4y.jpg","credit_id":"68308838f8293a2498a85f67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32172972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les Deux Espiègles (1878) - Émile Reynaud - Public Domain Film","key":"wo0hzNqGsVc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-10T09:19:18.000Z","id":"68308878a2ae0df7eb03651a"}]}}}
