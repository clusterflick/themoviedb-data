At home, her mother urges her to present a version of herself that will be accepted— safe. But when Olivia forms a friendship with a bold, free-spirited girl from her neighborhood, she begins to glimpse another way of being, questioning the image she's been taught to uphold. Torn between who she is and who she’s expected to become, Olivia takes a quiet, courageous step toward self-acceptance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/msFZ9XT30GyHvHerAv5f3tPdnZ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Best Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Los Mejores Ojos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sage Wynters","original_name":"Sage Wynters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"6832488c184eb7fe46a8675a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Cruz","original_name":"Jackie Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"683248ab881cc2c11e72f5f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2482704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyrie McAlpin","original_name":"Kyrie McAlpin","popularity":0.8696,"profile_path":"/3VEVs33Ko368N6l6MrgiprVWQVr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Shay","credit_id":"683248b4dc74bba1a6036d31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2426019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Foster Ballard","original_name":"Adam Foster Ballard","popularity":0.3473,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jerome","credit_id":"683248c21ce59bcc97b6af62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Wood","original_name":"Juan Wood","popularity":0.2175,"profile_path":"/cxg6wVQE3kVSzzZv8c4GllUUyqI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lee","credit_id":"683249120e7cbb0327036d1e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3625491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loren Fenton","original_name":"Loren Fenton","popularity":0.9099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Janice","credit_id":"68324925440c078c6bb6af6e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1870681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kira Powell","original_name":"Kira Powell","popularity":0.8976,"profile_path":"/A1uv58BBjN8Snwbza134S8GyxOC.jpg","credit_id":"68324864881cc2c11e72f5ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5460501,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Udit Nijhawan","original_name":"Udit Nijhawan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683248e968a13bc035837855","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3673186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tara Austin","original_name":"Tara Austin","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683248f513b91a37ca2b6ec9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33270239","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1552,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/msFZ9XT30GyHvHerAv5f3tPdnZ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1035}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
