After decades of breaking barriers in a sport known for its lack of diversity, Robb builds his own team—Rotek Racing—bringing together a dynamic, multicultural crew that reflects the change he wants to see in motorsports. This high-octane documentary takes you beyond the track and into the heart of a season-long battle, offering unprecedented access to one of the most diverse teams in the paddock. Race/America is a story of speed, grit, and the drive to make history.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/nrFGrrK4AflPpqOQv8j1DdYZH6n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mile High Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Behind the wheel.
