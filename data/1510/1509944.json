A drama comedy with a twist, set in the wild West of Ireland. When Colm, the head of the family, dies, there are few who mourn his passing, not even his four estranged adult children. But, the legalities of his will must be observed, and more than one Canavan sibling is harbouring secrets. As the Canavans return to the family home, the fate of the family unit, their sanity, and the Canavan estate all hang in the balance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":267307,"logo_path":null,"name":"WaveWalker
