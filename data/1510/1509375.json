She wakes to find herself in a laboratory and is greeted by a doctor. She demands an explanation and the doctor explains she is to be used as a subject in a trial to test his newly developed pheromone. The chemical compound of his synthetic pheromone is unique and powerful enough that only someone with Superior Girl's strength and resistance could be a suitable test subject. In order to test the compound, the doctor releases a genetically modified humanoid into the room. This monstrosity has a taste for blood, but the real test is if the pheromone Superior Girl has been dosed with, is enough to distract the monster's violent tendencies. If it is, the monster should turn into a sexual predator.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bsjjOC8IU0dcj9rt4i2gFTaHVE4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Test Subject","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2304249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Rolland","original_name":"Bella Rolland","popularity":32.027,"profile_path":"/x3UjyPI05EZhNFCcMNcg5YK3ceX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Superior Girl","credit_id":"686ad21a6ce9d985b0ed575e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ad22969fa3110009a3dcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jDSFyl1MvK4up9zskR7NSiYoqZD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bsjjOC8IU0dcj9rt4i2gFTaHVE4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
