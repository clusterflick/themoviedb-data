Suddenly, a young person dressed in  orange (symbolic of curiosity) enters the frame, with a  question mark visible on the back of their clothes. After  surveying the crowds, the orange figure decides to follow  their path briefly, before turning away â€“ revealing a  lightbulb on the front of their clothes. Proceeding forward,  the orange figure notices a space full of white blocks. They  initially inspect them, before starting to build a small wall.","popularity":0.1071,"poster_path":"/iMBzgzOwDFeqO13m7Zx6TWN4uJC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262893,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snoitcudorp Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-07-03","revenue":128,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on the lectures of Bertrand Russell","title":"The Analysis of Mind","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"The questioning of sanity","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Hutt","original_name":"Isabelle Hutt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Questioner","credit_id":"686a62c089dc8fa30e51dabe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Sands","original_name":"Bradley Sands","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Unknown I","credit_id":"686a62dddf11df65fa53fd4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5454420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry Butcher","original_name":"Harry Butcher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Unknown II","credit_id":"686a62ea1e2d400fe0702813","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4812733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Foord","original_name":"Xavier Foord","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Unknown III","credit_id":"686a64f68e0f9512dc70288b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Austin","original_name":"James Austin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686a6304851c55761953fcfe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547304,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Austin","original_name":"James Austin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686a63218af615c04d9a3f4c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4812733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Foord","original_name":"Xavier Foord","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686a6332e467830aac10349a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547306,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Michael Chan","original_name":"Michael Chan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686a63532fd123268270291b","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547314,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Austin","original_name":"James Austin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686a651c3443346997a9533e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mCeEpEjMl9RqRsk2InsxlwkSPjo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iMBzgzOwDFeqO13m7Zx6TWN4uJC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y7iH9LiD3htQ0GixW3eGSLt24Ma.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Lift-Off First-Time Filmmakers Volume 6","release_date":"2025-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Analysis of Mind","key":"cEycAVN-X0E","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-23T19:19:04.000Z","id":"686a6cb26d007f066d10348e"}]}}}
