Centred on Irish architect Shane de Blacam, it begins in his Dublin study, where Palladio’s plates frame Louis Kahn’s sketches. From Inishmaan to Rome, from Veneto to New Haven, the film follows a path of conversations, buildings and landscapes – tracing the uncertain mechanics of architectural inheritance. Contributors include Kenneth Frampton, Níall McLaughlin, Sheila O’Donnell and others.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temptation of Influence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane de Blacam","original_name":"Shane de Blacam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686beff63443346997a95a25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2444760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Frampton","original_name":"Kenneth Frampton","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686bf0109b2ba2c5c19a4230","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Níall McLaughlin","original_name":"Níall McLaughlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686bf02e445f5aad1c702f9a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheila O'Donnell","original_name":"Sheila O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686bf045a5a9370ce3103abc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815979,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marko Milovanović","original_name":"Marko Milovanović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686befb6c2c18530d1cee666","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815979,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marko Milovanović","original_name":"Marko Milovanović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686befbb851c557619540411","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549866,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paolo Barkett","original_name":"Paolo Barkett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686befc5e9091b29da9a41f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSGrO4TuHRuxqTq9ZTzHNvkgEuC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Galway Film Fleadh","release_date":"2025-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
