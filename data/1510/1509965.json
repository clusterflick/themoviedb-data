Neri is a writer. Hanan, a musician, has been writing and singing since the age of 13. Through their creative work, they break down the walls of silence and concealment that separate the outside world from the storm within their home. Art allows them to engage in dialogue and create meaning and beauty within the chaos the entire family endures. Neri’s prose and Hanan’s music guide the film, giving voice to the pain of a family’s long struggle with mental illness.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":267313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galil Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":24477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabinovich Film Fund Cinema Project","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2025-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550138,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Neri Aluma","original_name":"Neri Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"686c130bdf11df65fa5404d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550136,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanan Aluma","original_name":"Hanan Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"686c131381b466753653fffd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Shelach","original_name":"Chen Shelach","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c1259eb6de7aeae9a43e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Shelach","original_name":"Chen Shelach","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c1264f75eacd43f103db1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chen Shelach","original_name":"Chen Shelach","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c126d2e4f1002429a435f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550134,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Inbal Sprinzak Goelman","original_name":"Inbal Sprinzak Goelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12a7511d589e4e7033c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550136,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanan Aluma","original_name":"Hanan Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12b2e56c47a84c6e85b9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3024207,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Micha Livne","original_name":"Micha Livne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12c069fa3110009a4277","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550138,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Neri Aluma","original_name":"Neri Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12cd0fe24ad4afa95baa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550136,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanan Aluma","original_name":"Hanan Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12d42c4efacbc153ff62","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550139,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Uri Aluma","original_name":"Uri Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12df5abbb69e3d9a43af","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550141,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shani Aluma","original_name":"Shani Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12e9851c5576195404d3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550144,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adam Aluma","original_name":"Adam Aluma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12f46801694f41103a2d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550145,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Liri An","original_name":"Liri An","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c12ff851c5576195404e0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNJLpkhkNJ0pe1ZpHSorQH9dd85.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
