On February 24, 2022, Russian tanks entered Kherson, leading to brutal occupation marked by violence. Despite being outnumbered, local defense forces resisted, and citizens protested under the slogan \"Kherson is Ukraine!\" An underground resistance formed, led by brave individuals like journalist Valentyna and others who risked arrest and torture to support the cause. After nine months, Ukrainian forces liberated Kherson, but Russian destruction left the city in chaos. Shelling and drone attacks became relentless, and in June 2023, a dam explosion flooded the city, causing further devastation. Despite these challenges, Kherson's spirit remained unbroken, with citizens embracing arts and resilience. By August 2024, drone attacks specifically targeted civilians, yet the city resisted, determined to rebuild and reclaim its identity, refusing to succumb to ruin.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/8SSG7Tz1niTs7IPgUd2p418JByG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zarina Zabrisky","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Imagine drones circling your neighborhood - hunting you.","title":"Kherson: Human Safari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5548211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zarina Zabrisky","original_name":"Zarina Zabrisky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dm6UtYXo1oc1kAEpBtonOsCxFjE.jpg","credit_id":"686ae19c851c55761953ffa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5548211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zarina Zabrisky","original_name":"Zarina Zabrisky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dm6UtYXo1oc1kAEpBtonOsCxFjE.jpg","credit_id":"686ae1c3ab576745cdcee48d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5548216,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yegor Irodov","original_name":"Yegor Irodov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ae1e9f2cd5874466e8191","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5548217,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oleksandr Andriushchenko","original_name":"Oleksandr Andriushchenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ae21c7aab150fb9702bcb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5548219,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Artem Tsynskyi","original_name":"Artem Tsynskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ae252064c4eae466e8204","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5548220,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason N.
