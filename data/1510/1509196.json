The director’s deeply personal and referential work preserves Kafka’s absurdism and pays homage to Weimar cinema of the 1920s, but elevates the text to an existential meditation on authority, purpose and human helplessness. Put simply, it is a cinematic magnum opus that triumphs on all fronts.","popularity":0.3643,"poster_path":"/nwEXAyVJVSxDO1Bc7MVjJdxKM0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
