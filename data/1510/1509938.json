More than half were of Yemeni origin. Over the years, following public outcry, three commissions of inquiry were established, yet the fate of most of the children, including Yadida Jovany, remains unknown.

The opening of the archives in 2016 and the release of over 200,000 documents offered a first opportunity for intimate acquaintance with her past.
