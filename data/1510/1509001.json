This documentary thoughtfully explores the diversity of trans experiences, the importance of community, and the power of being patient with yourself in a society that often rejects your identity. With care and honesty, Johnson-Vosberg presents Unlabelled as a moving portrait of extraordinary individuals who too often go unnoticed in everyday life. The film invites us to reflect on the role of identity and poses a bold question: what if we imagined a future without labels?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unlabelled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4688113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy Belgum","original_name":"Lucy Belgum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6869d29448e76658149a3ab9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5546476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emery Payne","original_name":"Emery Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6869d29f919517ace9a95a94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucah Rosenberg-Lee","original_name":"Lucah Rosenberg-Lee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6869d2ab8a675c21b27026d9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3112620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colette Johnson-Vosberg","original_name":"Colette Johnson-Vosberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6869d25e172af16ba29a3aee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36935756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lKsNP2QdYjr4I3foz7XxbJSUUa0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
