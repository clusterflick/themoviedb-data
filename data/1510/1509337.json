In both countries there are citizens' groups actively engaged in protesting, lobbying and educating the public. This Island is Ours follows a Korean kindergarten caretaker with a background in student activism and a recently widowed Japanese housewife as they campaign tirelessly for the sovereignty of the tiny islets that are currently controlled by Korea, but also claimed by Japan. This film creates a rare insight into the lives of the two activists on both sides by presenting their parallel experiences from a neutral point of view.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4epv0aPh9eLTqEXzY7cy7RBduCE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Island is Ours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Clauss","original_name":"Nils Clauss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686abfd69772f95ef7a95a00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5547985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Bukh","original_name":"Alexander Bukh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686abfe2ba81d2d162ed55e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5959886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4epv0aPh9eLTqEXzY7cy7RBduCE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
