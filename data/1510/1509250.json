The concert was filmed in a visually stunning setting, with the band performing amidst historical masterpieces within the prestigious art school. The performance included tracks from both their debut album, \"An Awesome Wave,\" and their then-latest release, \"This Is All Yours,\" showcasing their unique blend of electronic alt-rock.  The concert was lauded for its unique atmosphere and the band's ability to connect with the audience despite the lack of extensive banter. The show was described as a \"smorgasbord of delights for the ears and eyes,\" highlighting the visual spectacle of the venue and the band's contrasting future-pop sounds.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bPndGdUNnaTVV7Udjfyn8mNfHJn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alt-J - Live at Chapelle des Beaux-Arts","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3748586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Newman","original_name":"Joe Newman","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/ulhx7wWnTj05BUUzodxlOWi9e3O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"686a955471b75ad374a95740","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3748583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Unger-Hamilton","original_name":"Gus Unger-Hamilton","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/b0mwb1O5aROtzYmtSmc695JlwXE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"686a95632a644c69099a3bc2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Sonny Green","original_name":"Thom Sonny Green","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"686a956a5cfab44819ed554c","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/itdZsQQzXk8e2omlptFGi0RYbxq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bPndGdUNnaTVV7Udjfyn8mNfHJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
