With each heavy step across the gray, lifeless field, he carries not only his own weight, but the burdens of an entire generation.  He does not speak. He does not turn back. We do not know his name. But we know where he’s going.  The River awaits.  A meditation on isolation, purpose, and the absurdity of existence, \"Идущий к реке\" captures the Slavic soul in a single low-res frame. What started as a simple clip from a local Russian TV segment became a viral icon of stoicism, despair, and meme-worthy introspection.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/r932M2U6fedRyC6Nuxgmcbln7Dd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The journey means more than the destination.","title":"The Man Walking to the River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","original_name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Man in Black Jacket","credit_id":"686baed6172af16ba29a4359","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","original_name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686baef89b2ba2c5c19a40a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","original_name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686baf0a5abbb69e3d9a41c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","original_name":"Серж Дур-Дачник","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686baf172fd1232682702eb1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":863,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/uN8MBnrVzPype6ECAIpggwBodH3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/r932M2U6fedRyC6Nuxgmcbln7Dd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":816,"name":"walking"},{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":181324,"name":"existentialism"},{"id":183732,"name":"viral video"},{"id":210783,"name":"meme"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":354867,"name":"russian internet"},{"id":354868,"name":"slavic melancholy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
