Despite promises, Johanna never gets a moment's peace from her family. On a trip to a nearby murder scene, Johanna is surrounded by a swarm of mosquitoes. At first the mosquitoes annoy her, but when she finally lets one bite her, she suddenly experiences a deep inner peace. Johanna discovers her more selfish side, and the more the mosquitoes bite, the greater her desire to break away from the family grows. The forces of nature transform her into a mother who crosses all boundaries to satisfy her own needs.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":267291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mylla Films","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":267292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Hand Film & TV","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Bloodsuckers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3146395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elin Grönblom","original_name":"Elin Grönblom","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/4bJpASpfjgsj2ZbYIjEBfA2P48L.jpg","credit_id":"686bc325fa5d5ae83fa95a82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josefine Sonck","original_name":"Josefine Sonck","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686bc334eb6de7aeae9a425b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3146395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elin Grönblom","original_name":"Elin Grönblom","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/4bJpASpfjgsj2ZbYIjEBfA2P48L.jpg","credit_id":"686bc33e99e3aab4f151e06d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2817499,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Inka Hietala","original_name":"Inka Hietala","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686bc348adbf23ebc9a95a96","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3120283,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Petri Kemppinen","original_name":"Petri Kemppinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686bc35333dc7bf3fb6e8432","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrik Andersson","original_name":"Patrik Andersson","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686bc365aecb6dd476cee708","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jakob Abrahamsson","original_name":"Jakob Abrahamsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686bc37048e76658149a4314","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208169,"name":"mosquitoes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
