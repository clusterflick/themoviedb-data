This is an open-ended work in terms of time, blending formats that range from stage performance to audiovisual media, with new episodes added each year. The characters, situations, and settings will be created based on the stories collected from the audience. At the same time, the relationships between the characters and the storyline will evolve over time, intertwining aspects of the real lives of the actors with the impact generated by their efforts to connect with the audience.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":226187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Complejo Teatral de Buenos Aires","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lo que nos queda por contar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
