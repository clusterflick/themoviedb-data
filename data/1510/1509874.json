He has previously been told to have supposedly French roots, so he is trying hard to be as French as in any way possible. One day he cuts his long finger and is certified permanently unfit for work by Doctor Schweizer who is the father of Anneli, Brucco's secret crush. As Brucco is reluctant to accept the life of an early-retiree he is contemplating a career change. So he finally becomes a door-to-door salesman for toys. After a mix-up he also becomes the target of the local mafia.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/vxrVaY3xRQCe9b9vh24gX46fOuY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267308,"logo_path":null,"name":"GigantFilm Produktion Schweiz","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monsieur Brucco: An Albanian and the Two Suitcases","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5549920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John A.
