One little doll named April gets sprinkled and is delighted that she can now talk, walk and sing. She takes off for an adventure into the real world, only to find that not everyone is as nice as the Sandman, especially the clumsy grinch, Bootlace, who wants to capture her and all the other real toys to sell to the highest bidder. But it is Christmas Eve, a time for miracles, and April and the Sandman are about to save the toys and make children's dreams come true.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/icEYDETJzkZtGsaSPUBqYZ81JDY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"April and the Sandman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/icEYDETJzkZtGsaSPUBqYZ81JDY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
