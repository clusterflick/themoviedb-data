As do all his people, Bat confides his family’s protection to a chosen reindeer, the Sacred Reindeer. The animal protects his family from spells, diseases and he is their guardian of happiness. Bat’s Sacred Reindeer has just turned fifteen, which is old for these animals. In a few days the temperature will sink to forty below, and snow will cover everything for eight months. It is time, now, to leave. Bat and his family are moving into the woods. There they will prepare for the cold. The long caravan sets out. For Bat’s Sacred Reindeer, this is the last voyage.","popularity":0.2487,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8606,"logo_path":"/4DjCqjZmIrxnykUJyxHKlvke80L.png","name":"Boréales","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lords of the Animals: The Tsaatan, The Reindeer Riders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Lords of the Animals: The Tsaatan, The Reindeer Riders","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Fougea","original_name":"Frédéric Fougea","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/drsnxwcoSuPLDy2hJqlayp09PdI.jpg","credit_id":"63c5b24f68ff7000a7857465","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Malaterre","original_name":"Jacques Malaterre","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/iJxo3EEkX8aF9AUniGdB6iShYVI.jpg","credit_id":"63c5b261255dba007a339d0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Malaterre","original_name":"Jacques Malaterre","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/iJxo3EEkX8aF9AUniGdB6iShYVI.jpg","credit_id":"63c5b26b12c60400c163598d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
