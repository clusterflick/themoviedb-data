Dashi Namdakov, a descant of darkhans, began to learn the craft not long after a Buryat shaman cured him of a life-threatening illness as a young man. Today he is internationally celebrated as an artist and sculptor. Namdakov carries on his ancestors' ways, working with fire and metal to create art that conveys a Buddhist-shamanic spirituality and a distinct flavor of the supernatural. This 2019 film by Kazakh director Gulshat Omarova offers a glimpse into Namdakov's fascinating life and the creative process that honors his Buryat roots.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/vYkjh7DeHO8ccsPFmOchkod7DmF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blacksmith","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3873388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Bodrov","original_name":"Sergei Bodrov","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63c370da7390c000d548ee70","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gulshat Omarova","original_name":"Gulshat Omarova","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/y7Y0dsUi4pHx92sSULojzLEp59b.jpg","credit_id":"64e248918c0a4800ae2c2591","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gulshat Omarova","original_name":"Gulshat Omarova","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/y7Y0dsUi4pHx92sSULojzLEp59b.jpg","credit_id":"63c370b3aaec710087a95b01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3516936","wikidata_id":"Q26912985","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vYkjh7DeHO8ccsPFmOchkod7DmF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
