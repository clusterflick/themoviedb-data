No. 5\" (1938). The only newsreel that survives of the 38 that were made for theaters between 1936 and 1938. It is made up of 4 reports:  * XII Anniversary of the death of Pablo Iglesias  * Tribute to the Madrid Tramway Workers.  * The Bomb Squad of the Republican Army.  * Shows in the War.  These reports belong to the final part of the anarchist film production in the Spanish Civil War, where, like the rest of the anarchist cinema made at that time, it already adopts a tone in line with the official postulates.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":55730,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNT-FAI","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Momentos de España Nº 5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
