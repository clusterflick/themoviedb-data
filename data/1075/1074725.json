How many people know this singular and important aspect of the great Milanese actor's life? \"Forgotten Activism\" attempts to reconstruct a particular profile of the actor Gian Maria Volonté, the one concerning his political commitment, an aspect that is often neglected and ignored. A life spent on acting, but at the same time on politics, with the fixed idea of always wanting to change things and have his say, denouncing the abuses of power - as in the case of the anarchist Pinelli - and social inequalities. A character that can be defined to all intents and purposes as a fighter, a 'revolutionary in an actor's uniform', who exposed himself without trying to mediate his positions, sometimes extreme and as a true outsider.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/jJSy7vqBlfOzSNCkw0ahsTw1P7O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159429,"logo_path":null,"name":"AAMOD - Archivio Audiovisivo del Movimento Operaio e Democratico","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Activism","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gian Maria Volonté","original_name":"Gian Maria Volonté","popularity":0.4797,"profile_path":"/8SFKKlHsNZyfWzF5OVWVqP0dTEJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"63c55e1cb7d35200a01e2540","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3920108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oreste Scalzone","original_name":"Oreste Scalzone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63eb5d4a699fb70084e0ef3d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645591,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Silvia Orengo","original_name":"Silvia Orengo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c55e90a6725400b59e27c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrizio Partino","original_name":"Patrizio Partino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c55e405f2b8d007d66b540","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrizio Partino","original_name":"Patrizio Partino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c55e6ba6725400e92fdc9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrizio Partino","original_name":"Patrizio Partino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c55e50b7d35200bdfbf06b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344900,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paolo Ballarini","original_name":"Paolo Ballarini","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb5e8ef92532007f1b7e76","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2412146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luigi Montebello","original_name":"Luigi Montebello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb5dcb813cb600dc06abdf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrizio Partino","original_name":"Patrizio Partino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb5e1c813cb600c66beada","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3920111,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Germano Evangelisti","original_name":"Germano Evangelisti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63eb5d878e870200dc7c0ae3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7676142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jJSy7vqBlfOzSNCkw0ahsTw1P7O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":648},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/10e4Exn91BdXT55yODzed3sGa4B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
