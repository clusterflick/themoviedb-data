A hungry bohemian painter invokes his muse to help him to produce the winning painting, and when he experiments with scenes set in Mexico, Argentina and Spain, his paintings come to life. In Xochimilco, Mexico, a young bachelor has a drunken dream that his girl friend is performing Josephine Baker's famous banana dance in a Parisian nightclub. In Buenos Aires, an Italian and a Galician are rivals for the affections of a Creole girl. At the other side of the Hispanic world, a Sevillian girl tells of her tragic romance with a matador, who obstinately continues to appear in the ring despite having been injured.","popularity":0.5184,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charros, gauchos y manolas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1828955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Castillo","original_name":"Carmen Castillo","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f02e54d5d007dbf1501","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":942244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delia Magaña","original_name":"Delia Magaña","popularity":0.3147,"profile_path":"/2ci6pyyLUs6n4JsrnqH4xHTGQis.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f0d255dba007a339508","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3876197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Pedraza","original_name":"Samuel Pedraza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f13ad59b500be05b984","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Gómez Don Chema","original_name":"Carlos Gómez Don Chema","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f1a255dba008a27a37a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Ellis","original_name":"Paul Ellis","popularity":0.1378,"profile_path":"/iQyvFolA1RTOSbyfvhgOnHcrSVA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f29255dba00b6d64512","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Granada","original_name":"Carmen Granada","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f30c9054f00a72385e0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicente Padula","original_name":"Vicente Padula","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":"/5xuUebpz2Wokmpr0E2AuZh2vubG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f3770b44400910e438d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3876198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Lucanti","original_name":"Carlos Lucanti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f4255c92600a0f21f01","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Alba","original_name":"Maria Alba","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":"/ySHV5kXMwsnMJEU89ZxXFZhtXO0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f4dad59b500db65d1a9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martín Garralaga","original_name":"Martín Garralaga","popularity":0.6112,"profile_path":"/tmXwvyHlxPhfig7qKhzIRxfid3Y.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f55255dba0080fb6f88","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Ortiz","original_name":"Marina Ortiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f5f12c60400ae1d2aad","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Peña","original_name":"José Peña","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f6b55c926007d451009","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romualdo Tirado","original_name":"Romualdo Tirado","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/35RuHX3hj4ww3Z1888XnGEfTurO.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"63c58f7270b44400b669c777","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Cugat","original_name":"Xavier Cugat","popularity":0.1913,"profile_path":"/pZqbwaJrOK44EMrEpwKc6Dd5G9z.jpg","credit_id":"63c58ef1c9054f00da8b2ea1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Cugat","original_name":"Xavier Cugat","popularity":0.1913,"profile_path":"/pZqbwaJrOK44EMrEpwKc6Dd5G9z.jpg","credit_id":"63c58eec55c926009445fd78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0353287","wikidata_id":"Q5086673","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
