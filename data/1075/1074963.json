She realizes that her needy husband, Fritz, is more dangerous and deranged than he appears. His years of physical and mental manipulation, through the use of food and their relationship, all comes to the ugly surface. Inge gets inspired to stand up for herself after watching a marathon of her favorite trashy soap opera, taking the melodrama to heart. She plays Fritz at his own game of manipulation and unravels the cold and grotesque truth of their relationship, pushing both of them to their absolute limits.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everythingeater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3316464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Acevedo","original_name":"Hugo Acevedo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fritz","credit_id":"63c7010ecf4a640091a55a58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hailey Hudson","original_name":"Hailey Hudson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"63c701104e6742007dbaafe3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Kubart","original_name":"Chad Kubart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"TV Voice #2 (voice)","credit_id":"63c70110cf4a6400a7311a8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Massey","original_name":"Katherine Massey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"TV Voice #4 (voice)","credit_id":"63c701145ad76b009f0ba031","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Hartsman","original_name":"Danny Hartsman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"TV Voice #3 (voice)","credit_id":"63c70117bbd0b0008a9150a7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3876638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Schmidt","original_name":"Maximilian Schmidt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Vomit Sounds (uncredited)","credit_id":"63c70119cf4a64007d758184","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janelle Basich-Mustafa","original_name":"Janelle Basich-Mustafa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Inge","credit_id":"63c7011a303c8500a0c96d50","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Kucmierz","original_name":"Andrew Kucmierz","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Chet","credit_id":"63c7011dde11e50094b9e650","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ron Stacker Thompson","original_name":"Ron Stacker Thompson","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"TV Voice #1 (voice)","credit_id":"63c701276905fb00ae1543f4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3876638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Schmidt","original_name":"Maximilian Schmidt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5db97c9054f00899951f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22028870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
