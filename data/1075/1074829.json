We see the many hours of work that “ASMR artists” put into making their videos – and their presence and sincerity. In the age of anxiety, ASMR aspires to fulfill our ancient, primal needs. We are all a bit broken, but human beings are incredibly inventive when it comes to finding ways to reach out to our kind.","popularity":0.184,"poster_path":"/oNgRyg9jPyBvj4C1fRHfDkZMdJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10877,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinocompany","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kind Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3876256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sini Hormio","original_name":"Sini Hormio","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5975212c60400c16353c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3372033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anu Silfverberg","original_name":"Anu Silfverberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c59765ad59b501d59bf355","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3372033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anu Silfverberg","original_name":"Anu Silfverberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5976f255dba0091813632","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2252919,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Samu Kuukka","original_name":"Samu Kuukka","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c597ccc9054f00da8b314d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656470,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hans Wessels","original_name":"Hans Wessels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5980be54d5d0094a87077","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janne Laine","original_name":"Janne Laine","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/7RMPfxYRGusRg2KDyMLr1xUxbq9.jpg","credit_id":"63c5981c12c6040085d8df61","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2488482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sonja Huttunen","original_name":"Sonja Huttunen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c597f6e54d5d00db8d0b80","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101416,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ari Matikainen","original_name":"Ari Matikainen","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c597a3c9054f0089994348","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3876256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sini Hormio","original_name":"Sini Hormio","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c59748c9054f0089994326","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1805960,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jarkko Virtanen","original_name":"Jarkko Virtanen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c597de70b44400b669c9ae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oNgRyg9jPyBvj4C1fRHfDkZMdJj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocPoint Helsinki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
