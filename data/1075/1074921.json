The latter comprises a range of cyclic panning and tilting actions, which relate and respond to the actual movements of the carriages and perceived movements of windows and landscapes, inside and outside the train. This palette of repeating actions was then choreographed into a seamless continuum inspired by the natural rhythms encountered during the journey. The film is designed to be viewed in a stretched, anamorphic format to draw the material away from conventional representation towards kinaesthetic abstraction.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2U8al4FpxMHBFxZ6lbvs6WOj4WB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Track","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Sercombe","original_name":"Martin Sercombe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5c347e54d5d00854d7298","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2U8al4FpxMHBFxZ6lbvs6WOj4WB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
