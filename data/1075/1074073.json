To survive, Sankōkai Fourth-Generation Chairman Daiki Yabuta (Kenji Matsuda) plans to create a new yakuza group led by Okita Shōhei (Yasukaze Motomiyac) from Washio-gumi. This group aims to unify yakuza nationwide, similar to the former Tendokai under Kazuma Washio (Hitoshi Ozawa).  Meanwhile, within Nihon Tōgōsha, Kazuma Washio is expanding his influence, prompting the leader Tōjō (Kentarō Shimazu) to take action and plot Washio’s assassination. However, the plan leads to unexpected outcomes...  Additionally, a letter sent to Washio-gumi and other national yakuza organizations pushes Okita and the others into even greater peril.","popularity":0.8758,"poster_path":"/dPoOsGBbtMxxbT29ycxQJHdhFWU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CONFLICT VIII","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢仁志","popularity":0.8392,"profile_path":"/m2mLrkCcttT2fgHBMfObbq6G0sw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63c34ff5871b3400c3b04322","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2553624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"SHU","original_name":"SHU","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/3mRKclUDCtM9O6FMZJuu55G8fLl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63c35001ce997a00cfe95d32","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"IZAM","original_name":"IZAM","popularity":0.1658,"profile_path":"/46leS5sG5t78X8I0v6GnAYXA2oW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63c3500d0231f20091a26ac3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasukaze Motomiya","original_name":"本宮泰風","popularity":0.7318,"profile_path":"/psL6KI2IktDBICsrEw4zKDKdnOe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63c350197390c000a2f7cb9d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口祥行","popularity":0.4173,"profile_path":"/jAaHxP854jQzsqRhx6vCQ05hwHc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63c350240231f200826a6018","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken'ichi Fujiwara","original_name":"藤原健一","popularity":0.5784,"profile_path":"/hikB8bVmjqy6jbqfC6m0UcxskS2.jpg","credit_id":"63c35034871b3400c3b04364","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dPoOsGBbtMxxbT29ycxQJHdhFWU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1058}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
