This programme charts the remarkable success and progress of the world's first turbojet-powered airliner and its evolution into a front-line aircraft of the Royal Air Force. The Nimrod was the world's first land-based pure jet aircraft built for anti-submarine duties and long-range maritime patrol. The Nimrod's ability to detect surface and subsurface movements was outstanding and ensured that even under the waves the enemy had no place to hide.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gHhnlWzlh7YIjjuIRS1I0KDBxND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History of Aviation: The Nimrod","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2498015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Hitchcock","original_name":"Stanley Hitchcock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c332070231f2007d6ad56d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2411,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHhnlWzlh7YIjjuIRS1I0KDBxND.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1607}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
