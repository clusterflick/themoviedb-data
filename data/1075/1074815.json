Anibal González (Don Cony) and his brother Christian González (Kitty), were born and raised in the neighborhood. Today they try to survive while writing songs of denunciation about the reality they have to live. Los Olvidados begins with archival footage from 2012 in which a young man from Marconi is killed by police, and ends in 2016 with the death of another young man in similar circumstances. The film shows the neighborhood through Don Cony and Kitty in the interim between these two police events.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yhYS3BAtJzC0uiiEqbLf60Gh3Rl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trapecistas
