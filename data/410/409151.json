Many considered the entry of these courageous underdogs, racing as a team of 4 against teams of 10, a joke. One French journalist called their attempt nothing short of murder. 168 riders started the more than 3,500-mile race, only 41 finished. Surprisingly this remarkable story about the achievements of these brave athletes has never been told on film, until now. Phil Keoghan - television personality, adventurer and cycling enthusiast, retraces the 1928 Tour de France route, bringing history to life. Following the original course and schedule, riding a vintage bike, Phil and his team will average 150 miles a day for 22 stages.","popularity":0.3089,"poster_path":"/s01m1ApPdsczyax1x1GgVfngLb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Retracing the 1928 Tour de France","title":"Le Ride","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069717,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip Keoghan","original_name":"Philip Keoghan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Philip Keoghan","credit_id":"5df0a8d0dc86470013c8dd0f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Keoghan","original_name":"Phil Keoghan","popularity":0.1657,"profile_path":"/c0i6fHpeW6qtsrl1mXlEgIuaevp.jpg","credit_id":"57a574fd9251410eb1001b99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1858530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Keoghan","original_name":"Louise Keoghan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5978f8f8c3a368685a0005a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5279204","wikidata_id":"Q26252684","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJQWJK13AWbCUDnZQZ8DofeUgXD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2990,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s01m1ApPdsczyax1x1GgVfngLb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1993},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fiOeV7XnZXkbhKH8RC27jZrdLoq.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2019-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"NZIFF","release_date":"2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
