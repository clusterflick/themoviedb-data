As Mount Fuji is climbed across geographical, temporal and cultural divides, the narrative unfolds, exploring unexpected paths.","popularity":0.7162,"poster_path":"/ZwW7qlfrkxMnANZnAk6zppgUIW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antithesis Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ascent","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroki Hasegawa","original_name":"長谷川博己","popularity":0.4651,"profile_path":"/aWfpj9ndyDq2xsSrABRRscAkcaa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hiroshi","credit_id":"57d7deaa9251415329003087","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Tan","original_name":"Fiona Tan","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/tQGwVuSHb4TNKlDLXeWJdtGeTVV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57d7df0ec3a3682b540045a8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Tan","original_name":"Fiona Tan","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/tQGwVuSHb4TNKlDLXeWJdtGeTVV.jpg","credit_id":"579e9991c3a3681832001012","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Tan","original_name":"Fiona Tan","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/tQGwVuSHb4TNKlDLXeWJdtGeTVV.jpg","credit_id":"5ac680d2c3a36834db014f63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587608,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Dijkstal","original_name":"Hugo Dijkstal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac680e40e0a26496e01644a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235082,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nathalie Alonso Casale","original_name":"Nathalie Alonso Casale","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac680ea0e0a26497a0162b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Tan","original_name":"Fiona Tan","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/tQGwVuSHb4TNKlDLXeWJdtGeTVV.jpg","credit_id":"5ac680cc92514162a20152a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016597,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Anemaet","original_name":"Leo Anemaet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac680dc0e0a264977016d78","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5933966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":2970,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ZwW7qlfrkxMnANZnAk6zppgUIW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jtJ0C5Q7D9e6hmutKLQ8su5yjdp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":1262,"name":"mountain"},{"id":3124,"name":"cloud"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2016-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2017-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Göteborg Film Festival","release_date":"2017-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York City, New York","release_date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
