The director’s first film documents the boat trip he took along India’s sacred river with his helmsman, Gopal. They pass tourists and locals, witnessing them bathe, work, or meditate. The film captures the imagination of the endless circle of life and death, which is rooted in the lives of the Indian people, and is convincingly manifested in the way they bid farewell to the dead.","popularity":0.1754,"poster_path":"/ajTXz8cRtZbBb7EHHPSFsPJaFKw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1994-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boatman","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gopal Maji","original_name":"Gopal Maji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Boatman","credit_id":"587520e09251416ab900163b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianfranco Rosi","original_name":"Gianfranco Rosi","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/6C25pVZm9D8Yx4YIJf5NKsGoFqk.jpg","credit_id":"60c983b318864b004016f56f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianfranco Rosi","original_name":"Gianfranco Rosi","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/6C25pVZm9D8Yx4YIJf5NKsGoFqk.jpg","credit_id":"60c983c26654080056b9b45d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianfranco Rosi","original_name":"Gianfranco Rosi","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/6C25pVZm9D8Yx4YIJf5NKsGoFqk.jpg","credit_id":"60c983bb48333a0079baa299","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianfranco Rosi","original_name":"Gianfranco Rosi","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/6C25pVZm9D8Yx4YIJf5NKsGoFqk.jpg","credit_id":"57ac1306c3a368766b0006ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16335,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jacopo Quadri","original_name":"Jacopo Quadri","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/41msk0CiuTO5hazrBuJaZ8RumzN.jpg","credit_id":"5875207b9251416abc001691","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106445","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rTH57AikOLzBJtQmZ81gwUwUzyp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2688,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ajTXz8cRtZbBb7EHHPSFsPJaFKw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1792},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2688,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v45I5oByZ2Ro0wWFVo5nl9C9HFI.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1792},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7ofF5QxXQ1qeYyFLG5J95WIJFY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TV Premiere","release_date":"1996-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (Sundance Film Festival)","release_date":"1994-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gianfranco Rosi - Le Passeur (Boatman) (1993)","key":"HD89Nt9kx6E","published_at":"2012-05-31T12:54:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57ac1335c3a36878f20006b8"}]}}}
