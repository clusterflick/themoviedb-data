Within its walls, there are resonances, portraits of illustrious or unknown people, books, souvenirs, furniture from different periods and styles. At the heart of this secret order is a woman who has been portrayed throughout her life by painters of the Belle Epoque, by neoclassical sculptors, by avant-garde photographers. To reconstruct the history of these women, each of the visitors will create a fable, in which the essential names of the 20th-century culture are intertwined. Among the visitor to Victoria Ocampo's mansion we can mention the architect  Le Corbusier, the composer Igor Stravinsky, the writers Graham Greene, Aldous Huxley, Waldo Frank, Albert Camus... You will also hear the whisper of two young writers cementing what will be a bond that will last for decades: Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges...","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tres fábulas de Villa Ocampo","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Moguillansky","original_name":"Alejo Moguillansky","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/e3Rgu4bdkeK4KkbwmcMrRu8Jo3W.jpg","credit_id":"57b8983f9251410deb009e44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Llinás","original_name":"Mariano Llinás","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/dfCOcnGqMXzr8BdaHHQ9ohdGfvN.jpg","credit_id":"57b8983692514110ca000064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1990371","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
