A territorial conflict born more than one hundred years ago, during the Paraguay war. While fighting against the Brazilian Congress in order not to be evicted from their homes, the 50.000 indigenous people demand the demarcation of the space that belongs to them. With some rigorous investigative work, the Brazilian director tells with his own voice of the social and political injustices suffered by the Guarani people through material he filmed over the course of more than forty years. The archive images, both color and black and white, reveal the crudeness with which they coexist every day: among the violation of their civil rights and the guts with which they confront the usurpers.","popularity":0.1022,"poster_path":"/hvakzK3XpIMtxl2TkhElpo4HlVu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":162,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martyrdom","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1906548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatiana Almeida","original_name":"Tatiana Almeida","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jaqGidvVLCdBDkHJxwyIN8VBFfa.jpg","credit_id":"6293cb9bab5e34004f3f68a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernesto de Carvalho","original_name":"Ernesto de Carvalho","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6293cba9aa659e00a2566529","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernesto de Carvalho","original_name":"Ernesto de Carvalho","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a0f19d925141056d002c9b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660412,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olívia Sabino","original_name":"Olívia Sabino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a0f1b1c3a36812370012e4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Carelli","original_name":"Vincent Carelli","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a0f179925141676700050d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Carelli","original_name":"Vincent Carelli","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e44d40c3a36846ae024325","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1906548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatiana Almeida","original_name":"Tatiana Almeida","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jaqGidvVLCdBDkHJxwyIN8VBFfa.jpg","credit_id":"59e44d48c3a368463a020e63","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1906548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatiana Almeida","original_name":"Tatiana Almeida","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jaqGidvVLCdBDkHJxwyIN8VBFfa.jpg","credit_id":"59e44d54c3a36846cc027410","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6788828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1MY5LChNxGfCiDMTt5LjMfl8k2.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":964,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hvakzK3XpIMtxl2TkhElpo4HlVu.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":650},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s1qA29PWqAyLUU5om0RCjWUgf9C.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
