Narrated by Geoffrey Palmer, it is a fitting tribute to a man whose mission above all was to proclaim the joy of faith in a troubled world.  He arrived at the Vatican an unknown Polish cardinal and became one of the most towering figures in modern history. All the triumphs and trials of his extraordinary Papacy are here: from his election to the Holy See through his exhaustive world travels, from the shocking attempt on his life and his heroic role in ending Communism. Includes exclusive footage from the only television interview granted after Pope John Paul II was elected to the papacy.","popularity":0.2616,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52763,"logo_path":"/uFal0NhO0adQfmgwOW3mhd6OzzW.png","name":"BBC Manchester","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A BBC commemoration of the life and times of St John Paul II","title":"Pope John Paul II: 1920 - 2005","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Palmer","original_name":"Geoffrey Palmer","popularity":0.5179,"profile_path":"/wfFydeTnTIdtu8oKcY7SCo7u7pg.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"579e684792514177f5003680","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659352,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Ennis","original_name":"Susan Ennis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e6607c3a3684bd7004709","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Standford","original_name":"Peter Standford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e67eb92514110ac002ec0","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helen Bullough","original_name":"Helen Bullough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e682ac3a3684b8a0045fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659344,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pete Coley","original_name":"Pete Coley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e652bc3a3681db8003809","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659350,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gregory Millar","original_name":"Gregory Millar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e65cc925141106b0030b8","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659371,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Juliette Squair","original_name":"Juliette Squair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e678ec3a3683ced003246","department":"Crew","job":"Production Office Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cormac Tohill","original_name":"Cormac Tohill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e658fc3a3683d660030a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659357,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andy Donaldson","original_name":"Andy Donaldson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e6685c3a3683ced0031aa","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659374,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Reynolds","original_name":"Dave Reynolds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e6807c3a3682577007078","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Neil Mitchell","original_name":"Neil Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e656d9251413ab30070a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659351,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anita Walsh","original_name":"Anita Walsh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e65f8c3a3681db800387e","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659372,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lorna-Dawn Creanor","original_name":"Lorna-Dawn Creanor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e67b0c3a3683d660031dc","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659348,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Pickering","original_name":"Stuart Pickering","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e657fc3a3684b8a0044de","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659353,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Stewart","original_name":"Mike Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e662cc3a3682577006fb4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
