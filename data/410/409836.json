She won the Toronto Canadian National Exhibition prize after Florence Chadwick, a then-famous American swimmer who was widely expected to win, dropped out in the middle of the race. Half of this heart-warming movie is devoted to the 21 hour swim in which the 16-year old Bell is exhorted by her pushy coach Gus Ryder not to give up.","popularity":0.3663,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart: The Marilyn Bell Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Dhavernas","original_name":"Caroline Dhavernas","popularity":0.658,"profile_path":"/p3yP2JVSqcZGXUeLnuiJMBXERjF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marilyn Bell","credit_id":"5c355ef10e0a2654b5d9c5b6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":261280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manon Briand","original_name":"Manon Briand","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/s8cIqbsVy1EQTeXlc3YvZwJuyf4.jpg","credit_id":"57b8919a9251410daa009b30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215835","wikidata_id":"Q4309893","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
