Combining elements of theater, radio, and filmmaking, they were produced at a moment when TV technology was growing more mobile and art was being made accessible to a newly suburban postwar demographic. These astonishingly choreographed, brilliantly acted, and socially progressive “teleplays” constituted an artistic high for the medium, bringing Broadway-quality drama to all of America. The award-winning programs included in this box set—originally curated for PBS in the early 1980s as the series The Golden Age of Television, featuring recollections from key cast and crew members—were conceived by such up-and-comers as Rod Serling and John Frankenheimer and star the likes of Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, Julie Harris, and Piper Laurie.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/gqOSZE1TTl4qw9nqHDSkasWL1sm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10932,"logo_path":"/AscjWwkpQC23EZgRxbeOqs4KhRI.png","name":"The Criterion Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":480,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Age of Television","video":true,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1063408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gqOSZE1TTl4qw9nqHDSkasWL1sm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1376},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fvlXMvvbug1pJuq3QlhbRkau3er.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1288}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
