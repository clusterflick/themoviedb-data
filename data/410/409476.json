The bookstore, like her love life, is not experiencing much success. This all changes when she meets and falls in love with the unlikeliest candidate in the world, Nat, a male model, who has never read a book in his life and is desperate to be loved for his mind not his body. Against the odds, they become romantically involved but then Sashi, Nat's now pregnant ex-girlfriend, shows up and sets off a chain of romantic complications into motion.","popularity":0.1628,"poster_path":"/jEr7gN23hZLmv6Lwt9qWu0u1pDs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Me Sweet Something","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Gumede","original_name":"Thomas Gumede","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zplJkXcqhBmL2FUmMOwOn4KWAo9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gordon","credit_id":"57a2b0b3c3a3682356000e34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maps Maponyane","original_name":"Maps Maponyane","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nat","credit_id":"57a2b0bec3a3682641002e1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1661171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nomzamo Mbatha","original_name":"Nomzamo Mbatha","popularity":0.6744,"profile_path":"/1awbUooZuQvMSThenXjXRYfxcFe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Moratiwa","credit_id":"57a2b0c9c3a3686c1a001c57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makhaola Ndebele","original_name":"Makhaola Ndebele","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/4o37GivkVIJdaNWD0BsWXzYGcVc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Electrician","credit_id":"57a2b0dac3a3682641002e3b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thembi Seete","original_name":"Thembi Seete","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/qgy2xV88YgrY26N0H2EbzCLy6uq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lola","credit_id":"57a2b0e2c3a3686c1a001c63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thishiwe Ziqubu","original_name":"Thishiwe Ziqubu","popularity":0.1533,"profile_path":"/waUnn0CJBjW22BnQFcj8lJtctOy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tshaka","credit_id":"57a2b0ed925141411a0028a0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akin Omotoso","original_name":"Akin Omotoso","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/49IQy9bmSvUfvAaIsjqIgEogWHX.jpg","credit_id":"57a2b057c3a3686c4a001ccf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akin Omotoso","original_name":"Akin Omotoso","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/49IQy9bmSvUfvAaIsjqIgEogWHX.jpg","credit_id":"57a2b068c3a3686c4a001cd6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661169,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robbie Thorpe","original_name":"Robbie Thorpe","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a2b08e9251411545000e03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4573706","wikidata_id":"Q24807169","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jEr7gN23hZLmv6Lwt9qWu0u1pDs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
