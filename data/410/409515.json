Her rather lonely existence is characterized by hard work and poverty and as her mother's condition worsens there doesn't seem to be a way out anymore. Ecce homo is a parable about being human, rich in religious symbolism, which dreamily and at the same time sombrely poses existential questions without volunteering answers.","popularity":0.121,"poster_path":"/qDbpFLfaZiHqLxlrkQp6EJkZVwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edinburgh Skillset Screen and Media
