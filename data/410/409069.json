The film charts two journeys, from rural South Africa under apartheid and the rolling hills of Southern California, to the starting line of the women’s 3,000 metres. It uncovers a tale of betrayal and exploitation, of the blurred lines between politics, media and sport, and of the dedication and sacrifice required to compete at the highest level. It’s a story that split governments and divided nations, but at its heart is a tale of two young women who, despite the turmoil in their lives, just wanted to run.","popularity":0.703,"poster_path":"/qz6FXPDobOutDB2bmjupjFtCxmJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hillside
