The documentary exposes in a moving way the difficult relationship between a daughter and her heroic, mythified father. At the same time it also becomes not only the reflection of a daughter but of an entire generation, about the feelings of abandoment, abscense, the tragedy, the exile and death. Feelings, ideas, dreams and facts are confronted. Tears are shed as much as admiration is expressed for the father, he is questioned as strongly as he is veneered.","popularity":0.113,"poster_path":"/sYagaJt8t6pcBPKD4PTow9mwtt6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14171,"logo_path":"/p9GWxbK3INIi1RJJBUzVNjmsEkC.png","name":"Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica (CCC)","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2004-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papá Iván","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46861,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fernando Pardo","original_name":"Fernando Pardo","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/qU4pjTaoJdeNwLp1bKQYQcXHAKd.jpg","credit_id":"6259aad0f548361427dd9254","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Arango De Montis","original_name":"Carlos Arango De Montis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259aaf95e120012c507ab9f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1284155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lena Esquenazi","original_name":"Lena Esquenazi","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/35mcWdqrhaouIXQ7nud2N9SanLZ.jpg","credit_id":"6259ab0ee5593700508174aa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Rodríguez","original_name":"Hugo Rodríguez","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259aae73acd20162abe6272","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Inés Roqué","original_name":"María Inés Roqué","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ab515292514110e4002da1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Inés Roqué","original_name":"María Inés Roqué","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ab515ac3a368519c001ad6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0276389","wikidata_id":"Q5413479","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dLXo5GkfvMsgXU0eUmtl2r6WAjF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":2788,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sYagaJt8t6pcBPKD4PTow9mwtt6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Escenarios.
