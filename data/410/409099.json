Through dance, lives are told, memories recounted:  regrets, bitterness, moments of joy and solitude. Blanche Moreau is 92 years old. During the filming, she has fallen in love with the choreographer Thierry. The simple fact of falling in love being crazy enough as it is, there’s no longer anything else mad or delirious about Blanche: her illness has simply become lovesickness.","popularity":0.1817,"poster_path":"/lLWNFkPpdIFnDz4tNB3cjnOmncl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Young Girl in Her Nineties","video":false,"vote_average":6.056,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","original_name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","popularity":0.595,"profile_path":"/ioMCjkUWngWjS0nXWYLqvBsm4mI.jpg","credit_id":"579e937fc3a3681832000bbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156604,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yann Coridian","original_name":"Yann Coridian","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579e938b92514136bb000bb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","original_name":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","popularity":0.595,"profile_path":"/ioMCjkUWngWjS0nXWYLqvBsm4mI.jpg","credit_id":"57fceb04c3a3681b4500630a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156604,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yann Coridian","original_name":"Yann Coridian","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fceb0ec3a36819ae006a65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577909,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sandy Notarianni","original_name":"Sandy Notarianni","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e4d01fd036b60083ad5940","department":"Sound","job":"Supervising Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5938418","wikidata_id":"Q26908499","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lLWNFkPpdIFnDz4tNB3cjnOmncl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2016-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Roche-sur-Yon International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2017-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
