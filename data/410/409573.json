People rinse out pots in the tank and clean their freshly picked vegetables. If they simply pour the food scraps back in the water, they risk polluting the whole village supply. However, carp can scour out even the greasy or burnt pans. They do the washing up in Satoyama villages. This traditional arrangement is called the riverside method. It’s used all over Japan. Cleaned up by the carp, the tank water eventually rejoins the channel.","popularity":0.4553,"poster_path":"/zWcP0GTxEu5reXtEx18w7Q4TBVz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satoyama II: Japan's Secret Watergarden","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Satoyama I","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","title":"SATOYAMA: Khu Vườn Thủy Sinh Tuyệt Vời","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Satoyama Japans' Secret Watergarden","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Satoyama Japans Secret Water Garden","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"里山：日本神秘水上花园","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Attenborough","original_name":"David Attenborough","popularity":1.4236,"profile_path":"/tt3LW3XftcvxOZtMXmIaJSWFN7y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b736037c3a368188620e719","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Masayuki Shimoyamada","original_name":"Masayuki Shimoyamada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7360d90e0a267eeb1d5119","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masumi Mizunuma","original_name":"Masumi Mizunuma","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7361950e0a267ef41bf3a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0483154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s10wA7BeUwUT8iZlwtIWnObv6XZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hzR2zFhc2Ur12X7kkKn6Fs44Sz4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWcP0GTxEu5reXtEx18w7Q4TBVz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
