Right from the instant of his death, the idea arose to retain, focus on, and seize the spark that had just disappeared. This would be done by reconstructing, through several hundred interviews over nearly thirty years, the puzzle of this thinker who, under his flamboyant strolling player exterior that celebrated art and life like a party, was extraordinarily true to himself, and from a truly cultural background with which he irrigated the field of action of cinema. His energy, enthusiasm and implacable conviction should excite, move, enlighten, surprise, and provide food for thought, well beyond the professional context that was his, to an era that sorely needs it.","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":"/8ZclofMkHr30ub95uZXhiO3z0uh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1873,"logo_path":"/911T70eQ0qxId7NN31zV8YpMWFE.png","name":"Sophie Dulac Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":66331,"logo_path":"/n2gAOEA4q6bUiaHwo2mKWHGA1wm.png","name":"Bonne Pioche","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toscan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Toscan du Plantier","original_name":"Daniel Toscan du Plantier","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/6DJQt3cBBqUkwiBbwLUQ7YMMFvW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"57a02f4ec3a3682a750019fe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660126,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isabelle Partiot-Pieri","original_name":"Isabelle Partiot-Pieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a02f61c3a3682abf001a35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660127,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vincent Lefebvre","original_name":"Vincent Lefebvre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a02f7b9251412c62001973","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1371283,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nadine Verdier","original_name":"Nadine Verdier","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a02f899251412362001e08","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yves Darondeau","original_name":"Yves Darondeau","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/98TYJVBU9WEZzCnJV4CvrDarM8v.jpg","credit_id":"596132b89251410bfa0c6d64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christophe Lioud","original_name":"Christophe Lioud","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/1HBMqYh1cGwKOSihu8GtCOTZBUl.jpg","credit_id":"596132bf9251410a590c0df8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emmanuel Priou","original_name":"Emmanuel Priou","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/bEvSkTfTfxdr1LA26eysTB6CXUh.jpg","credit_id":"596132c79251415a40092657","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurence Picollec","original_name":"Laurence Picollec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596132d1c3a368293b0c99a3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660126,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isabelle Partiot-Pieri","original_name":"Isabelle Partiot-Pieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596132d89251417904029257","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1608635","wikidata_id":"Q3532596","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8ZclofMkHr30ub95uZXhiO3z0uh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2010-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
