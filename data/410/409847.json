This documentary gives us a brief glimpse into her life there: We explore her relationships with her brother, husband and closest friend, who live there too. The focus remains on those relationships in order to present the viewer the simple understanding that we are all fundamentally human - We all share the same moments of grief, joy, sadness and love. Underpinning this lies the deeper socio-cultural issue of mental health. This is not a film about 'crazy' people - It is a film about people and humanity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's That: The Three Loves of Vala","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Pax McDowell","original_name":"Simon Pax McDowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ab39038469a0072480c96","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santa Aumeistere","original_name":"Santa Aumeistere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ab3a12ea6b900463b0d40","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Pax McDowell","original_name":"Simon Pax McDowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ab36b1bf876005e087cb6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Pax McDowell","original_name":"Simon Pax McDowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ab37ee61e6d00754eb139","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zak Campbell","original_name":"Zak Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610ab3b98d22fc005fa41bec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Pax McDowell","original_name":"Simon Pax McDowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b892049251416174001340","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santa Aumeistere","original_name":"Santa Aumeistere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b891f4925141429500d0a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zak Campbell","original_name":"Zak Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b891fcc3a368642d0014c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4434372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
