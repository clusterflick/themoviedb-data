The film delves into the lives of ordinary women from different races, educational levels and social classes. Filmed mostly in small consciousness-raising groups, from which the women's movement grew, the women talk about the daily realities of their lives as wives, home-makers, and workers. They speak, sometimes with hesitancy, often with passion, about the oppression of women as they see it.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/iSSXSpvZwsVp3nH4T08Y04NJNoQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224875,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Newsreel Film Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman's Film","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judy Smith","original_name":"Judy Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8979a925141429500d44e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1148245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Alaimo","original_name":"Louise Alaimo","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8978f9251410d5600a1a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Sorren","original_name":"Ellen Sorren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b897a29251410daa009f4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0235063","wikidata_id":"Q122929123","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iSSXSpvZwsVp3nH4T08Y04NJNoQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
