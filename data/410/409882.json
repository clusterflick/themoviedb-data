During that previous one, the owner of the house shows his friends his first short film (Porno de Autor). A story about two teenagers and the relationship of one of them with the older brother of the other. The concept of the short, which proposes to tell a story in a very natural and everyday way, full of details and above all of sexual tension, ends up moving, inevitably, to the group of friends.","popularity":0.1243,"poster_path":"/eO1hlPOvtiQqAEtPBmt0JjwT1Vt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77289,"logo_path":"/784gvswTQxRf9b6zgUXFiqiYMtb.png","name":"Primer Plano Film
