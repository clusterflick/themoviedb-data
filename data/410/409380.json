He's a polite and quiet boy, and the local students always make fun of him just because he's from Bangkok. He later becomes friend with Oud, a local bad-boy who is really a good guy inside. Just like any other teenagers, Min falls in love at first sight with Fang, a pretty girl from the same school, but this love is going to be tough because of the opposition of Fang's father.","popularity":0.2917,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":80005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bell Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2006-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Friend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Khae pheuan kha phaw","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Khae Phuan Kha Pho","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phrompon Sithimongkol","original_name":"Phrompon Sithimongkol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Min","credit_id":"57a1b76e9251415f2c000803","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thanamit Reuanghiran","original_name":"Thanamit Reuanghiran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Oud","credit_id":"57a1b76592514167ae006167","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanokwan Thananchai","original_name":"Kanokwan Thananchai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Fang","credit_id":"57a1b77792514108eb008be5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Apichart Chusakul","original_name":"Apichart Chusakul","popularity":0.1473,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fang's Dad","credit_id":"57fa863fc3a3686ffa00ac21","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verapong Kanchananit","original_name":"Verapong Kanchananit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a1b787c3a3680ce10008ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0780056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18425,"name":"teenage love"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
