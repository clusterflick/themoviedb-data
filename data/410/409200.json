It is a modernist (and very Soviet) look at a young girl’s interaction with the world around her and displays many of the strengths of the director’s later work, including his attention to milieu and his sensitivity to young performers. -http://www.vulture.com/2009/07/in_soviet_russia_nikita_mikhal.html","popularity":0.0926,"poster_path":"/Agxv4GmY4OLKSkquHdFFQvzJl3A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl and Things","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608124,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Igor Klebanov","original_name":"Игорь Клебанов","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hXnmU7oBSAxIHvMC5Lt3eQtnYqx.jpg","credit_id":"624e709124f2ce009ddd2514","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Mikhalkov","original_name":"Никита Михалков","popularity":0.9097,"profile_path":"/6CWVKIf3LwkfpjfJPBj8toBzeQv.jpg","credit_id":"579fa41ac3a3683bd70033da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0061566","wikidata_id":"Q4156428","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1534,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Agxv4GmY4OLKSkquHdFFQvzJl3A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
