Saeed and Atefeh's own house has even been taken over by a Polish Jewish family, who, it transpires, are holding Farhan hostage. It is up to the couple, with the assistance of Farhan's steely grandmother, to find a way to reclaim their lost son. One of the few Iranian films to tackle the Palestinian issue from a historical perspective, this stunning piece of work from Seifollah Daad features meticulous attention to period detail and moving performances.","popularity":0.3017,"poster_path":"/1o70NqzU4VQ41RlEe8x1LOfnR12.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sina
