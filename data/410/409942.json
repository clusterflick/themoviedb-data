A man who has had to live several exiles and has received all the awards that this world can give. But above all, the affection of an unconditional, massive and faithful audience that follows him everywhere and pampers him every day with their applause and reading. A sad childhood, a youth full of work and reading, and a maturity full of commitments marked Benedetti. His work testifies the history, that which only artists can tell.","popularity":0.1998,"poster_path":"/fzosoYndARyl8K3sAwjazCMlmLc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gauzú Media","origin_country":""},{"id":12955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zip Films","origin_country":""},{"id":158585,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV de Catalunya","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2004-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Words of Truth","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":300828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mario Benedetti","original_name":"Mario Benedetti","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/1Vp6zFnIRZnKMtj4yalrX6dswj2.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610c7c0bdcf8750080df30f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54566,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Saramago","original_name":"José Saramago","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":"/8dasmjnUVBk5xywcZspbk8FiStP.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610c7c1768b1ea002b7902d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Ángel Solá","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Solá","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/jvkbzIBASI8H91kuN0z9bnLuQuB.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610c7c264cbe120062ee5c05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3171765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idea Vilariño","original_name":"Idea Vilariño","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/vlcHn1Hm33sQvIsGdPg4XhMwmo9.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610c7c32323eba002fbd4c89","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuel Vázquez Montalbán","original_name":"Manuel Vázquez Montalbán","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/8PD0QsrU2gDYlTwFpAY6fJHg6rZ.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610c7c3e68b1ea007fd807a7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Casas","original_name":"Ricardo Casas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61021d7022931a005c4af37b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1852588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eduardo Martín","original_name":"Eduardo Martín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610c7b0ab234b9005ed04abd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2332689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yvonne Ruocco","original_name":"Yvonne Ruocco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610c7a05ee43e80027d1088b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181070,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Rodríguez","original_name":"Daniel Rodríguez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610c7a53b234b900462859d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"José Mendieta","original_name":"José Mendieta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610c7b007719d7002ca5d52c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3187875,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Licio M.
