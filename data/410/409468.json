At first they wear highly stylised, predominantly white costumes before switching to all-white leotards and coloured cellophane headdresses with matching extensions on each of their fingers. The dancers form complex compositions comparable to abstract paintings and hold their poses in tableaux. At other points they explore parts of the moving scenography.","popularity":0.1072,"poster_path":"/aTg3HYRJsRbyzrqoJITSZQWksDz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
