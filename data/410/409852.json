Having returned to reality from an inner voyage to death and back in a comaâ€“like state he finds himself abandoned in a cold and unforgiving world devoid of purpose. As memories of his lover slowly reform and solidify in his mind he sets out on a journey to rediscover the distant and immediately recent events that lead to his hospitalization. Told through the lucid perception of the protagonist, Inanimate explores the fractured psyche of a man grappling with the horror of uncertainty and ultimately asks how you could choose to live where there is nothing to live for.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inanimate","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George-Alex Nagle","original_name":"George-Alex Nagle","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8921e9251410daa009b80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4463766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
