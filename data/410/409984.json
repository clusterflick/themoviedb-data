Struggling to understand this incongruous request and balking at betraying his mother, David is evasive, then hesitates. He's never had the affectionate sharing and complicity that he'd hoped for with his father ; what if this request were the opportunity to strike up the father/son dialog that is so badly missing ? David goes on a stroll with Robert and the two men soon find themselves searching for prostitute for the elderly man.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La promenade","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina de Van","original_name":"Marina de Van","popularity":0.1608,"profile_path":"/nbH2syFPE7LCW9HQiNWNrFxb5Yf.jpg","credit_id":"57b8984b9251416174001787","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1064897","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
