Director Ali Zhekan paints a stark picture of poverty and patriarchy in rural Iran (the mother stores her rice in a container hidden in a tree; her brother, who brokered the wedding, mercilessly beats the recalcitrant child), but this 1986 film is distinguished mostly by Taslimi's increasingly fiery performance as the mother decides to defend her daughter's freedom.","popularity":0.1355,"poster_path":"/hUDEVBI6keZZvDcWUZUxMeT8KpI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mare","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Taslimi","original_name":"Susan Taslimi","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/2HGM6ScXRC2utP5b7vh4ZdZnEf6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rezvaneh","credit_id":"591ce5e0c3a36878fe011a69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hossein Mahjoub","original_name":"حسین محجوب","popularity":0.285,"profile_path":"/l4jLGqcLJePC9gHIEd0KlSsnPw1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rahmat","credit_id":"591ce5e59251414a7b012dcc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Firouz Behjat-Mohamadi","original_name":"Firouz Behjat-Mohamadi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ghodrat","credit_id":"591ce5eac3a368774e013abd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ataollah Zahed","original_name":"Ataollah Zahed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nooragha","credit_id":"62677a072b113d0067611a48","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farhad Khanmohammadi","original_name":"Farhad Khanmohammadi","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Aghbay","credit_id":"62677a111f98d10050b44e90","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1666120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maliheh Nazari","original_name":"Maliheh Nazari","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Halimeh","credit_id":"62677a195ab81a0068f35f8f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3523633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mojilong Danespooy","original_name":"Mojilong Danespooy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Golbooteh","credit_id":"62677a2319675700519dff6e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3523634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parvin Hazrati","original_name":"Parvin Hazrati","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Robabeh","credit_id":"62677a2e158c85005063c424","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parviz Shahinkhou","original_name":"Parviz Shahinkhou","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/mWc0XqrqZ9vFScP5yptiIhrXo2e.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bagher","credit_id":"62677a3a2b113d0067611b2a","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118657,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Firooz Malekzadeh","original_name":"Firooz Malekzadeh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626779e33876510167dff409","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Zhekan","original_name":"Ali Zhekan","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626779d5ce6c4c005067926a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3523630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sharif Lotfi","original_name":"Sharif Lotfi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626779dcd954200099dadcd6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Zhekan","original_name":"Ali Zhekan","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b885c192514161c7000a8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0123160","wikidata_id":"Q14756542","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hUDEVBI6keZZvDcWUZUxMeT8KpI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qFDTc7ecC7tLxdv7rYlnfNCoHK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
