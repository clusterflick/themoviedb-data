The jailer wears a mask death's head mask and a nun's habit with a skull and crossbones on the front and God sits on an altar, flanked by angels, while the devil attempts to convict the woman for her sins. Shot with a handheld camera that doesn't always remain steady or keep the scene in frame, it is full of religious imagery and evocative folkloric elements, with flashbacks to the woman's life that provide a realism in sharp contrast to the allegorical pageantry. It shows its amateur origins, the texture, the pageantry, and the allegorical and ritualistic elements also looks forward to the American Underground cinema of Kenneth Anger, Curtis Harrington, and others in the 1950s and 1960s.","popularity":0.0528,"poster_path":"/zKvFeaznQes5iPj0gAxkl9KazF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdict: Not Guilty","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eloyce Gist","original_name":"Eloyce Gist","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/yfivM3hpm14aOMrHMQAdL5A2lxH.jpg","credit_id":"579ecaf9c3a36861e5001712","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eloyce Gist","original_name":"Eloyce Gist","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/yfivM3hpm14aOMrHMQAdL5A2lxH.jpg","credit_id":"579ecb05c3a3687ae3000ae2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Gist","original_name":"James Gist","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579ecae5c3a36879d3000d3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Gist","original_name":"James Gist","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579ecb13c3a3687a61000cf6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Gist","original_name":"James Gist","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579ecb20c3a36861e5001724","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eloyce Gist","original_name":"Eloyce Gist","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/yfivM3hpm14aOMrHMQAdL5A2lxH.jpg","credit_id":"579ecad2c3a36818320032e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0289601","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zKvFeaznQes5iPj0gAxkl9KazF0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Traveling Program","release_date":"1933-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
