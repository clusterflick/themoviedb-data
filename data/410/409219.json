Everything about Brasilia was devised and designed, but not on the basis of some cold urban design concept: the plan proves to originate from 19th-century priest Don Bosco’s dream. The chaos and disorder of the adjacent construction workers' village Vila Amauri long stood in stark contrast to the grandeur and majestic regularity of Brasilia. Now the village has disappeared beneath the reservoir’s surface, the necessary order has been restored. All Still Orbit examines both these histories.","popularity":0.0849,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73364,"logo_path":"/qWknICHaBx2WMaBZKE6w4BupY8F.png","name":"Dart Film & Video","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":83799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flvmina Creative Production","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":83800,"logo_path":"/qAIl2gCsGw3jnMbE6lGaHex7jie.png","name":"Restart","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2016-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Still Orbit","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Lattimer","original_name":"James Lattimer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579fcf70925141686f0003ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"579fcf60c3a36816eb0050e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Lattimer","original_name":"James Lattimer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583a64e4c3a3686354000e28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maja Kantar","original_name":"Maja Kantar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583a64cec3a368622c0011cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"583a64d7c3a3686354000e20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"5b4af54f9251417d2701ee0b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Lattimer","original_name":"James Lattimer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4af567c3a36823e3022bdd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Komljen","original_name":"Dane Komljen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/p6rkk9gfUwpj1jrge0vla89y1lE.jpg","credit_id":"5b4af5569251417d2701ee14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Lattimer","original_name":"James Lattimer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4af56f0e0a26453b020036","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5364778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
