Rithy Panh shows us the work done in Cambodia to connect Khmer-society to \"modern world\". Farmers, soldiers and children work for a living there and unearthen skulls and bones -their remains from PolPot-regime you can see. The fear in their mind is portrayed by Rithy Panh in this documentary. As the other work done by Rithy Panh this deals with his people. I like it very much! The movie was awarded 1999 at \"Visions du Réel\" in Nyon (Switzerland) and at \"Cinéma du Réel\" in Paris.","popularity":0.2552,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2000-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land of the Wandering Souls","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":129919,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabelle Roudy","original_name":"Isabelle Roudy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a3fe7d764b9900779f914f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rithy Panh","original_name":"Rithy Panh","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/fMfHlfQMTGbg17DfDR0WSyg9xOj.jpg","credit_id":"60a3fe62764b990029dd64b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129920,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Christine Rougerie","original_name":"Marie-Christine Rougerie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a3fe8b764b990040a183a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":129897,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cati Couteau","original_name":"Cati Couteau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a3fe6de24e3a00584883de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129918,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Prum Mésar","original_name":"Prum Mesa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a3fe75e24e3a00584883e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rithy Panh","original_name":"Rithy Panh","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/fMfHlfQMTGbg17DfDR0WSyg9xOj.jpg","credit_id":"57aabb63c3a36808210010d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0245500","wikidata_id":"Q3213120","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"km","note":"","release_date":"2000-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
