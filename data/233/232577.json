Edison envisaged combining the phonograph with motion pictures even before they had been perfected and there is a test sequence from 1895. By the time this 'phonoscene' had been made, Alice Guy had been directing a series of them and there was a series in production in Germany, too. Yet true synchronization remained a problem, what with records wearing out and film breaking until the perfection of sound on film itself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sHgwjJ7YUDdvNVD0HcQm8jVwIRD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société L.
