The film is a cruel parody on Danish producer Ole Olsen's \"Løvejagten\" (1907) which was at the time banned in Denmark (due to the fact that a lion and other animals were actually killed in the film) but shown in Sweden. In the student version two actors dressed up as a lion and a kangaroo get shot by hunters, but the hunters themselves soon get arrested by the police, an allusion to a recent conflict between the students and the local police.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/Al5LcA52c6aUq4nyzTHtB9IsVwk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248824,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.
