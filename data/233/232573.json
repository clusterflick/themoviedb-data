While famous as an actor – the eponymous hero in the BBC hit Jonathan Creek – and a household star for his role as Stephen Fry’s foil on QI, Alan was sorely missed from live stand-up. His first show back is a glorious insight into Alan’s unique worldview – growing up in the ‘70s, losing his mother as a little boy, the vagaries of Facebook, sex toys and being a father are just some of the subjects he tackles.","popularity":0.2282,"poster_path":"/pvBbstOGmKZmHVUytX2uQYUUpxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alan Davies: Life Is Pain","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Davies","original_name":"Alan Davies","popularity":0.7132,"profile_path":"/5eiXSaR1vW6mDYSr2Jcyf5h1xvg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"586dee1ec3a3683b64003b9d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Davies","original_name":"Alan Davies","popularity":0.7132,"profile_path":"/5eiXSaR1vW6mDYSr2Jcyf5h1xvg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e05c3a36847f8279c13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Cumming","original_name":"Michael Cumming","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":"/eK0frF3vjp3Ej4hbjpwu5QtSEg.jpg","credit_id":"586dedd592514129560035d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3552568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pvBbstOGmKZmHVUytX2uQYUUpxu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
