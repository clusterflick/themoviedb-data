The film is about Earth, about working with Earth, sacred to the indigenous people. An account of beauty that silences, of friendliness, also grief.” (Nestler)","popularity":0.0719,"poster_path":"/kVxmQc8rlogZ7n6jZKL0WdAJmu7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pachamama: Our Land","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Pachamama - Unsere Erde","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pachamama: Our Earth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e05c3a36847f8279925","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"59e70be59251413c2300a02a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"59e70bd7c3a3685157007f76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Komers","original_name":"Rainer Komers","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/4Ewheviq176Qvj5b92PUafM51tM.jpg","credit_id":"5f0f8e5f3bd26e00346b6d76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210213","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95ZBpy6iLowXlSzcpTZkA99lJ5c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":769},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kVxmQc8rlogZ7n6jZKL0WdAJmu7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
