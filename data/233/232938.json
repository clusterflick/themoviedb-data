Unable to agree, each goes to a sculptor's studio and bribes him to sculpt a bust of the individual favorite. Instead, the sculptor spends their fees on a dinner with his model during which he becomes so inebriated that he is taken to jail. There he has a nightmare, wherein three busts are created and animated from clay (through stop-motion photography) in the likenesses of Democrat William Jennings Bryan and Republicans Charles W. Fairbanks and William Howard Taft. Finally an animated bust of Roosevelt appears.","popularity":0.3178,"poster_path":"/q26pCxxqYfgHijXXUBJqTbfheZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sculptor's Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Auer","original_name":"Florence Auer","popularity":0.1698,"profile_path":"/82nUuX7cDdfFxfZ2bIC063Hmt2Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Model","credit_id":"52fe4e0dc3a36847f827b37f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dillon","original_name":"Edward Dillon","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/lRWa2M2guVQUo4GCMPComWsds79.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e0dc3a36847f827b383","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
