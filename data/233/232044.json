He speaks about his beginnings, his moving to Paris for two years of intensive study with Nadia Boulanger, his meeting with Indian musician Ravi Shankar and director Robert Wilson, who had a deep influence on his career. The film also shows him at work on the last details of his opera The Sound of a Voice, directed by Robert Woodruff and conducted by Alan Johnson.  Éric Darmon's camera, with its poetic shots and original framings, takes us for a musical journey into seven months of the life of the composer who, rising from the underground scene of the seventies, brought on a revolution in modern theater.","popularity":0.3547,"poster_path":"/w3iqInhvC3zW9X40TEs0Cx9CHcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mémoire Magnétique","origin_country":""},{"id":92125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Streams agnès b.
