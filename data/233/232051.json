Starring the members of the laser metal trio Nightsatan and set in the year 2034, the film is a nod to the 1980s exploitation and scifi movie aesthetics – especially the classics of the Italian post apocalypse genre – with a hint of influences from Sergio Leone and Alejandro Jodorowsky. The soundtrack features material from the next studio album of Nightsatan, due out in 2014.","popularity":0.2059,"poster_path":"/d2USXjn7gYI0JDkpkbugBFZrcXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One band.
