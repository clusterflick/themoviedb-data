Overcome parallels this story. Set in modern day, a young man in high school mistreats anyone good around him, until he has a fateful accident which changes his life. Now he must make amends to all those around him, and try to become the person he knew he should have been the whole time.\r Thatâ€™s right: Overcome (Turn Around 2007) has a twin! All they had to do was change some of the evangelical themes to Mormon themes. But also for some bizarre reason, they changed all the names of the cast members, even though they are the same people. Apparently they thought that by changing the names, you would never know this was the same movie.","popularity":0.6183,"poster_path":"/ivtvi4AmcMMfANzYIEgZLpSYERi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26589,"logo_path":null,"name":"WisenQuest","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you turn your life around?","title":"Overcome","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Turn Around","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1193696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaci Twiss","original_name":"Jaci Twiss","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/gFPKo3SwW1jUg0Avz69Y804zOHK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sara Taylor (Jaycee Lynn)","credit_id":"6741bb054b15b8ae31b0181a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordon Sorenson","original_name":"Jordon Sorenson","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/jrjK0GYpBwxvR2GMjQXvD8ywZ72.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Colton Pratt (Aaron U.
