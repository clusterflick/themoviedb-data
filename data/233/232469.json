The film is about an idea as well as a man - the idea of free expression as the defining characteristic of the individual. Hentoff is a pioneering journalist who raised jazz as an art form and was present at the creation of 'alternative' journalism. 'Pleasures' wraps the themes of liberty and identity around a historical narrative that stretches from the Great Depression to the Patriot Act. With a mix of interviews, archival footage and music, it employs a complex non-linear structure to engage the audience in a life of independent ideas and the creation of an enduring voice.","popularity":0.0997,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pleasures of Being/  Out of Step: Notes on the Life of/ Nat Hentoff","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Hentoff","original_name":"Nat Hentoff","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/gXsE7xf792cM7T10SigJhpfwa4g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"66bbd746fbf6463a57663c62","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David L.
