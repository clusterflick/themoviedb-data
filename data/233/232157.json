One morning, a cyclone hits his village and Dorothy has no time to take refuge in the family shelter. The cyclone takes it with the house to a faraway land, an unreal world populated by extraordinary characters. As soon as she arrives, she has only one idea in mind, to go home to find her aunt. How do I do that? No one has the power to help her get home. No one except perhaps a strange and fantastic character who has lived for years in the Emerald City, the Wizard of Oz.","popularity":0.2212,"poster_path":"/iz6x1ZZgPd2McChzvuXaqCBYX2V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":356,"logo_path":"/9tW5wZEGotn1Ei5pErA88m47XiD.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1267410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Facundo","original_name":"Marie Facundo","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/eLE0ZhNPySr97Qm84THo9DSO4Qw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dothy","credit_id":"52fe4dfec3a36847f8278593","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Sual","original_name":"Pascal Sual","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lion","credit_id":"52fe4dfec3a36847f8278597","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Alexis","original_name":"David Alexis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Magicien d’ Oz / L’inventeur","credit_id":"5f93ce072fccee0040b03e55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Deimas","original_name":"Sophie Deimas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"La Sorcière","credit_id":"5f93cf503ff2df0042adfa8f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Jarny","original_name":"Stéphane Jarny","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d2473ff2df0033ae02b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Jarny","original_name":"Stéphane Jarny","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d27307291c0043f229b9","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":572481,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dove Attia","original_name":"Dove Attia","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d3567dfda60061044bb6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":540731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Albert Cohen","original_name":"Albert Cohen","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d4956e0d720031fe778f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Charles Mathey","original_name":"Jean-Charles Mathey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d4f96e0d72004cfe7928","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruno Berberes","original_name":"Bruno Berberes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d5bc07291c0060f2302c","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828065,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Philippe Bonichon","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Bonichon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f93d7a71bf266004203fb29","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
