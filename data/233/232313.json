What politicians didn’t count on was the forceful response from women of Virginia, or the hundreds who gathered on the steps of the state capitol to protest the bill. Empowered and emboldened to express their beliefs and fight for their rights, Virginian women are heard loud and clear in this powerful documentary.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Political Bodies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2971992","wikidata_id":"Q127688719","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
