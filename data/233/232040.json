The children’s grandfather, who was known for his tyranny, reluctantly agrees to shelter the grieving family, and tries to force his daughter to marry again. The magic of the city of Damascus takes over the conscience. Dib, whose main concern has become discovering all the secrets of this city, is driven by his heart full of dreams, but he sees nothing in his life except humiliation and cruelty. The fragrance of childhood dies in Dib's heart, as he grows up in light of the political fluctuations that prevailed in the fifties (the end of the military dictatorship in Syria at that time, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, Nasser’s rise to power in Cairo, and Egyptian-Syrian unity in 1958), so that his rosy childhood dreams were shattered on the rocks of cruelty and violence. The city's dreams turn into a nightmare..","popularity":0.3409,"poster_path":"/8HyioV4zYWlkPllTbuMIOPkyJmu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137023,"logo_path":null,"name":"المؤسسة العامة للسينما","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"1984-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams of the City","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","title":"Ahlam el Madina","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bassel Abiad","original_name":"Bassel Abiad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Dib","credit_id":"53cf8c630e0a265dea00936c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hicham Khchefati","original_name":"Hicham Khchefati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53cf8c6b0e0a265ded0093bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1335430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasmine Khlat","original_name":"Yasmine Khlat","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/2Og8zDdhbusTw8kD2Hndayw6K4S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53cf8c720e0a265df300955a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammad Malas","original_name":"Mohammad Malas","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/zdlJtebk2MU1ustdDx4zlQPiebx.jpg","credit_id":"53cf8c7f0e0a265de70094c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Zikra","original_name":"Samir Zikra","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kZn5l97wHgp35ZYMaUbJjfC8vOE.jpg","credit_id":"59bc3d339251411cc70004d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0134279","wikidata_id":"Q5306753","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Iu53aXvdOZI21QqQuQYPVoMJMK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.637,"height":785,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/8HyioV4zYWlkPllTbuMIOPkyJmu.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/yTAytSGnMOMCdBlcaPfIQP5XaGr.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1342,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/bj06SuYENPkaviymF02XOdgFNQH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":936},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1452,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/lxPSJX4U8yhyCaRNH9pL0zwbGRc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1024},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/jwFbt9tVRp81DUs0vb0RMCQwC6n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1334}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":191111,"name":"syria"},{"id":208611,"name":"1950s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
