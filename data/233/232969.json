Young Hansen is deeply in love with his boss’s daughter and regularly meets with her in secret. One day, the boss catches them and throws Hansen out on his ear. Hansen goes to the local bar to drown his sorrows. Here he meets a man who gives him some quite special cigars: their smoke seems to have a magical effect. Whenever he puffs smoke into someone’s face, they can be persuaded to do anything. Will his boss also prove susceptible to the magic of the mysterious cigar?  Only a fragment of the film survives. The beginning and end are missing. The rest of the plot can be read in the film’s programme.
