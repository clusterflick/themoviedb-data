As the band is probably never going to perform in this line-up again, \"Focul Viu\" is a must-have for every fan of Negura Bunget who didn't have a chance to witness the band live before their split. \"Focul Viu\" is available as DVD, 2CD, and as a box-set including both formats.","popularity":0.0484,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lupus Lounge","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Negură Bunget: Focul viu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Negură Bunget","original_name":"Negură Bunget","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"540ebea10e0a2641a3000c29","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
