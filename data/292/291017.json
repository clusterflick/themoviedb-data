Taking up the anti-television fight he initiated with \"Pas vu Pas pris\", his first film, he confronts the people responsible for the news who have always avoided tackling this taboo subject. But the investigation does not go as planned : the old dinosaurs and young guardians now how to handle this media critic. To find his \"fighting spirit\" again, Carles calls to arms his friends and changes methods : Henceforth, no more concessions !","popularity":1.4679,"poster_path":"/fKr1q6N1tDnDRtvOcNdXD32UAEC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fin de concession","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Carles","original_name":"Pierre Carles","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/AdUohXvcWns0dJC0ykPBmnlHCpD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Pierre Carles","credit_id":"540bf792c3a36879ae002e16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Carles","original_name":"Pierre Carles","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/AdUohXvcWns0dJC0ykPBmnlHCpD.jpg","credit_id":"540bf7a4c3a36879ab002f6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1653855","wikidata_id":"Q3072304","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fKr1q6N1tDnDRtvOcNdXD32UAEC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lp6T7Ka3l4NLcD7cQ1moFW3h1EL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":6007,"name":"media"},{"id":156273,"name":"critic"},{"id":168643,"name":"tv production"},{"id":176794,"name":"public media"},{"id":195240,"name":"investigative journalism"},{"id":209794,"name":"corporate media"},{"id":214499,"name":"television / tv studio"},{"id":227426,"name":"media criticism"},{"id":232568,"name":"media & politics"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":282418,"name":"french politics"},{"id":318563,"name":"tv station"},{"id":321302,"name":"media analysis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
