He can recite any Shakespeare sonnet and is facile with accents, but he can't land an agent or a job. During the course of one summing-it-all-up day, he drives his cab around the city dealing with fare evaders, an insolent stage manager determined to keep him from auditioning for his choice director, his estranged wife who has a new lover, his mistress who seems awfully close to her \"drawing teacher\", and two teenage sons whose bright visions of the future don't seem to include jobs. If he can only cope with all the annoyances of this day, maybe he can deal with the limitations in his abilities and his future.","popularity":2.0146,"poster_path":"/9OtZZHtbVMGlnXMmpugWPeSSblu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95947,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Film Distribution Company (UFDC)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flanagan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Walls of Glass","type":"Re-release (VHS)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Page","original_name":"Geraldine Page","popularity":0.6782,"profile_path":"/oBQTdTuGwc88tV32V0bbzAiLwhi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mama","credit_id":"5c619cdcc3a3684fa4d64eaf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Bosco","original_name":"Philip Bosco","popularity":0.5205,"profile_path":"/fhN45vRvNiHr1lqx5tjdQULHcKU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"James Flanagan","credit_id":"5c619ce59251412fbcfacc1f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bloom","original_name":"Brian Bloom","popularity":0.9474,"profile_path":"/9mZKhI3aVbzZ5Xq43n7fGzWAqi0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Danny","credit_id":"5c619cfd9251412fc4faeca5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Weber","original_name":"Steven Weber","popularity":1.2329,"profile_path":"/8FtkapenCOpe39eE1sQus5WLWAq.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Sean","credit_id":"5c61a3709251412faefaf518","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olympia Dukakis","original_name":"Olympia Dukakis","popularity":0.6492,"profile_path":"/pwoIzB9QSjKkWORQ7SpetnxFizf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5c619d04c3a3684fa8d61287","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Thorson","original_name":"Linda Thorson","popularity":0.6636,"profile_path":"/kim1tySTD91Iz0ZM5Bi7baO1qA2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Andrea","credit_id":"5c619d0f925141250afa7f7f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Tolkan","original_name":"James Tolkan","popularity":0.8664,"profile_path":"/euEktcyVXm1pq5UBC16v3zuBq7J.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Turner","credit_id":"5c619fa19251412fbcfacf0f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Zorich","original_name":"Louis Zorich","popularity":0.2369,"profile_path":"/tDpQOZ5KcNS3wOaG8I3TVhoNdqK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lerner","credit_id":"5c619d40c3a368745ed5c0a6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Epstein","original_name":"Pierre Epstein","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/oTFfbJdoZXHBJZYZteNnJAQGFkL.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Morry","credit_id":"5c619fccc3a3684fa8d61646","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Hickey","original_name":"Bill Hickey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Papa","credit_id":"5c619d4c9251412fb4faeea8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theron Montgomery","original_name":"Theron Montgomery","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pickles","credit_id":"5c619d18c3a3684fabd61008","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Yamamoto","original_name":"Ronald Yamamoto","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Sushi","credit_id":"5c619d5a9251412faefae978","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cory Notrica","original_name":"Cory Notrica","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Gordon","credit_id":"5c619d6fc3a3684f90d6285f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Thigpen","original_name":"Lynne Thigpen","popularity":0.4581,"profile_path":"/wCMTGuJk6kxEmElNT56HpsL3GJO.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Woman Cop","credit_id":"5c619d900e0a267de696434f","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":196311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwyllum Evans","original_name":"Gwyllum Evans","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Church","credit_id":"5c619fb79251412fbcfacf15","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.R.
