The film also examines the media storm that threatens the team's Olympic dreams when one of its members suffers devastating injuries and faces manslaughter charges as a result of a tragic car accident. Juxtaposing scenes that are intense and emotional, uplifting and mesmerizing, quirky and entertaining, Sync or Swim is the first-ever behind the scenes documentary about the making of the U.S. Olympic Synchronized Swimming Team.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/fDBx7jLL0XU1RfBNnwsDF2hNjCD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sync or Swim","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheryl Furjanic","original_name":"Cheryl Furjanic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590b5c40c3a36869ea000a40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0496403","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fDBx7jLL0XU1RfBNnwsDF2hNjCD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":701}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
