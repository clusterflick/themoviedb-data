The combination of an ageing population of fanciers and a lack of young blood coming into the sport left the future of pigeon racing looking bleak. The image of flat-capped men in sheds covered in pigeon poo needed a make-over.  In an effort to sex-up a dying pursuit, a new style of race known as \"one loft\" racing has emerged. These races allow top pigeon fanciers from around the world to compete in the same event for big cash prizes - and the biggest contest of them all is the Million Dollar Pigeon Race in South Africa.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Million Dollar Pigeon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1024223","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
