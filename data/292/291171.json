At 78 feet in height, the famous East Window at York Minster is the largest medieval stained-glass window in the country and it was the creative vision of a single artist - a mysterious master craftsman called John Thornton, one of the earliest named English artists.  The East Window of York Minster is far more than a work of artistic genius, it is a window onto the medieval world and the medieval mind - telling us who were once were and who we still are, all preserved in the most fragile medium of all.","popularity":0.0797,"poster_path":"/tfjbnQTwtjuGI0WD66KDsVV2tQ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain's Most Fragile Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Ramirez","original_name":"Janina Ramirez","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/rykuMTefLLKsg8JssYwhBFeqpFX.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"5b9aa335925141425f002bf1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3139533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Ayers","original_name":"Tim Ayers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self -
