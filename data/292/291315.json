A naked woman, dead from a botched illegal abortion, lying on a motel room floor. The picture appeared in Ms. Magazine in April 1973, and quickly became a symbol for the abortion rights movement. LEONA'S SISTER GERRI tells the dramatic story of Gerri Santoro, a mother of two and the \"real person\" in the now famous photo. Should the media have used this image? What circumstances led to Gerri's tragic death? Powerfully addressing issues of reproductive rights and domestic violence, this video is a moving portrait of Gerri Santoro's life and society's response to her death.","popularity":0.2468,"poster_path":"/2Zq5kdhfiJEbTctGOhGwefQvdgr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leona's Sister Gerri","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1168263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gillooly","original_name":"Jane Gillooly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614ac8c89a9f9a006028e8fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4481872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"C.L.
