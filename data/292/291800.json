Charlie gets word that a rich uncle has died, leaving him millions. Attorneys advise him to repair to a resort and avoid gold diggers. Once there, word spreads among the single women, and several try to ensnare him. At first he's gullible, then he cottons on, so when Thelma, a wealthy young woman, mistakes him for a fortune hunter, he dismisses her as well. A manager's error puts Charlie and Thelma in the same suite, and both think the other is prospecting. A dressing gown, radio, bare feet, pistol, keyhole, fountain pen, bedcovers, and a suspicious hotel detective join the mix-up. But wait, was the inheritance a mistake?","popularity":0.5078,"poster_path":"/8X15xKtPS1MVxv2FVqoLVMx0MhJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dollar Dizzy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Charley Chase","credit_id":"541012970e0a2612550013bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Todd","original_name":"Thelma Todd","popularity":0.2588,"profile_path":"/pXImIsfL2n0AXFB5fPWj3nb7fKK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Thelma Todd","credit_id":"541012ba0e0a261251001431","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":145713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Carr","original_name":"Lorena Carr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gold-Digger (uncredited)","credit_id":"541012cc0e0a26124e001441","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Mae Crane","original_name":"Betty Mae Crane","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Spoken Introductory Titles (uncredited)","credit_id":"5410130a0e0a26125f0013e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Crane","original_name":"Beverly Crane","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Spoken Introductory Titles (uncredited)","credit_id":"5410131e0e0a2612550013d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Dix","original_name":"Dorothy Dix","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/rMEzc9VlMq1GTv7oARlRgQ4jCaw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gold-Digger (uncredited)","credit_id":"541013320e0a26125100143e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Finlayson","original_name":"James Finlayson","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":"/mKzmqNW32JgFYICiQfEFK5m8b8s.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"House Detective","credit_id":"541013480e0a26125f0013e8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Granger","original_name":"Dick Granger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"One of the Quimbys (uncredited)","credit_id":"5410135b0e0a26126700141e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Woman Who Drops Her Pearls (uncredited)","credit_id":"5410136e0e0a261267001423","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hall","original_name":"Charlie Hall","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/huLPhEhh8pO9v0gSJb7HVB76GRZ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bellhop","credit_id":"541013910e0a261251001448","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Quimby the Lawyer","credit_id":"541013b30e0a261259001448","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Lewis","original_name":"Ann Lewis","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Gold-Digger (uncredited)","credit_id":"541013ed0e0a26124e001454","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Shoemaker","original_name":"Ida Shoemaker","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Chase, Charley's Mother (uncredited)","credit_id":"541014110e0a261264001405","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Stroback","original_name":"Ted Stroback","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Hotel Manager (uncredited)","credit_id":"541014680e0a26125f001401","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James W.
