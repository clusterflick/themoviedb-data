He proposed based on his observations, that the only way for the towers to fall the way they did was the use of explosives in a controlled demolition. His theory conflicts with official reports which concluded the towers fell from impact damage and fires caused by the hijacked planes. This created a firestorm within the community and even reached nation media attention. Steven Jones received hate mail, threats, and even bribery to stop his research. What started as a mere Hypothesis became so much more.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hypothesis","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"hy.poth.e.sis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven E.
