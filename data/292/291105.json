How would nature react - and how swiftly? On the edge of Europe, the deserted village of Chernobyl reveals the surprising answer after an unplanned experiment. Chernobyl was abandoned by people after the worst nuclear disaster in history (April 26, 1986). A level 7 meltdown resulted in a severe release of radioactivity following a massive explosion that destroyed the reactor. More than 20 years later, Chernobyl has been taken over by a remarkable collection of wildlife and descendents of pets that were left in the city when its residents fled the nuclear fallout. Unexpectedly in the aftermath of this disaster, Chernobyl has become a sanctuary for plants, birds, and animals, including some species thought to be on the brink of extinction.","popularity":0.3924,"poster_path":"/1xxFunORPxjNkwWzmPEubSbtRpS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chernobyl Reclaimed: An Animal Takeover","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Chernobyl Reclaimed","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3116552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hayden","original_name":"Peter Hayden","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b398c2e0ec51005186454c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315076,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thassilo Franke","original_name":"Thassilo Franke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b3992154f6eb0062ff124d","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1832311","wikidata_id":"Q2720738","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9X1JM96FavsuYmSemxwhQxLY0RL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1xxFunORPxjNkwWzmPEubSbtRpS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":977,"name":"cat"},{"id":9741,"name":"radioactivity"},{"id":210326,"name":"chernobyl"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
