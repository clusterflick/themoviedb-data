He was also well known for his philanthropy; Newman's Own has given more than four hundred and thirty million dollars to charities around the world. Yet few know the gasoline-fueled passion that became so important in this complex, multifaceted man's makeup. Newman’s deep-seated passion for racing was so intense it nearly sidelined his acting career. His racing career spanned thirty-five years; Newman won four national championships as a driver and eight championships as an owner. Not bad for a guy who didn't even start racing until he was forty-seven years old.","popularity":2.1717,"poster_path":"/hsTxEODkmcHvVhR9junDH8I43dt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mollette","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
