Bobby Joe finds a renewed love in Jenny Jenkins, his childhood sweetheart, whose father is the town reverend and who believes that Bobby Joe has returned as a corrupt and demoralized person. Jenny's father jealously wants no connections between Bobby and Jenny, and takes measures to keep Bobby Joe from attending any of the Homecoming activities by persuading some local boys to beat him up. This builds to a crashing climax which is utterly shocking and unexpected.","popularity":0.5269,"poster_path":"/fsKma9nvE7mP03Q8ATTWmddyr0j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Windsplitter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim McMullan","original_name":"Jim McMullan","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/ySSDNXhh5xpXbfpYDibBkjWPH5s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bobby Joe","credit_id":"60f655ecaf58cb005e51d691","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Lambert","original_name":"Paul Lambert","popularity":0.6823,"profile_path":"/9hME9blSiEFNylgWa3YorFMAixx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Reverend","credit_id":"60f655fa7b7b4d007356b364","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Taylor","original_name":"Joyce Taylor","popularity":0.2579,"profile_path":"/4cgtov3xbTLty42jU7XEYwgdCEI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jenny Jenkins","credit_id":"60f65607209f18007d52c55e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobe Hooper","original_name":"Tobe Hooper","popularity":0.4893,"profile_path":"/rE5TqnAvgaKjWwWZ9AsoU9KcUGU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joby","credit_id":"60f65618af58cb005e51d72d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Siedow","original_name":"Jim Siedow","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/1VyuXh0j36fDAz9E1oLYJiA8JkL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Smith (Bobby Joe's Father)","credit_id":"67d216bbeedb53e52c1dd3b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bootsy Faggard","original_name":"Bootsy Faggard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67d217452575f01b3a6079a6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142279,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.D.
