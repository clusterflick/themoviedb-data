He survived this terrifying experience of torture and humiliation, and after the war he married, had three children, and tried to live a normal life. In 1982, however, he came to terms with his past and his true nature and decided to publicly reveal what he and thousands of other homosexuals branded with the Pink Triangle had undergone during the Nazi regime. Il Rosa Nudo (Naked Rose), inspired by the true story of Pierre Seel, depicts in a theatrical and evocative way the Homocaust, focusing on the scientific theories of SS Physician Carl Peter Værnet for the treatment of homosexuality, which paved the way for the Nazi persecution of gay men.","popularity":0.1818,"poster_path":"/zFQwOskttaojDvvl5i1fKdaPv25.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32577,"logo_path":null,"name":"V-Art Festival","origin_country":""},{"id":32579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Labor Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":32570,"logo_path":null,"name":"ReindeerCatSolutions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"There came a moment when I realized that liberation, the true one, was for the others\" - Pierre Seel","title":"Naked Rose","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il Rosa Nudo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Detori","original_name":"Gianni Detori","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"540e70690e0a2641960006a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Italo Medda","original_name":"Italo Medda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"540e70770e0a2641930006f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Anrò","original_name":"Sergio Anrò","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"540e70830e0a26419900066f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Loi","original_name":"Gianni Loi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"540e708e0e0a2641960006a9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Ottonello","original_name":"Francesco Ottonello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"540e70a00e0a2641960006b0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362238,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Irma Toudjian","original_name":"Irma Toudjian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540e6fd10e0a2641a0000640","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Coda","original_name":"Giovanni Coda","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kAGxktZwEUSor8ustGRsgKY2wJA.jpg","credit_id":"540e6f720e0a264199000657","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362237,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Les Sticks Fluo","original_name":"Les Sticks Fluo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540e6fb80e0a264196000694","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Coda","original_name":"Giovanni Coda","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kAGxktZwEUSor8ustGRsgKY2wJA.jpg","credit_id":"540e6f600e0a26419d0005e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362239,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrea Lotta","original_name":"Andrea Lotta","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540e6fe50e0a2641a3000679","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2872380","wikidata_id":"Q13526932","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":914,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/zFQwOskttaojDvvl5i1fKdaPv25.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1013,"name":"homophobia"},{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":191726,"name":"nazism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Il Rosa Nudo - Official Teaser 2014 -","key":"0jbYIJykIeY","published_at":"2014-04-24T07:51:00.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"540e721b0e0a2641a30006b0"}]}}}
