Thousands of people are affected by suicide yearly. Once I Dreamt of Life is a feature length documentary film about suicide. It’s an account about one’s personal relation to suicide, but also studies suicide as social phenomena: The motives, warning signs &amp; consequences.  The film follows the journey of a young man, an animated character based on a real person, on his path towards suicide. The journey is described by people who’ve had encounters with suicide – parents who lost their child, young adults who considered or even tried committing suicide.  When linked together, these experiences offer a collage of our perception of suicide. They tell about how people cope with the past and find a reason to go on with their lives. The intention is not to romanticize suicide or judge. It encourages people to talk about painful and difficult experiences and reminds us how important it is to be heard.","popularity":0.084,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2014-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once I Dreamt Of Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Once I Dreamt Of Life","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sini Liimatainen","original_name":"Sini Liimatainen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540ed09e0e0a264196000f17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magnus Gertten","original_name":"Magnus Gertten","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/iRQk9IrWWYXBzqjL34bhm3eFzU1.jpg","credit_id":"636b63220499f2007fea8b70","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magnus Gertten","original_name":"Magnus Gertten","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/iRQk9IrWWYXBzqjL34bhm3eFzU1.jpg","credit_id":"636b632c21621b00cd6116e0","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076269,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"J-P Passi","original_name":"J-P Passi","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/onqLlpKOu6JirTzd240GK4mxCAj.jpg","credit_id":"58ba3f1dc3a36866af0148b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374477,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Conny Malmqvist","original_name":"Conny Malmqvist","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ba3f2ac3a36866860135f2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jukka Kärkkäinen","original_name":"Jukka Kärkkäinen","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/8OxEVkQXG7v7a4ba1bafuQ37L0A.jpg","credit_id":"5eeb09d2dd926a0034a25912","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2862392","wikidata_id":"Q107293418","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":894,"name":"depression"},{"id":236,"name":"suicide"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
