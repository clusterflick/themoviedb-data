It has some good points, including the complete abandonment of the sort of surrealistic stage design that had enlivened the silent cinema. Instead, this tries for a purely cinematic technique, including multiple exposures, undercranking and distorting camera angles and lenses.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/xGWrjsUf8bYnm21qxU1GS5I9hzF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1931-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Song of Life","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aribert Mog","original_name":"Aribert Mog","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Igor","credit_id":"541185230e0a26664300177d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Ferra","original_name":"Margot Ferra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Erika Walter","credit_id":"5411852d0e0a26663b00174c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Wagner","original_name":"Elsa Wagner","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/f8ELn1caKeFZjxaGS3VAK2M4pA1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Erikas Mutter","credit_id":"541185380e0a2666370016d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Busch","original_name":"Ernst Busch","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/cBvLvT1OpWYERA93nsmeK0nUQcZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sänger","credit_id":"541185420e0a26663b001752","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Monosson","original_name":"Leo Monosson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/hVOx8ggQN4p4e7e6YeJ5hXIdYMb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sänger","credit_id":"5411854c0e0a2666370016d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Paulsen","original_name":"Harald Paulsen","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/m7JkKrut1Z1VnZTcuuJQcf6a1rI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sänger","credit_id":"541185560e0a2666370016d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Keller","original_name":"Greta Keller","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sängerin","credit_id":"541185610e0a2666460016a6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Granowsky","original_name":"Alexis Granowsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541184e50e0a26664b001751","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025390","wikidata_id":"Q7765237","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGWrjsUf8bYnm21qxU1GS5I9hzF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
