The footage and the audio were recorded in a single day on June 17th, 2013 on location in Auschwitz-Birkenau with post-production being completed within 72 hours. Surbhi Goel, a professor of cultural studies from India on her first trip outside of her homeland, recorded extemporaneous impressions as she walked the grounds of the death camp with the filmmakers. These were later used as the voice-over narration. The project serves as the template in which future Markerists film essays will be produced--shot and recorded on location and completed immediately afterwards, staying relevant in this age of instant global communication.","popularity":0.2223,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Most 72","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Surbhi Goel","original_name":"Surbhi Goel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"540fd063c3a3685ebc000c3a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Morgan","original_name":"Tobias Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fd010c3a3685eb8000cbc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Surbhi Goel","original_name":"Surbhi Goel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcfe9c3a3685ebc000c23","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Morgan","original_name":"Tobias Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fd008c3a3685eb1000c2e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Morgan","original_name":"Tobias Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fd001c3a3685eb8000cb9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blue Un Sok Kim","original_name":"Blue Un Sok Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcfc8c3a3685ea5000c6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Morgan","original_name":"Tobias Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcfbbc3a3685ea5000c68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Wittek","original_name":"Anna Wittek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcfd4c3a3685eb8000cad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Wittek","original_name":"Anna Wittek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fd01cc3a3685ea1000d18","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Wittek","original_name":"Anna Wittek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fd02fc3a3685ebc000c31","department":"Production","job":"Location Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362635,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Wittek","original_name":"Anna Wittek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcff6c3a3685ea1000d0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3019698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1631,"name":"concentration camp"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
