At any rate Martin, who is indifferent to pets in general, isn't doing all too well in his marketing job at Floppy Dog Foods. But right now this is the least of his problems: he has made a British au-pair pregnant in a one night stand; and while he is trying to figure out how to deal with this, his ex-wife (who divorced him over his not wanting children) and his mother (a militant anti-overpopulation, pro-birth control, pro-abortion activist) have a few comments to offer on the situation. Before his own child is born, Martin clearly has some growing up of his own to do.","popularity":0.7759,"poster_path":"/ovXe2hcXVhw0skxa9h6GTWwSzRA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bloody Mary
