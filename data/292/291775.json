It was made in Chile, using many poetic elements of the country. Chile is seen through the eyes of a Chinese painter—a painter who uses the traditional 18th-century concepts of Shih-Tao. Once again, I am doing something that, apparently, is not meant to go hand in hand.\r The landscape of my country, southern Chile, where I was born, initially provokes in me a feeling of fear. The landscape is madness. In these crazy landscapes, you can find very reasonable people, which makes the landscape seem even crazier.\"","popularity":0.3545,"poster_path":"/a0trqs8KMhXignxgG6JtdCGCcdu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Solitudes","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"540fc2d1c3a3685eb1000ad9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Badin","original_name":"Jean Badin","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/8RQFic73BKbYSWPMqtLrZce0iVM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"540fc2d9c3a3685eb1000adc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120713,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramón F.
