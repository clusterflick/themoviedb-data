Clarke, whose face - taken from a BBC archive dating back to the 1960s - appears in the distance. His features quickly dematerialize into a multitude of shimmering pixels, creating an enveloping and immersive space out of which the thoughts of the famed author of «2001: A Space Odyssey» emerge. At the heart of this spectral environment, and with a magnetic voice sending us back to the time of cathode ray tubes and the golden age of television broadcasting, A C. Clarke tells us about the arrival of digital revolution, decades ahead of his time. This film is an invitation to travel, and a crepuscular form of poetry to be experienced immersively.","popularity":0.1511,"poster_path":"/hl6VnpxlHVPw5aEXS1IXC5aS7Ew.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Da Prod","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Saw the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Odyseja przyszlosci","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Είδα το μέλλον","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"I Saw the Future","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":241,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur C.
