Rizzi spent seven weeks observing her and other women's daily life, which is devoid of any prospects. He shows how Alhlwani makes every effort to establish some kind of normality for her family despite the difficult camp conditions. The film vividlyconveys the cruelty of war, and especially the state o funcertainty and rootlessness to which refugees are exposed.  The film is the first part of a trilogy that focuses on the emergence of a new civil consciousness in Malaysia, Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain and Syria, as well as the social implications of the end of post-colonialism in these countries.","popularity":0.1313,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2013-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Waiting","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Waiting","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Warten","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4399546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekhlas Alhlwani","original_name":"Ekhlas Alhlwani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"herself","credit_id":"656496308f26bc00c59e1e0c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Rizzi","original_name":"Mario Rizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65649641706e560138c4af21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Rizzi","original_name":"Mario Rizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65649897b234b9013928bfc7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4399569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abed El Majeed El Naimi","original_name":"Abed El Majeed El Naimi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65649934edeb43011d5a2bb2","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4399566,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adriano Mestichella","original_name":"Adriano Mestichella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656498da3679a1097529ef1a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Rizzi","original_name":"Mario Rizzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656498e97dfda659304c6616","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2715004","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":973,"name":"refugee camp"},{"id":233536,"name":"syrian refugee"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
