In Seoul, he encounters a parallel society in which many queers hide and pretend to be heterosexual. The reason: Christian churches are gathering thousands of members around them in order to threaten the LGBTQ+ community. With their money and influence, they can steer politics. “Burning Blue“ portrays twelve people who stand up against these authorities. It is a battle against time, as they lose more and more members of their community to suicide. Yet dividing barriers keep growing bigger and bigger within their own circle. In a country that stigmatizes minorities and their mental health, the struggle for visibility pushes queer resistance to its limits. The film shines a spotlight on the abuse of power in the church and the growing transphobia in the LGBTQ+ community in South Korea. And it poses the question: Can there ever be a real safe space?","popularity":0.0632,"poster_path":"/mX9ASZ4WHOAZRXcIvNNtajCCsfc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4398191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ly Lam","original_name":"Kim Ly Lam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563a69f706e5600fe0403c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4398192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Luna Pohl","original_name":"Cecilia Luna Pohl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563a6a7a6c104011bde4f93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mX9ASZ4WHOAZRXcIvNNtajCCsfc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
