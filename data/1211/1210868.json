Told largely through archival video, the film combines recent interviews with each character and video footage from their days on access.  The result is five gripping vignettes covering different sides of the community and the era.  Carmen Banana is a drag queen icon of the 80’s gay community who lost most of his film crew to a new virus called AIDS. Livia is a geophysics Ph.D. student by day and a foxy Elvira-esque call-in host by night. Keith Kritselis makes headlines after staging an on-air shooting, a la Orson Welles.  Finally, a young music videographer named Dave Prewitt makes it his mission to start his own, better version of MTV, all focused on Austin music. Through each of their stories, we see the rise and fall of an era, the changing landscape of Austin, and the early roots of our current viral-video crazed world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qY3hS4T6AIgwK7yG3gKtNCsgHWr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When We Were Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qY3hS4T6AIgwK7yG3gKtNCsgHWr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
