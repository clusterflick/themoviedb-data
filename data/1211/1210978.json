Former employees guided the tour and gave an emotive background to life and work within its boundaries. The site is now protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.  The film draws comparisons between the stoic image of the headstocks left to stand watch, and the role of the volunteers who continue to tend the site and support the interpretation of its heritage.  The poem is read by my grandfather, a native of a mining town in North Nottinghamshire. His voice reflects the overlap in accents and dialect found between mining communities across the Midlands.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pJ4DsFFSRmd4bQAzJn8x4AjYIT7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Groundkeepers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Len Eley","original_name":"Len Eley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6565b4393d7454010be0cdea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Goldsmith","original_name":"Rebecca Goldsmith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6565b29a89d97f00e172d378","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Goldsmith","original_name":"Rebecca Goldsmith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6565b2aaa3491100fe2509d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJ4DsFFSRmd4bQAzJn8x4AjYIT7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Released as part of Birmingham Literature Festival","release_date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
