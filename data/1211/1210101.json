In his late teens, Mohamed Amin abandons his studies to pursue a career in photography which, over the course of thirty years, will turn him into a front-line cameraman extraordinaire - and, arguably, the most renowned photojournalist of his era. Training his candid lens across continents, Mo Amin's thirst for breaking news puts him repeatedly in harm's way - enduring weeks of torture, automatic arms fire, explosives and, ultimately, the amputation of his left arm - to become one of the most decorated news camera-man of all time. The documentary depicts Mo as an unbending, unforgiving and unapologetically rambunctious paterfamilias whose hunger for \"the story\" propels him to ever greater professional heights - often at the expense of those he cherishes.","popularity":0.2884,"poster_path":"/aXjGL9s5Wi9dnwWv9MzMYoPm2LZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camerapix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"2006-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mo & Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leul Abate","original_name":"Leul Abate","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6563440d706e5600c4bb9519","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolly Amin","original_name":"Dolly Amin","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"656344153679a1097906772a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farzana Amin","original_name":"Farzana Amin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6563441dfb5299013e2a8dfa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Amin","original_name":"Salim Amin","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6563442724418200ca779c06","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Belafonte","original_name":"Harry Belafonte","popularity":0.5959,"profile_path":"/8x9zZS36gSOKiTnUwoBqYKvnYg6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6563442da6c10401382a7552","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":205652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Mills","original_name":"Roger Mills","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656343dc8f26bc00ad26ffff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4397505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murad Rayani","original_name":"Murad Rayani","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656343eab234b900acfb8461","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0839906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aXjGL9s5Wi9dnwWv9MzMYoPm2LZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in Los Angeles","release_date":"2006-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
