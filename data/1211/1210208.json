Then I took out my phone, and filmed a 2 minute clip of the reflection in 144p resolution with a 500kbps bitrate. I moved the file over to my laptop and slowed down the footage to 4 minutes and saturated the colder hues. The soundscape is formed by the low bitrate hum of my room and a dragged version of Heal from Ico.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/byr3UFOYk1YwxVP9u2fQ98SC1FR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon from My Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eetu Fyhr","original_name":"Eetu Fyhr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563830b244182010cb56e14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/byr3UFOYk1YwxVP9u2fQ98SC1FR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
