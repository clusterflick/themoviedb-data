Miss Adelaide is offered a lucrative tour in America, but her contract already binds her to Europe. Only a hypothetical husband could cancel the Europe tour. Together with her suitors, Adelaide devises a plan – a marriage with an eight-day trial period with a handsome dowry! But neither millionaire will let the other one marry her. They both turn to the third man, Robert, whom they consider harmless. After the trial period, it turns out that no money will sway Robert’s love.
