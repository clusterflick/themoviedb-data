Mobilise: Selected Writings by Ian White”, which collects key critical writings by artist and curator. Found footage of a female biologist mimicking the call of the male Great Grey Owl is counterposed with video of the legs of women as they urinate in various wildernesses. The collision of these activities in landscape points towards an exuberant queer territoriality. This work includes a passage from “I am (for The Birds)”, the final text in the book “Here is Information. Mobilise: Selected Writings by Ian White”.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/A1ljvjo9vnTno58rMUyLlx7ALLy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passing as a Great Grey Owl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Prodger","original_name":"Charlotte Prodger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563490d7dfda6593174fd40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A1ljvjo9vnTno58rMUyLlx7ALLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
