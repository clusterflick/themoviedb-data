They are the heart of Morocco, home to Africa’s most beautiful landscapes and geography, with its own unique music, culture, and history. Join two friends as they cover the surrounding regions, right from the modern city of Fes to Medina, a place with old-world charm. As they jam under the night sky and participate in a traditional Gnawa ceremony, they encounter the diversity of a country that’s exotic and simple in equal parts.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart of Morocco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassan Hakmoun","original_name":"Hassan Hakmoun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65659ead156cc7012d54f548","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3085088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Horn","original_name":"Bob Horn","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65659eb6d954200138754a6e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nouamane Lahlou","original_name":"Nouamane Lahlou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65659ebe3d7454010be0c320","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Le Gall ","original_name":"Laurent Le Gall ","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65659ec76c0b360101fb20b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meloud Meskaoui","original_name":"Meloud Meskaoui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65659ed0d9542000ab64a4dd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Wieder","original_name":"Erik Wieder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65659e886c0b3600e4db9953","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Wieder","original_name":"Erik Wieder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65659e956c0b3600e4db995e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11152930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
