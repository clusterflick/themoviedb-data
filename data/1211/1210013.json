In a singular form that joins theatre and film, Christine Jatahy treats the subject of migration with infinite depth: “That which forces millions of individuals to be on the move. That which nationalism traps in refugee camps where life, suspended, elapses. No salvation for these men, these women, these children ripped from their ancestral homes with no promise of any future. A time that stretches endlessly where memories burn the heart, unable to move forward.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lingering Now, Our Odyssey II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1381913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiane Jatahy","original_name":"Christiane Jatahy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6562f400a6c10400e165b567","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
