Five decades of creative work intertwined with madness, jail time and violence, this film portrays a complex character. The manic depressive illness he suffered from trapped Kraus in a vicious cycle; each album recording ended in his hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital. Yet, his passion to create new music did not cease there. Kraus passed away unexpectedly in 2013 during the shooting of this film. He was 77. Combining archive footage with intimate interviews and scenes documented during a two year time span, the film unravels a different Kraus: human, tender, a weary warrior. We are offered a deeper look into a troubled, once-adored artist, from the perspective of his life's end.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/oeVhZNtgcZZa58dLMReaDv2dEyq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shmulik Kraus: Behind Blue Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmulik Kraus","original_name":"Shmulik Kraus","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":"/kDOBCslVZR65lxGHn02Fwyb0JaI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65646c83706e56011b4b37b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4399344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adi Harel","original_name":"Adi Harel","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65646c708f26bc0139f832da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4105274","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tVSZgwEuD87q7kEmnCHLE5vTYG2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/oeVhZNtgcZZa58dLMReaDv2dEyq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/gpcEYTSawRYV1qVLXA6AOXzDyGG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
