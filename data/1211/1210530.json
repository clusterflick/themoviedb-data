The train staff takes care of little Eva, but decide to send her to an orphanage so that she can have a formal education. At 18 years old, Eva must find a guardian before she’s thrown out onto the street. In a wicked twist of fate, Eva’s father, Count Iwan, seems unwittingly interested in the young beauty. Hopefully they realise their familiarly resemblances before it’s too late.
