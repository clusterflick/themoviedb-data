I didn’t know anything about this, but my friends thought it would be a nice idea if we filmed it. So we went over for an evening; black tie, dinner gown and all the rest of it. We changed a few light bulbs in the house and unobtrusively filmed the evening. I ended up making a 12-minute short with my daughter Elspeth taking sound.  – Richard Leacock","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen of Apollo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Leacock","original_name":"Richard Leacock","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/t3laii6SV2HYNvuQa910UmbHNQV.jpg","credit_id":"65654b03a8b2ca010bc0bd07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noel E.
