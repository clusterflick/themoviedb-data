Now the time has come to not only disassemble it. Instead, Joana sets out to destroy the artefact of pain completely. The gesture is made with fervour, tearing out the shelves and doors looks like retroactive resistance, what was pent up finds an outlet. At the same time, the ritual is characterised by gradual escalation: At first the director speaks of her relationship with her parents – a big sweat stain on her back already beginning to show –, in the end everything is in flames. The act is short, it lasts only a few minutes. And yet it allows an intimate insight that acquires a universal, strength-giving character as it unfolds.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":"/iQ1v0iCuSzdWSY8Z5HmH6FOihS8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Descprace","origin_country":""},{"id":230966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pituã Produções","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2023-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deliverance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Claude","original_name":"Joana Claude","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563851c7dfda659353b250a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2793191,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Letícia Batista","original_name":"Letícia Batista","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66646ef05181160b2e09fc51","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3198660,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Alencar","original_name":"Maria Alencar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66646f0bd78f8b75a7e70899","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016230,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"João Maria","original_name":"João Maria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66646f263fb55bba1809ef69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Catharine Pimentel","original_name":"Catharine Pimentel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66646f384e3938456ae9a8d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949997,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolau Domingues","original_name":"Nicolau Domingues","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66646f474f9bdc53d5e70895","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iQ1v0iCuSzdWSY8Z5HmH6FOihS8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":956}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jakarta Film Week","release_date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"66th DOK Leipzig - International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film","release_date":"2023-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
