He proves himself not only strong enough to kill his rival, the tribe's stalwart warrior, in a struggle for the girl, but is able to make a magic flute which can and does restore the girl, now lying dead. In the closing scenes, the picture shows a short glimpse of modern life which suggests that the old myth is being played, in part, again.","popularity":0.4337,"poster_path":"/lH9BZoYmVPvdEwklzESByrZM9yP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Long Ago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wheeler Oakman","original_name":"Wheeler Oakman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/4F4BCjUnk4h8P2QLRaKhE46OJSC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dreamer","credit_id":"656384f12da846011eb5ed12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1690990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Eyton","original_name":"Bessie Eyton","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/sWsS8cXywwkbyEpZacZoHQx9oT8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Starlight","credit_id":"656384d1fb5299010350aa78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Clark","original_name":"Frank Clark","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Starlight's Father","credit_id":"6563851f7dfda6593265b007","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Indian Warrior","credit_id":"6563853d8f26bc00c59d8e22","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Otto","original_name":"Henry Otto","popularity":0.1674,"profile_path":"/3K5x9toiUwcAtz8LdzziFfG74sR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Medicine Man","credit_id":"65638552fb529900aeda0d6f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3319652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Hutchison","original_name":"William Hutchison","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/bNxa76nRsYJaxuoomEzGhLBHD3h.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Curator of the Museum","credit_id":"6563857fb234b900acfb979f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Campbell","original_name":"Colin Campbell","popularity":0.316,"profile_path":"/dGmWZLBzh1sQSTNDgRU1itpeYu5.jpg","credit_id":"656385b5b234b900acfb97ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lanier Bartlett","original_name":"Lanier Bartlett","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656386a07dfda6593265b07a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Nicholas Selig","original_name":"William Nicholas Selig","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/je7EvEsxx161PCXuzXFwRCjrABF.jpg","credit_id":"656386ccb234b900e2c7ca1b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003007","wikidata_id":"Q3149730","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lH9BZoYmVPvdEwklzESByrZM9yP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":230457,"name":"early america"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
