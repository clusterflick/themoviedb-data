Denton and the girl are mutually attracted and to Denton comes a vague but haunting belief that they have met before. Worn out by overstudy, he becomes seriously ill with rain fever and the mind pictures he has of his fair neighbor fade into a vision of a prehistoric existence, where he wanders as a stone age savage, meets and loves the girl of his heart, who also lives in that strange world. There also is the conflict between wealth and poverty, the father's choice opposed to the daughter's. The prehistoric Denton finally wins out after struggling with a savage rival and wild beasts as well. Just so the modern Denton finally conquers over his modem rival.","popularity":1.3206,"poster_path":"/smCk2JHYGTMnhdQe0dIjugpXW6I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An exciting drama of a tale of rivalry prehistoric and modern","title":"Race Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.O.
