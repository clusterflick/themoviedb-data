Ned has a pet goldfish, a clumsy love of Latin music and a crush on a girl named Penelope. Ned and Penelope get along well but to his great frustration, Penelope has put him in the friend zone. Ned wants to escape this friendly fate; he aspires a more intimate path. So he writes her a story. Ned makes up characters that directly relate to his relationship with Penelope, and these characters interact as the story is being written. His plan is to give her the note so she may accept him as more than a friend. In this process he finds the true girl of his dreams.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The F Word","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2326513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Hurry","original_name":"Cameron Hurry","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/57fMQqhps3oynEBRS6Xj9wwYY35.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ned","credit_id":"6563f85524418200ca77e0ea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4398702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kieran Murray","original_name":"Kieran Murray","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563f8017dfda659304c13e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3585554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
