Martin, Caoimhín and Dennis have been recognised for balancing traditional rigour with an energy that seems entirely new. Thomas has been identified with the independent rock scene for his work with artists as diverse as the National, Glen Hansard, and Antony and the Johnsons. Iarla has made many ground breaking recordings with the Afro Celt Sound System, his distinctive voice venturing far beyond the boundaries of any one genre. The film not only depicts the Gloaming working together in Grouse Lodge studios in County Westmeath, Ireland, but also reveals the profound connection between them as players and as players with their audience.","popularity":0.1155,"poster_path":"/iTxNAdYbxWY9x35U6oLMt85sEeg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gloaming: Moment to Moment","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4400345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Hayes","original_name":"Martin Hayes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65650b91b234b900ff2482d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4400346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Cahill","original_name":"Dennis Cahill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65650bac24418200ebe5a20d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iarla O'Lionaird","original_name":"Iarla O'Lionaird","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65650bbe24418200ca784725","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673072,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Bartlett","original_name":"Thomas Bartlett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65650c43d9554b013af2fd53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2839094,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Caoimhin O'Raghallaigh","original_name":"Caoimhin O'Raghallaigh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65650c5a7dfda659353bd03c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4400344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phillip King","original_name":"Phillip King","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65650b7624418200ad5f897d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nuala O’Connor","original_name":"Nuala O’Connor","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65650b7fd9554b013af2fd0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tLbEX0VOvc2PB3TH1evie3FqWy9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGq5YI63kB3O9e6CHYKCZueKLeJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArvH38JMM04hku8j0l4a2abwQIA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mp1PLg7VobUijNr5bSdubkPnLkx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iTxNAdYbxWY9x35U6oLMt85sEeg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"An introduction to The Gloaming","key":"twpy1jwRsFk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-12-18T15:45:11.000Z","id":"65650ac33679a1097648902e"}]}}}
