Reynivellir is also a beach in a country that is a musical sonnet, and this is so because the mental image does not always connect the articulated parts of a sensation, it is systematic, but aleatory, and it is from these notions of the field of observation, that it approaches and moves away from understanding, linking and unlinking forms, movements, sounds, sensations and knowledge.","popularity":0.228,"poster_path":"/cG32d0kV66zO2Ao1y0oUlwndd00.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"REYNIVELLIR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4400512,"known_for_department":"Visual
