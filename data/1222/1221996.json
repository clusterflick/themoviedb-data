In the mythical realm, we learn how Raven finds riches in the harvest of the salmon, only to lose everything through a thoughtless act against the Spirit of the Salmon. So too does modern man jeopardize his living from the sea by heedless action. Images of ancient spear-fishing and smoke-houses contrast with images of today's Indigenous people operating a seiner and working in a cooperative cannery.","popularity":0.4386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salmon People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Austin","original_name":"Frank Austin","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Raven","credit_id":"6587fee3e295b4712d582e36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darlene Malczewska","original_name":"Darlene Malczewska","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Salmon Woman","credit_id":"6587fef6b0cd20534a579da0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25361,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Westman","original_name":"Tony Westman","popularity":0.1826,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6587ff78e295b470535864c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25361,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Westman","original_name":"Tony Westman","popularity":0.1826,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6587ffceea7b0e5f498fb3f4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Jones","original_name":"Peter Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6587fffb325a51577e01e07f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731781,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shelah Reljic","original_name":"Shelah Reljic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6587ffe1fad8e95d228e20bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446122,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Kit McLeod","original_name":"Brian Kit McLeod","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6587ff9d325a51577e01e056","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4446130,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George Johnson","original_name":"George Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6588000e4fd14172525ff6a0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226403","wikidata_id":"Q123288007","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195469,"name":"first nations"},{"id":215522,"name":"british columbia"},{"id":228775,"name":"native american folklore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
