The resulting film contains an intimate documentation of the most radical Jewish outpost in all the West Bank. The threat of evacuation hangs over their heads as they confront the Israeli government, its security forces, court system and their Palestinians neighbors. Rebellious, often lawless, and sometimes violent, they are guided by an ideology that knows no compromise. Lerner's intense, nonstop profile of the Hilltop Youth is a seat-of-your-pants journey into the center of the extreme national-religious settler movement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oYlvwsbpPPjGT2jhAz6TE6POVoz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God's Messengers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5223104","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oYlvwsbpPPjGT2jhAz6TE6POVoz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
