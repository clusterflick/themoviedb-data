Joseph watches from the car as his girlfriend, Tallie, is consoled by her ex outside the vet (while Joseph’s car has a penis spray-painted on it). Later at home, Joseph still feels antsy about Tallie’s reconnection with her ex, as he’s offered a glass of ‘WILK’ (wine+milk) soon claimed by Tallie’s roommate, an eccentric music producer. Having learned what the titular WILK means, we can now cut to a boxing match between a milk mascot and a wine mascot while a hip hop track plays. Delivered as a medley of bizarre shifts and barely discernible story beats, the film is intriguingly chaotic and one-of-a-kind.","popularity":0.3033,"poster_path":"/lJRKJmpCcsmNEet2cL4N9F2bsvy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183323,"logo_path":"/qhHLRFF381CvThxqy3JLJCfZq5U.png","name":"Pogi
