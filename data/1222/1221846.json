They have satirical, comedic, religious, and disturbing overtones... but to Chauncey and his Dad, this is normal. After a while of the cartoons and Chauncey eating a sausage and then throwing it up, the cartoons inspire Chauncey to ask a series of philosophical questions to his Dad. The questions involve what happens after death, the meaning of life, and Chances asking about his identity and why he’s different.","popularity":0.2772,"poster_path":"/piDVPfDywVJNy9PFvCQLdjKZMjC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TreatsforBeasts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Diniz","original_name":"Jordan Diniz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Daddy","credit_id":"65873795e295b46fc7584c17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Diniz","original_name":"Jordan Diniz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chauncey (voice)","credit_id":"658771754da3d463a141bedd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4294320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Diniz","original_name":"Jordan Diniz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658737a65aba3268f1b8fc81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/piDVPfDywVJNy9PFvCQLdjKZMjC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":826,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/prCRilWtX37lbc5Yr60iPDnTHjU.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":551},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swzYp72rHcGtroiqaQBQCcYpcrp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":607}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6300,"name":"puppet"},{"id":209220,"name":"live action and animation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":295182,"name":"existential"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
