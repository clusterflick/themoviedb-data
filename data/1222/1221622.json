Henry Fonda and the roles he played merge into a dazzling and conflicted figure. A very private man who thought he had “no good answers to anything” becomes the unlikely motor of a parallel history. His voice, recorded during his last interview in 1981, and his onscreen avatars guide us through America’s past and present – on a road trip from the village of Fonda, NY, across the Midwest to the Pacific; from 1651 to the 1980s and the presidency of another movie actor. It takes many places and times and characters to imagine an invisible republic – the United States of Fonda.","popularity":0.8228,"poster_path":"/sIwhdJ2EqC292XD6L0H143HLhgL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medea Film
