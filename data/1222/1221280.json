What really happens to people in isolation? Is there a difference in the effects of solitude by chance, by choice, or, as in the case in some prisons, by force? Enter Colorado State Penitentiary to witness prisoners on the edge and the guards who watch over them. Then, look at experiments on whether isolation dramatically alters behaviour and ongoing new research on how solitary could actually cause long-term mental problems like paranoia, disorientation and delirium.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":189457,"logo_path":"/a0ruFlMfEs2pTOLZ1tPHqzDH7Fc.png","name":"National Geographic Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Solitary Confinement: Redeemed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Inside Solitary Confinement","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Inside: Solitary Confinement","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Solitary Confinement","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
