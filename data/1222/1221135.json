His usual clients are movie stars and business leaders. This programme takes him to a Sixth Form College in London to work with school pupils, to test his claim that he can teach anyone a language in a week - with no reading, writing or homework. The film also explores his personal history - as a hero of the French Resistance during WW II.  Nigelâ€™s documentary with the 85 year old Michel Thomas was the first time that Thomas allowed his techniques to be made public. The subsequent success of the film transformed Thomas into a global celebrity and his method into one of the most highly regarded in the world of education.","popularity":0.1463,"poster_path":"/6D6GEV3rbQpGQ6X3TnlKNNBaKcy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Language Master","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Thomas","original_name":"Michel Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67e45c962074b0ee560012a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Allen","original_name":"Woody Allen","popularity":1.372,"profile_path":"/wcPQgZLDibuej1RwNTy1R2U2ZJw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67e45db82580eef1e800142f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Marks","original_name":"Leo Marks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"67e45f54f8cba94bbcba1a4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony","original_name":"Anthony","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Student","credit_id":"67e45fe72580eef1e800158e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Levy","original_name":"Nigel Levy","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e45d06b8fc398996108854","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329979,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Brennan","original_name":"Michael Brennan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e45d52f8cba94bbcba1a16","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Levy","original_name":"Nigel Levy","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e45d5cb8fc39899610887e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018668,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Fairhead","original_name":"David Fairhead","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e45d70f846794e991085f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hdES9O7Yd6jqUw1nPtq9B67fJva.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6D6GEV3rbQpGQ6X3TnlKNNBaKcy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":5996,"name":"language"},{"id":209792,"name":"candid"},{"id":317819,"name":"french"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Language Master, a film about Michel Thomas","key":"mr_NUWhYASg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-23T19:55:24.000Z","id":"67e45ff5421eb8c331ba187c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Michel Thomas, The Language Master Pt 1 of 3 (full length at https://youtu.be/PFnObQKDV_0)","key":"P8jhy7ZQC38","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-02T14:00:40.000Z","id":"67e45e2e5e8e5c9bacba1a0a"}]}}}
