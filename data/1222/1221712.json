It’s a special moment in which the threads of his life become inextricably entwined into a knot. Entering the adult world and slipping back towards childhood. Studying, football matches with mates, and family life centred around his father’s workshop.

A moment when Andreas has to choose, a knot he tries to unravel, overcome or flee.","popularity":0.1734,"poster_path":"/dPZzI2JEmPFmL44m8K3AjBWxNMI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98185,"logo_path":"/gxVbK10TbKaXI66lXqWmpvkIqvW.png","name":"Haute école d'art et de design – Genève (HEAD – Genève)","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2010-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Ami","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Friend","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baptiste Gilliéron","original_name":"Baptiste Gilliéron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xD1nduVsWmsOF6R5YBKZ8uSESz4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Andreas","credit_id":"6586e8da47721559d3436d1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Berney","original_name":"Pascal Berney","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Freddy","credit_id":"6586e8e9fad8e95d228dabcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Guélat","original_name":"Simon Guélat","popularity":0.0834,"profile_path":"/6AKSYxylJqbnqn7bY0YD0UPQWu1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Samuel","credit_id":"6586e8f7688cd058ab83ffbe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3395197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Parizot","original_name":"Pascal Parizot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maurice","credit_id":"6586e908596a915fc0401332","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2880497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwenn Deschenaux","original_name":"Gwenn Deschenaux","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e9c25aba3266b0b94acc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Kuenzy","original_name":"Adrien Kuenzy","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e99bfad8e95d228dac20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2476854,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michel Bühler","original_name":"Michel Bühler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e956e295b470535816b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607908,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriel Lobos","original_name":"Gabriel Lobos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e988e295b46fc7583b1d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2156094,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erline O'Donovan-Clarke","original_name":"Erline O'Donovan-Clarke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e9ad2dffd85bcc44fe3e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Kuenzy","original_name":"Adrien Kuenzy","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e93f5aba32660cb96a33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4445183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Kuenzy","original_name":"Adrien Kuenzy","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6586e92e2dffd85bcc44fe24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1850380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oqh2s5x5USy05zPB8ql5fmUM05S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dPZzI2JEmPFmL44m8K3AjBWxNMI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5153,"name":"son"},{"id":5905,"name":"father"},{"id":33494,"name":"couple"},{"id":156478,"name":"boyfriend"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
