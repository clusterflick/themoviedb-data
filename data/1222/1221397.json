Starting with the Oslo peace accords and continuing through the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and the ongoing war in Gaza, the documentary draws on years of reporting and is an incisive look at the long history of failed peace efforts and violent conflict in the region — and the increasing tensions between Israel and its ally, the U.S., over the war’s catastrophic toll and what comes next.","popularity":0.9496,"poster_path":"/rZIAF8ETc79ST83KOC9NRf8J9a7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Netanyahu, America & the Road to War in Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Lyman","original_name":"Will Lyman","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/ymifKdrtMFEZVYTvOmYoshPg7HR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65876add4da3d464ca4155c7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Ezell Kinlaw","original_name":"Lauren Ezell Kinlaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65876a7222e4807f66c10d4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2212297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Jacoby","original_name":"James Jacoby","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65876d51325a51577e019489","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451058,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John E.
