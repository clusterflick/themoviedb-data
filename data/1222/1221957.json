Here, Minae a baseball-playing young girl tries to compete in an otherwise all-boys team, but has a hard time of it. According to the coach she only seems to be lacking a bit of self-confidence. On her way back to the bench she stumbles over a baseball bat that the legendary player Matsui Hideki rammed into the ground. Supposedly any player who swings this bat gains the strength of a real baseball player, and with it any ball can be hit. Time for Conan to take fate into his own hands... for Minae's sake.","popularity":0.3291,"poster_path":"/wLIyiZMx2sTWT8lGelrFHNYKhBA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detective Conan OVA 12: The Miracle of Excalibur","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"名侦探柯南 OVA12","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"传说中的球棒的奇迹","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuharu Kamanaka","original_name":"鎌仲史陽","popularity":0.28,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589b8b407216666d4a6e191","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gosho Aoyama","original_name":"青山剛昌","popularity":0.4605,"profile_path":"/uDHV8k83exNF4gx3LmRSCYimBxe.jpg","credit_id":"670ab9a44111be4f027450f2","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wLIyiZMx2sTWT8lGelrFHNYKhBA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
