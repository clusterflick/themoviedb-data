Living 150 years before Martin Luther, John Wycliffe has been called the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\". As the planet Venus appears on the horizon just before dawn, so John Wycliffe appeared in Europe just before the reawakening of Christianity in the 16th century. In \"Morningstar\", we follow in his footsteps as Wycliffe takes on the mammoth medieval powers of church and state.","popularity":0.1058,"poster_path":"/4bEbv24tf4yWLqinlkcs6QZbujw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the begining was the Word","title":"Morningstar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Morgan","original_name":"Jared Morgan","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/jQoQL3z18SvsJmYt3xhJh0G0AvR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Wycliffe","credit_id":"6585923698f1f154600a235b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4036969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Houden","original_name":"Marcus Houden","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"William Courteney","credit_id":"65859256d64ac25137142c15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3775398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Buckeridge","original_name":"Jon Buckeridge","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"John of Gaunt","credit_id":"65859272223e204110954784","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4443565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard O'Sullivan","original_name":"Bernard O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Archbishop Sudbury","credit_id":"658592b403726419e67b9230","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murdo MacLeod","original_name":"Murdo MacLeod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6585935f28d7fe58653a0bdf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murdo MacLeod","original_name":"Murdo MacLeod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65859353223e20422894ebd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16823480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fPKJ9QXhvmVopek0yMJVIUeZ6oz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jeudhoufCoaxpVdAAOV3DsFMVX6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4bEbv24tf4yWLqinlkcs6QZbujw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
