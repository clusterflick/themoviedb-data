Contains songs from their first two albums, The Rhythm Of Youth and Folk Of The '80s Pt.3. Although best known for their massive hit, 'The Safety Dance', Men Without Hats were more than just a one-trick pony. Led by vocalist Ivan, MWH's wry humor and eccentric approach to their music was misunderstood by many and they remain one of the most underappreciated bands of their time.  Helping to usher in the synth-pop craze of the 1980s, the Quebec-based collective Men Without Hats were led by brothers Ivan and Stefan Doroschuk, and are best known for their 1982 single \"The Safety Dance.\" This live performance was held in 1985 in Montreal, Canada, and features that hit in addition to \"Antarctica,\" \"Modern Dancing,\" and \"I Got The Message.\"","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men Without Hats - Live Hats!","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66246,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Doroschuk","original_name":"Ivan Doroschuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6632894eaf4324012253be61","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
