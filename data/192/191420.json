Embittered, Adriaan stayed on in his diabetic father’s mansion, eventually marrying the sick man’s beautiful nurse Marie.On the day of his father’s funeral, which Adriaan does not attend, Paul returns. The brothers’ meeting is not friendly: a shot rings out, and one lies dead. Adriaan tells his manservant, Freddie, that he killed Paul in self-defence. As the two are trying to dispose of the body, a detective knocks on the door. He has been hired to find Paul, who may be a beneficiary in the old man’s will. And to make matters worse, Marie is becoming suspicious as well.","popularity":0.0951,"poster_path":"/AogJbcB92kdeqi8sPOWrd087sv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1972-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brother's Shades","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cobus Rossouw","original_name":"Cobus Rossouw","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c839251416c910f73dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie du Toit","original_name":"Marie du Toit","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c839251416c910f73e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pieter Fourie","original_name":"Pieter Fourie","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c839251416c910f73e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louw Verwey","original_name":"Louw Verwey","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c839251416c910f73e9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dirk de Villiers","original_name":"Dirk de Villiers","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c839251416c910f73d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2035572","wikidata_id":"Q13035503","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AogJbcB92kdeqi8sPOWrd087sv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":604}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
