Within this self-sustaining society based on non-violence, vegetarianism and respect for the earth, members willingly took a vow of poverty, lived in converted buses, grew their own food and home-delivered babies. Born and raised in this alternative community, filmmakers and sisters Rena and Nadine return for the first time since leaving in 1985. Finally ready to face the past after years of hiding their upbringing, they chart the rise and fall of Americaâ€™s largest utopian socialist experiment and their own family tree. The nascent idealism of a community destroyed, in part, by its own success is reflected in the personal story of a family unit split apart by differences. American Commune finds inspiration in failure, humour in deprivation and, most surprisingly, that communal values are alive and well in the next generation.","popularity":0.37,"poster_path":"/7zXtvKCNr4E8m6TvmkIh83KhA0F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mundo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Commune","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Amerikaniko koinovio","type":"festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Amerykanska komuna","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250980,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Kroll","original_name":"Jon Kroll","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615a947c51a64e008fe65dac","department":"Writing","job":"Story Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Levine","original_name":"Michael Levine","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54409563c3a368606a0008e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadine Mundo","original_name":"Nadine Mundo","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bee5eb9c3a368189f0108c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rena Mundo Croshere","original_name":"Rena Mundo Croshere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bee5e770e0a2626630113ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2960688","wikidata_id":"Q16691780","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3uoVOopyJi8q18n5kPxee40xlWU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tFjPmTBf0T7QReMN7FcW553c1fI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAIcg0PLif7GLBJSdm38wZ2J321.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7zXtvKCNr4E8m6TvmkIh83KhA0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hot Docs","release_date":"2013-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"American Commune Trailer","key":"AaToe1m7DGU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-11-01T20:01:57.000Z","id":"6105ddd5fdc146005c2a9702"}]}}}
