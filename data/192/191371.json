Older salarymen pay to wait for calls from teenage girls, discreet meetings are arranged, and handfuls of yen are exchanged for a quick session of enjo kosai, or paid sex with a high school girl. Plenty of girls are doing it—some to make money for fancy, fashionable clothes and accessories, others to set a trap to rob and brutalize the old perverts. But the Valentine Call staff, horny young Ogisu and the vaguely sinister, makeup-coated Mr. Kuni, have a nasty plan of their own. Listening in on the enjo kosai calls, they conspire to trick the girls into giving them free sex. Mr. Kuni even has a twisted concept behind this scheme. He calls it enboku, his campaign to humiliate the teenage girls, drive them away from prostitution and purify Japan.","popularity":0.8146,"poster_path":"/66M1VbnGcfwVRVouMzeAsvi7iz6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4673,"logo_path":"/tXMheRYcKXCK1a90NRESqO1ibhQ.png","name":"King Records","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop the Bitch Campaign","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Enjo-kôsai bokumetsu undô","type":"Original_title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koharu Toono","original_name":"Koharu Toono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c809251416c910f6f8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Honami Seki","original_name":"Honami Seki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c809251416c910f6f8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayaka Makabe","original_name":"Ayaka Makabe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c809251416c910f6f93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jutemu Nakajima","original_name":"Jutemu Nakajima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Juteemu Nakajima","credit_id":"52fe4c809251416c910f6f9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken'ichi Endô","original_name":"遠藤憲一","popularity":0.8973,"profile_path":"/5NyLtChKpQ0KLiYjZ3aSDylBIou.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c809251416c910f6fbf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tarō Suwa","original_name":"諏訪太朗","popularity":0.4951,"profile_path":"/wLbAf2eRaMpGVH4tz0OMvXM2eS3.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"549ac3889251413129001a2d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口祥行","popularity":0.4173,"profile_path":"/jAaHxP854jQzsqRhx6vCQ05hwHc.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"549ac3a7c3a3682f23001a5e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikio Sato","original_name":"佐藤幹雄","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"549ac3be9251415dc10011af","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kosuke Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木浩介","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/5F0MJfS792lSnv6b6dwa7yv6Ar.jpg","credit_id":"5692b1f8c3a3684cfc002c71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077978,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tetsuya Koshiba","original_name":"Tetsuya Koshiba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a0b596c3a36858c800d195","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35636,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hideo Yamamoto","original_name":"山本英夫","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/pKyZBecbyyQzeZbpDKPAzgObUCW.jpg","credit_id":"56a14f00c3a36858dc00f200","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1508420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kosuke Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木浩介","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/5F0MJfS792lSnv6b6dwa7yv6Ar.jpg","credit_id":"56a14f48c3a36858ce00f7e7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0314021","wikidata_id":"Q3973853","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hv8N3PHXHxkfwvLE0ErPvrxiDDV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/66M1VbnGcfwVRVouMzeAsvi7iz6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13141,"name":"based on manga"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"18+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
