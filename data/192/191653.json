During his rite of passage, he's determined to tame a painted pony. He approaches manhood while his peaceful clan is set upon by a nearby tribe willing to break a treaty. He must also contend with the kidnapping of three young women from his village, his pony's illness behind enemy lines, his mother's coma after a rattlesnake bite, the medicine man's urging that he sacrifice what he loves best, the attack of a cougar and of wolves, and his own injury while alone in the woods. His kindness, bravery, and quick thinking serve him well, but rescue come from an unexpected source.","popularity":0.6167,"poster_path":"/dxthVgNL9XHYTkFe2B6eO30LBbg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indian Paint","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Auf der Suche nach Mukapo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Crawford","original_name":"Johnny Crawford","popularity":0.7215,"profile_path":"/osonXywvOUJjGh8ykF9dOD2eR72.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nishko","credit_id":"52fe4c8d9251416c910f87a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Silverheels","original_name":"Jay Silverheels","popularity":0.3963,"profile_path":"/rrHuwINW4UtYEurYd6jmg7cO9QM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chief Hevatanu","credit_id":"52fe4c8d9251416c910f87bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Hogan","original_name":"Pat Hogan","popularity":0.3131,"profile_path":"/jCGkkNZ8r0d0GTJNo0XRz0uNc2Y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sutamakis","credit_id":"52fe4c8d9251416c910f87a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George J.
