It is a story of the ‘nobleman-bandit’, Brennan O'Malley, who is captured and imprisoned, but an attempt to drown him through flooding his cell fails. Recaptured after his escape from prison, he overwhelms a soldier and escapes again. He then holds up Lord Hastings and changes into his clothes. He escapes through a secret passage with Betty, Lady Lorrequer whom he had earlier rescued and with whom he had fallen in love. The couple cross a chasm with the aid of a human chain to elude Lord Hastings' troop of soldiers. In the pursuit, Hastings falls into the sea and is killed, while Brennan and Betty escape by ship.","popularity":0.0754,"poster_path":"/zSFCYHKhEovL0IX3l4Zz1325KNA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solax Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brennan of the Moor","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barney Gilmore","original_name":"Barney Gilmore","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/1zssnBqPf7XYLeuNe0Nid3EQ6kF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Brennan of the Moor","credit_id":"601780d07314a1003bf47c77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Swayne","original_name":"Marian Swayne","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/mL3K4B1gNFTpBCldmFdKJXxvwK7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lady Betty","credit_id":"601780d662e86f003e49635d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Levering","original_name":"Joseph Levering","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/ytdTe7U84Cn7HDF3BNV2j9s95td.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lt.
