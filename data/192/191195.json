Americans have been lulled into a false sense of security by cheap energy that has allowed us to spread endlessly into our landscape. We are trapped behind the wheels of our automobiles. With the demand for oil outpacing the Earth's ability to supply it, this suburban living arrangement will fail. America's love affair with the automobile is unsustainable and, like Nero, we are fiddling away, confident that tomorrow will be as promising as today. The wake up call is coming.","popularity":0.5673,"poster_path":"/z88piLvpeCjPYNK56EgTeU7I4kW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Consequences of Suburbanization","title":"Sprawling from Grace","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sprawling from Grace: Driven to Madness","type":"long title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David M.
