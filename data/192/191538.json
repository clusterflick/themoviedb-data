It is an original work, following the tale of a secondary figure from the stories. Judge William Minty has spent his entire adult life policing the violent streets of Mega-City One and now he's slowing down. When a lapse of judgement almost ends his life, he knows that it's time to quit.

lawless.","popularity":0.093,"poster_path":"/w7zper5JCpMG7psFGN2HbKeTWL1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Irradiated Hound
