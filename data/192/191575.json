Designed to test the existence of the proverbial “God particle” and the beginnings of matter, the LHC was built below numerous towns above the 27-kilometre subterranean circle between the Franco-Swiss border. Rather than merely exploring the entrails of this colossal machine, this film poses questions to those who walk above it about the utility of such projects and the insatiable human need to discover the origins of human life. The Circle is an unusually incisive assemblage of opinions on scientific endeavors and the ineluctable human need to find answers.
