Director Johan van der Keuken made three short films about his friend and inspiration Lucebert. The black-and-white film Lucebert, dichter-schilder was shot in 1962 on a very low budget. In 1967 Een film voor Lucebert was released. Unlike Van der Keuken's first film about Lucebert, this one had a political message. It is a film for an artist about the world. Lucebert died in May 1994. A reaction to his death is contained in Als je weet waar ik ben zoek me dan. In this film, shot in Lucebert's studio, the presence of the artist is evoked once more through his absence. In Lucebert, Time and Farewell, Van der Keuken puts the three films together into a new entity that exploits the tension between changing and standing still over a period of 32 years.","popularity":0.0529,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54905,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belbo Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1994-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucebert, Time and Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Lucebert, temps et adieu","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Lucebert","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c779251416c910f5c25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110403","wikidata_id":"Q3265113","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
