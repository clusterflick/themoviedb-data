And the most forceful. The director of The Sorrow and the Pity shares with us stories of his exceptionally rich life in this light-hearted yet bitter escapade though the century and the movies. Son of the great Max Ophuls, he is generous in his admiration. We also meet Jeanne Moreau, Bertolt Brecht, Ernst Lubitsch, Otto Preminger, Woody Allen, Stanley Kubrick and of course François Truffaut. There are no great filmmakers without a memory, so here is the memory shop of Marcel Ophuls.","popularity":0.2575,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ain't Misbehavin","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Un Voyageur","type":"Original"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Moreau","original_name":"Jeanne Moreau","popularity":0.9068,"profile_path":"/lsIlRbcStJev5n1mypIeUUYKWuy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c909251416c910f8e8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Costa-Gavras","original_name":"Costa-Gavras","popularity":0.3382,"profile_path":"/shKz8ntEDXRu44fYk9c5kZsUu4k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c909251416c910f8e8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamilton Fish","original_name":"Hamilton Fish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c909251416c910f8e93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Allen","original_name":"Woody Allen","popularity":1.372,"profile_path":"/wcPQgZLDibuej1RwNTy1R2U2ZJw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4c909251416c910f8e97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Ophüls","original_name":"Marcel Ophüls","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/euSUNCBbdb2RnnPJ2sfwTWaK14w.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c909251416c910f8e9b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Ophüls","original_name":"Marcel Ophüls","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/euSUNCBbdb2RnnPJ2sfwTWaK14w.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c909251416c910f8e87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20559,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sophie Brunet","original_name":"Sophie Brunet","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d2dd2147c009fcaba1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Eskenazi","original_name":"Frank Eskenazi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d351e9225004f9300f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2871222","wikidata_id":"Q16681824","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
