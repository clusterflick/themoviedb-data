The central character of this film is Isidro. In simple, clear speech, he broaches every question shaking our contemporary world: the scandalous, toxic supremacy of globalized multinationals and financialization, the cultural catastrophe of religious proselytism, the danger of climate change and displacement, the vicious cynicism of overfishing, the folly or ignorance of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or ethnic origin, pollution, overconsumption and of course the terrifying throes of nature, with its angry storms, floods and earthquakes.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/mKLwv5s2XNSm2glGzyVRpg2zxoV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":355,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The natural time of a long now","title":"Isidro Guerra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Daireaux","original_name":"François Daireaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61336bf94a22260062cb7713","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mKLwv5s2XNSm2glGzyVRpg2zxoV.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
