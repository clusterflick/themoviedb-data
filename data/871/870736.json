Due to the lack of maintenance and altered ideas about design in public space, the city hall – once a showpiece – is no longer beloved and is threatened by demolition. The film ends with a number of slides that were made by the architect during the opening in 1974: visitors gaze with admiration at an unknown modernity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aBUU10idlcTeKt6qDWk0njJGUnU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City Hall Ahlen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arianne Olthaar","original_name":"Arianne Olthaar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6134b4c7e3fa2f008f2fec13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aBUU10idlcTeKt6qDWk0njJGUnU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://lightcone.org/en/film-12105-rathaus-ahlen","release_date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
