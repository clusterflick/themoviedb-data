Trained at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Drouin became in some ways the heir to Alexandre Alexeïeff when he began working with the Alexeïeff-Parker pinhole screen in 1974. Recounting his relationship with the filmmaker and inventor, coming back with lucidity and precision on the whole of his own filmography, Jacques Drouin delivers here a precious testimony on creation. Enriched with numerous excerpts and unpublished images from the filmmaker's personal archives, Jacques Drouin en relief is both the adventure of a lifetime and a valuable lesson in cinema.","popularity":0.0947,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacques Drouin en relief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Drouin","original_name":"Jacques Drouin","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/yQNUjnMj4Ky9VNC1uwele2U3vwd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"613259c92cde980062d05c50","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Fortin","original_name":"Guillaume Fortin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613259dda39d0b0093b483bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
