That mission leads him to an old, abandoned farmhouse, where a community of rarely seen eastern quolls resides. To find out more about these enigmatic, small marsupials, Simon packs his cameras and moves in with them for a year. However, this will be no simple field study. Over the next twelve months, he and his quolls will encounter invasive predators, opportunistic thieves, and the worst bushfire in Australia's history.","popularity":0.0584,"poster_path":"/49iJPSnHAhCuo86lBRylO9W538P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tasmania: Curious Life of Quolls","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49iJPSnHAhCuo86lBRylO9W538P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
