The next night Don, newly un-virginized, persuades his girlfriend Betty to have sex with him, too. Soon Don and Nicky discover that they have sores and itching \"down there\", and Don goes to see the school doctor. He is told that he has syphilis, and to tell Betty and have her get examined. It turns out she has syphilis, too. Can their disease, caused by Don's outrageous behavior--which, as the doctor sternly notes, \"is condemned by society\"--be successfully treated in time?","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":"/vmNRbjGgu60CsphQz6AWa8RMW7r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Innocent Party","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harper Barnes","original_name":"Harper Barnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"613175c95ab81a002dc50e19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659570,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shelby Storck","original_name":"Shelby Storck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Carson","credit_id":"613175decede690060f126c5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herk Harvey","original_name":"Herk Harvey","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/3QxMAsXAfmxJYDFq1PwlQnk90ce.jpg","credit_id":"613175ff5e1200004397c84d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Travis","original_name":"Margaret Travis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61317617924ce5002af454b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0221277","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vmNRbjGgu60CsphQz6AWa8RMW7r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1001}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
