Yet in her sixties, while grief-stricken, she courageously faces up to her most tragic heartbreak, writes her greatest work, becomes her truest self, learns to master \"the art of losing,\" and earns her place as one of North America's greatest poets. Transplanted Nova Scotia filmmaker John D. Scott foregrounds how Bishop's journey is indelibly connected to her Nova Scotian heritage.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/alXpUCErTPgjloB4zhRfv61BFem.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elizabeth Bishop and the Art of Losing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John D.
