They are confined, deconfined, reconfined. Together they play Phèdre by Jean Racine. This film is a real immersion in a theatrical troupe that wants to be, despite everything. Through Phèdre and her people, it is also the history of the place of Art that is questioned: what is the point of creating if it is to do so against one's artistic requirements? Out of resistance, no doubt.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/eX9nGOKLfaI0mYyhBXOVSE36kJA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":53509,"logo_path":"/xmJMAss7BDsQPvODjYkDQKiNhUX.png","name":"Wrong Men","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phèdre against Covid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Méryl Fortunat-Rossi","original_name":"Méryl Fortunat-Rossi","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6134efb264f7160020eb05e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15261022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/eX9nGOKLfaI0mYyhBXOVSE36kJA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1357}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
