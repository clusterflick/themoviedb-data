His deadpan \"northern\" delivery, a rubber-like miserable face (which he himself described as resembling \"a sack of spanners\"), his fishwife impersonations, comic monologues and a unique talent for just-off-key piano playing would leave them screaming for more.  His sour, downturned grin, his cheeky flash of the eyes and an audience in uncontrollable hysterics are among the memories gleaned here as Les comperes Blankety Blank and Opportunity Knocks and displays his full range of comic talents in The Les Dawson Show.","popularity":0.1022,"poster_path":"/dRhoTMCH6WSi9puCWMfYfaujvrQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tribute to the scourge of mother-in-laws, the off-key piano player and all-round, rubber-faced, comic genius","title":"The Best of Les Dawson","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Dawson","original_name":"Les Dawson","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/fTgNgvIBxQuil56koIc0id97Gzy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"613535e76e0d7200435b5f9b","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4930920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2595,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dRhoTMCH6WSi9puCWMfYfaujvrQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
