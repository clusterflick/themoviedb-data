The film is initiated from glazing over on a filmmaking tool. Compare to the real moon, the part-time moon carries an anthropomorphic character: it moves, changes luminosity and color on its own. The camera chases after this organic moon from far to close. It dances, playing hide-and-seek with the camera. The film takes the apparatus usually behind the camera back to the front of the lens, producing a visual-driven narration which is out of the norm.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part-Time Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"파트-타임 문","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li San Kik","original_name":"Li San Kik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61347abacede69008708a8a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
