So why not a \"white film\"? This film includes images, from the oldest Romanesque cloister in Aragon, dating from the 10th century. These are diaphanous images, devoid of temporality and materiality, bordering on visibility. The repetitive and evanescent character is peculiar to a meditative state, to an illumination. The rhythm is that of the metamorphoses of the shapes of the clouds.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film blanc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2122795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","original_name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6134b81afd4a9600445bbf66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
