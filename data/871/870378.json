As the film moves through the house, digital images begin to escape from the forgotten TV and computer screens and materialise into living forms. These forces surge out in utter destruction, invading the domestic realm without restraint. We then hear a narration in Arabic from my grandmother where she describes the burning of sentimental objects in the home before fleeing, and digital fabrications of these objects appear before disintegrating.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fenced within the silent cold walls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"고요하고 차가운 벽 안의 울타리","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bassam Al-Sabah","original_name":"Bassam Al-Sabah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61333f825e1200008714f510","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
