The elder sister Wai-man is genteel and graceful, and the younger sister Wai-ping, taken under the tutelage of Lady Knight Silver Fox, is extrovert, outgoing and gregarious. The drug kingpin Chung Chi-wang has his eyes set on Wai-man but the girl is in love with Ma Kim-leung. Ko Tin-yam, who fearlessly wields his journalistic pen against the gangster, joins forces with his girlfriend Wai-ping to beat off Kong Yau-ming and the thugs dispatched by Chung. The encounter, leads to Kong's recognition of Wai-ping as his flesh and blood entrusted to Cho-sin's care years ago. Wai-ping pleads with her father to turn over a new leaf but fails to save him from Chung's murderous hand. Wai-man and Ma ingratiate themselves with the gangster, who uses the duo to elude the police while transferring drugs to a secluded villa.
