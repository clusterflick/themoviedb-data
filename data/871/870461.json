Witness life in Jaguarland, where a king must be ready to fight to keep his crown, two young brothers hone their skills, and a young female plays cat and mouse with wily rodents. Then see how local ranchers have learned to coexist with jaguars, which once threatened their livelihoods, by establishing ecotourism as a new revenue stream.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/dm5BOzlYR3yP5wMP8xiGKCwl76d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jaguarland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i7kbeCoWAt6GJv7TU614KwLBLkR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dm5BOzlYR3yP5wMP8xiGKCwl76d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
