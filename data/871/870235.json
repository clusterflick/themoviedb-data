Instead of concentrating exclusively on his most famous work, Thomas von Steinaecker sets out to paint a complete picture of Bernstein. Thus, the documentary focusses on the American’s less known later works and on three compositions in particular: his Mass, the musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the great final opera A Quiet Place. The film paints a vivid picture of the multitalented Bernstein, struggling with his role as composer and conductor, tackling the tension between successes and flops, between the politics of his time and his own liberal humanitarian claim. It looks back on Bernstein’s major achievements, such as his acclaimed conducting of Mahler and his involvement in the Young People’s Concerts, and it shows Bernstein’s work with young aspiring musicians as well as his political commitment.","popularity":1.0218,"poster_path":"/wvyUQ7UAaWiHfNUdaRLabBTQUgu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128729,"logo_path":"/nsFlJw9R4yq5YRFr0cIQ6uxPlUS.png","name":"3B-Produktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leonard Bernstein: A Genius Divided","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Leonard Bernstein - Le déchirement d’un génie","type":"arte.fr"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"613278cd2cde98002b616b16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2898469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas von Steinaecker","original_name":"Thomas von Steinaecker","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/8874TgAHTAab0H4X7PucSce2vJI.jpg","credit_id":"613278eee194b000623e232b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2898469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas von Steinaecker","original_name":"Thomas von Steinaecker","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/8874TgAHTAab0H4X7PucSce2vJI.jpg","credit_id":"613278f9a39d0b0065a731fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christoph Valentien","original_name":"Christoph Valentien","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613279271fb94f0043f56969","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1461527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Volker Schaner","original_name":"Volker Schaner","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6132793b924ce50061bbe1d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3221567,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernhard von Hülsen","original_name":"Bernhard von Hülsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6132790fb3f6f5006289e4b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12685032","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/39yraWbORjOtJCK2BTv1UFokH1O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvyUQ7UAaWiHfNUdaRLabBTQUgu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1233,"name":"composer"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":192471,"name":"orchestra conductor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Leonard Bernstein – A Genius Divided","key":"P2DcJWmCNoc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-06-28T10:12:56.000Z","id":"61327b7be3fa2f008f2b8123"}]}}}
