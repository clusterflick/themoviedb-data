But his life of a being without shade soon becomes unbearable; he is stigmatized as a being apart and is the laughing stock of everyone he crosses. Strange story of a being become strange. So he decides to re buy it back but for that will have to sell his soul to the devil. The shadow (black) is a double that never leaves the Being. The white shadow, negative of the previous one, is obtained by means of a china plate with bas-relief motifs and lit by the back. The expression \"White Shadow\" thanks to its poetic power became the title of a film by Flaherty, then the name of a bookstore, which was so flourishing that by consulting google today I could not find the origin of the word.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ombre blanche de l'homme qui marche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2122795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","original_name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6134b75a5e120000439e56aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Light Cone","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
