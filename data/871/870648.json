A Nai firmly believes that he, like the other ducklings, is eager to be able to fly. The super power chip on Ani's body attracts the tracking of the moon people, and it turns out that Ani is a super bomb used by the evil scientists on the moon to destroy the earth's atmosphere. With the coyotes chasing him, Ani and his buddies go south to reunite with the migrating ducks. Despite the danger of the chip explosion, Ani defeats the evil doctor and helps the duck flock to reach the south with love, affection and bravery. Ani also realized his dream: to grow up to be a real flying duck.","popularity":0.0649,"poster_path":"/pKdqlGzIJYlGvcx27TQAbANYNI0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of the Ugly Duckling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6423474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/43YYw9iLzNzGpnFDJ5fQuTOypZk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/pKdqlGzIJYlGvcx27TQAbANYNI0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
