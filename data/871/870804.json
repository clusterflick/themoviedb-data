The lavish resort hotel was perched on a precarious ledge in Greene County for over a century. During its 19th-century heyday, the hotel embodied the peak of luxury for a generation of the rich and famous. But like many resort hotels of the Catskills' glittering past, the Mountain House fell into disuse in the 20th century and was finally destroyed by the state of New York in 1963 to return its scenic overlook to wilderness.  The Catskill Mountain House and The World Around was given the Gold Remi Award by the 44th WorldFest Houston International Film Festival!","popularity":0.6104,"poster_path":"/pfPzXEidhxICihInbg29kVQj14E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Catskill Mountain House and the World Around","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1393429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobe Carey","original_name":"Tobe Carey","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6134e7542cde980044ce0ff9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Vanaver","original_name":"Bill Vanaver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6134e951a806730093ac6ff1","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1739235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfPzXEidhxICihInbg29kVQj14E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":40865,"name":"new york state"},{"id":187249,"name":"catskills"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Catskill Mountain House and The World Around","key":"8uEiqq_0WDc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-10-08T19:19:29.000Z","id":"6134e701b7abb50043e28dd1"}]}}}
