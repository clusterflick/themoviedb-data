The film begins with the heroine's heavy, hungover morning, after a small lonely holiday the day before. The heroine wakes up, with a habitual gesture turns on the old tape recorder with Boyarsky's cassette, dances and tidies up to the music. Suddenly she realizes that she threw something very important and valuable along with the trash. In a panic, she rushes in pursuit of garbage (garbage truck), meeting other heroes along the way. This is a dynamic and fun road movie with intrigue and unusual, lyrical and deep denouement.","popularity":0.2791,"poster_path":"/8Cup5LsBoP8n1zGu8ryr6ln0NbT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing
