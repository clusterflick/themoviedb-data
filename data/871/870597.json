Just before celebrating its 30-year anniversary, the Berlin based Artemis Quartet goes through one of its most turbulent years to date. When the last founding member, cellist Eckart Runge, decides to leave the quartet in 2018, with second violinist Anthea Kreston following his departure, the quartet is shaken to its core. They agree to stay together until the end of the season, giving the remaining members the chance to reconstruct the quartet once more. Will the shared love for music be strong enough for the Artemis Quartet to persevere?  Filmmaker Hester Overmars portrays the quartet, its former and new members, throughout this extraordinary year, having full access to their rehearsals, life behind the scenes and international performances. From up close, the film observes how the quartet lives through their reconstruction.","popularity":0.0969,"poster_path":"/mqi9hkjZ37pYOI8PoCfojDZcBA3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basalt Film","origin_country":""},{"id":72238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tondowski Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For how long will four self-willed individuals be able to subject themselves to the interests of an extremely successful string quartet?","title":"Artemis: The Neverending Quartet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3222772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eckart Runge","original_name":"Eckart Runge","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/pkfx5lLqOLPcMbjQIq9U6DDqgLt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61340cfdfd4a9600445a8e90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregor Sigl","original_name":"Gregor Sigl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61340d1ae93e95002bba5089","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vineta Sareika","original_name":"Vineta Sareika","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61340d371fb94f002ac31381","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthea Kreston","original_name":"Anthea Kreston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61340d4fb7abb50043e12847","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hester Overmars","original_name":"Hester Overmars","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340941d4d509002c5ce683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hester Overmars","original_name":"Hester Overmars","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340a05d4d509002c5ce934","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Cohen","original_name":"Paul Cohen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340a42cede69002a14bd3b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ralf Verbeek","original_name":"Ralf Verbeek","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340bcea39d0b0065aae105","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Wessner","original_name":"Mark Wessner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61340e132cde980089d88136","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11652520","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d2EErlXAf1GEYYMEJoBCF5Onn06.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lR3K1fuO5QUEj9Ldcq5slHjwG80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mqi9hkjZ37pYOI8PoCfojDZcBA3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Artemis: The Neverending Quartet - Trailer","key":"zsLvOmcX5Mw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-29T13:02:53.000Z","id":"613408faa806730063816625"}]}}}
