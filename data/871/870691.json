This schizophrenic condition of an imaginary and non-specific authorial self is caused by self-shaming and guilt of the regrettable past, which can be experienced in the current time where making a mistake is often unforgivable. The image of the endless tunnel from the vision of a person inside of a slide is juxtaposed playfully with the voice. From a perspective of a slider, ‘Limbo’ invites viewers to experience strange yet familiar hyperreality and to blur the concrete state of existence by taking a journey of going through the liquid condition of waterslide.","popularity":0.4336,"poster_path":"/wsp6DgIS006i38xNakDhKL9asZC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limbo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Lam Ka-Tung","original_name":"林家棟","popularity":0.7212,"profile_path":"/61gQoVwgpd4qzovOaZjzJpdm47K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cham Lau","credit_id":"67e11629c2d819df69c75fa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1397017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Yase","original_name":"劉雅瑟","popularity":0.4981,"profile_path":"/2UBsASN6G37pjZtjl0Zse6S74y9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wong To","credit_id":"67e116507d0565af0207e615","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mason Lee","original_name":"Mason Lee","popularity":0.6437,"profile_path":"/zVJfscd1rBPCXOMnsqTmlohCo8i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Will Ren","credit_id":"67e11670c2d819df69c75fb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyuki Ikeuchi","original_name":"池内博之","popularity":1.0564,"profile_path":"/m2uHh24jBPHlRO8cc4gyCCghT5c.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Akira Yamada","credit_id":"67e116a3c2d819df69c75fbc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Sum Chun-Hin","original_name":"Sammy Sum Chun-Hin","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/14JvAGteXhwqciX0uNAwdGaC20K.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Boss Spark","credit_id":"67e116b5978bda8ae24dca2b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fish Liew","original_name":"Fish Liew","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/wouDO99Pw2tCjhRYCbck9qPuGo1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Coco","credit_id":"67e116cf35bd26a7d94dc671","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1879409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Chan","original_name":"Hanna Chan","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/2YnnhzrciSjNSjPXf2KbKv3fPyu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67e116f135bd26a7d94dc67f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumer So","original_name":"Kumer So","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Grizzly","credit_id":"67e11754968ee208674d8201","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Ng Doi-Yung","original_name":"吳岱融","popularity":0.753,"profile_path":"/1FNy7eOKdfjQcKT1aIjv6G0akTs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Chief","credit_id":"67e1176fc2d819df69c75ff2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1957065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Lam","original_name":"Iris Lam","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Cham's wife","credit_id":"67e1178e4ce07d684e07fd75","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soi Cheang","original_name":"鄭保瑞","popularity":0.4258,"profile_path":"/vMHzGQ0p7OovcZ0EPLwFa7lxcSs.jpg","credit_id":"67e11812c2d819df69c7602c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1532,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wsp6DgIS006i38xNakDhKL9asZC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1034}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
