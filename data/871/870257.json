She suffers from multiple sclerosis and is in very bad condition. In a little church on Aegina, according to rumors, supernatural things happen. True miracles. The President of the community is Tasos' father, and so Tasos himself has the chance to experience from up close many remarkable incidents. Bedridden Vera reads the biography of Saint Nektarios, patron saint of the island, whose life we follow in parallel. This strengthens the religious faith of both the heroine and her husband. A new diagnosis, however, changes the facts, and Vera, after a surgical operation, is completely cured.","popularity":0.3088,"poster_path":"/viowhpJFkKuUPWm2mxsa3FPwyCC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saint Nektarios","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christos Politis","original_name":"Χρήστος Πολίτης","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/3hbm7rv7yawJx9yrs0Mf8xUL6HG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61328e6d64f7160042eba859","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Barkoulis","original_name":"Ανδρέας Μπάρκουλης","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/iM6m0UeUzyQHQzRoGlgY6W1satc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61328e71e194b000623e5355","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Krouska","original_name":"Βέρα Κρούσκα","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/nRhfq9bxDSd2QdwtRlsG6Ibkhnq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61328e77cede690087049285","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grigoris Grigoriou","original_name":"Γρηγόρης Γρηγορίου","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/xYzSlYBgDMWCojrh7LpG5Mu7c1D.jpg","credit_id":"61328e39cede69002a117736","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonis David","original_name":"Antonis David","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61328e4415376c0064fdef05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2292893,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kiki Segditsa","original_name":"Κική Σεγδίτσα","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61328e50e3fa2f004308576e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231105","wikidata_id":"Q16326647","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1qX9fKChmXgOATdd6OqRf5bAc5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/viowhpJFkKuUPWm2mxsa3FPwyCC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
