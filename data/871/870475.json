It's home to some very rare species, including the drill -- one of the most endangered primates in the world. Join us on a jungle expedition as we uncover the secret life of these reclusive primates and track down the seasonal migration of the goby -- a plucky fish battling its way upriver past strong currents, deadly predators, and even a 100-foot waterfall, to reach the spawning grounds of its youth.","popularity":0.3228,"poster_path":"/MbmeUSX2UXRz4JRQ2ooAvIL3vJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137140,"logo_path":"/24Gu0QzuDp6umZ3qgnwAru6KiiC.png","name":"The Smithsonian Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monkeys of Bioko","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":992636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Goetzl","original_name":"Oliver Goetzl","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6568e65377c01f012c39b548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/MbmeUSX2UXRz4JRQ2ooAvIL3vJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
