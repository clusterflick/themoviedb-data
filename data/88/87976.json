When he goes to the gas station for a refill, he doesn't even know what a ration book is. The attendant thinks Woody is a wise guy and takes a large mallet and knocks him and his car into a junkyard several miles away. What luck! The old cars still have a bit of gas in them. Woody takes a rubber hose and siphons the gasoline from some of them. Unluckily, one of the cars he picks is brand new. And it's a cop car. Woody is soon at odds with a bulldog police officer.","popularity":0.5004,"poster_path":"/hQFiiX7cNMthQLJrJiG7r7scB6W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ration Bored","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Woody Woodpecker (archive sound)","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc4a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Rogers","original_name":"Kent Rogers","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Woody Woodpecker / Gas station attendant / Police officer","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc4a9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222245,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Emery Hawkins","original_name":"Emery Hawkins","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc483","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milt Schaffer","original_name":"Milt Schaffer","popularity":0.121,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc489","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc48f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc495","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darrell Calker","original_name":"Darrell Calker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc49b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935680,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bob Bentley","original_name":"Bob Bentley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc4a1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152145","wikidata_id":"Q7295743","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pLxnTshRbgxoqjBKJpSPqYb4R4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hQFiiX7cNMthQLJrJiG7r7scB6W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gCNdDtucHUrBNojEgfdznCI59Pa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3lgn9cemzDhHOzFooWlLHsZfdIY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":169215,"name":"gas rationing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
