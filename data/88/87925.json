Aboard the train are a pair of pickpockets, a honeymoon couple, a drunk, a temperance pamphleteer and a host of familiar types, all more-or-less bizarre in characteristically English ways. Bob takes an unexpected course of action, and the characters start interacting in varied and unexpected ways. When, at last, the train stops, all has been resolved, but not as might have been expected at the beginning of the journey.","popularity":0.7516,"poster_path":"/44kMos5j4V2TDDlPndCOpHMForG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Julius Hagen
