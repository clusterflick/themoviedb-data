The town is dominated by a group of Klansmen who keep the Black majority from voting or being treated like human beings. However, these newcomers convince the local population to register to vote so they can take back power and achieve justice. When hundreds show up to register, the Klan responds with violence. Eventually, though, the Black community has little choice other than fight back and the film ends with a small war between these combat vets and the Klan.","popularity":1.0929,"poster_path":"/6sc156Zlu477KMKZGUqF3gHZtLe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61949,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Film Consortium","origin_country":""},{"id":61950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bellwether Films","origin_country":""},{"id":61951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berwether Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch the brothers stick it to the Klan!","title":"Brotherhood of Death","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Jefferson","original_name":"Roy Jefferson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Raymond Moffat","credit_id":"52fe49d69251416c910ba5b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Le Tari","original_name":"Le Tari","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/a7Sxb4p7A6wdzgipyBwTJRa56Ow.jpg","cast_id":43,"character":"Ned Tiese","credit_id":"66ee5cd8d4a8ac49678d0e4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haskell V.
