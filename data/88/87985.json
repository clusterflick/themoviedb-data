Suckling serves as host of the movie, guiding viewers through this journey across Cuba.  Suckling has been traveling to Cuba regularly since the early 1990s, first as European Editor of Cigar Aficionado magazine, and now with his own website, www.jamessuckling.com. He has visited the tobacco plantations, sorting houses, factories, and cigar shops hundreds of times over two decades, but in “Cigars: The Heart And Soul Of Cuba,” he aims to discover why Cuban cigars are the best in the world – and he does.  The documentary has already garnered much praise from premiering to select audiences in Cuba, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, and China, and is now available for purchase online worldwide.","popularity":0.2666,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cigars: The Heart & Soul of Cuba","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zigarren: Das Herz und die Seele von Kuba","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2776272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":701,"name":"cuba"},{"id":11333,"name":"cigar smoking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer for \"Cigars: The Heart And Soul Of Cuba\"","key":"ZiXM8TkoV3I","published_at":"2011-10-20T21:42:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d4c3a3685448007c33"}]}}}
