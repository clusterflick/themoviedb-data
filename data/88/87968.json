Gruber intends to get his robbery loot, which his father, Curly, has successfully hidden from the law.  After commandeering a plane, they double-cross Graham, who assembles his gang to get revenge - and Gruber's loot. Meanwhile, Gilbert falls in love with Robbie, his ex-wife’s sister. Through Robbie’s influence, Gilbert decides to go straight, but his cohorts aren’t quite so willing to reform.","popularity":1.182,"poster_path":"/rq2HNzbf2QERRtMcBTEnTcyMWAI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clover Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Inside Story Behind the Most Amazing Crash-Out in Crime Annals!","title":"Escape from San Quentin","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Desmond","original_name":"Johnny Desmond","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/jL39Uw7Fcb682quK9ptTXxVOEil.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mike Gilbert","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc453","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Devon","original_name":"Richard Devon","popularity":0.7135,"profile_path":"/oooqOm2eA20BIqjDFpez2di4GYT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Roy Gruber","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc45b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Engel","original_name":"Roy Engel","popularity":0.4108,"profile_path":"/i5AvkOVO5LhU8JNjWO6BAg9CowG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hap","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc45f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Christy","original_name":"Ken Christy","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Curly Gruber","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc467","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bryant","original_name":"William Bryant","popularity":0.3357,"profile_path":"/vbUtH9pWQKVppFELxkqV2YN3kVA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Richie","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc463","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merry Anders","original_name":"Merry Anders","popularity":0.3807,"profile_path":"/u7T7EjQneRuBO8gUVZH6Hd8nR5w.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Robbie","credit_id":"52fe49e49251416c910bc457","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry J.
