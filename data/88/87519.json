Instead, they play inside their van outside the club to stunned bystanders. Nate (drums), Josh (guitar), Jen (their lighting girl) and three dogs don't think twice about travelling hundreds of miles across the country to play one 15-minute show in a loading zone. Friends Forever (the documentary) captures their smoke-spewing, generator-powered rock world, and the tour that has them crisscrossing the U.S. in search of the perfect parking spot. No audience is too small, or too baffled, to skimp on the performance when you're on \"a mission to save rock.\"","popularity":0.5656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friends Forever","video":false,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Hayden","original_name":"Nate Hayden","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63fc2081e4b576009d1b633d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Taylor","original_name":"Josh Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63fc209e96e30b009fca6719","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenn Keyser","original_name":"Jenn Keyser","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63fc20bde4b576009d1b635f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5159907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Fantastic","original_name":"Amy Fantastic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"677a4c9455d4b38f9366e0e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Kaufman","original_name":"Lloyd Kaufman","popularity":0.5372,"profile_path":"/4jNIqeZBK2YbpPupBhl4l1moQn5.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"677a4c9f816b2810d166de55","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","original_name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49cc9251416c910b908d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","original_name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbcb7a96e30b00be5a3526","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","original_name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbcb8e96e30b007bd1653f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940932,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George Gross","original_name":"George Gross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc1f220c125500a70b811b","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940931,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Debby Wolfinsohn","original_name":"Debby Wolfinsohn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc1ef496e30b00dd70f712","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","original_name":"Ben Wolfinsohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc1ea70c1255007b6aa0c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940930,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bret Berg","original_name":"Bret Berg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc1ecf0c1255007b6aa0dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0359297","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197340,"name":"diy"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"friends forever a documentary film clip [trailer]","key":"NDY1AypdgtA","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2006-11-12T01:56:23.000Z","id":"63fbc8380c125500a70b55a9"}]}}}
