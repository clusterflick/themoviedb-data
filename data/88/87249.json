He tries to get a loan on it from a nearby wolf. The wolf agrees to give Woody the loan but exclaims if he doesn't receive payment in thirty days, he'll take Woody's car away. Sure enough, a title card tells us, \"Thirty days have elapsed (and so has Woody's memory)\". The wolf appears at Woody's door trying to serve him with a notice but the crafty woodpecker pretends he's not home. The wolf tries to trap him disguised as a deliveryman giving Woody a cake... but the woodpecker throws it in his face bellowing, \"I don't like cheesecake!\" Finally, the fox throws a punch at Woody and believes to have seriously injured him. He sympathetically agrees to forget about the loan only to be infuriated when Woody \"recovers\" holding a cuckoo clock and asking, \"How about a loan on the clock, Doc?\"","popularity":0.7411,"poster_path":"/80wiWeROCCVTNqPCQOjkCcyIiVS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Loan Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Woody Woodpecker (archive sound)","credit_id":"52fe49bb9251416c910b6f7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Rogers","original_name":"Kent Rogers","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Woody Woodpecker","credit_id":"52fe49bb9251416c910b6f83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Peary","original_name":"Harold Peary","popularity":0.2091,"profile_path":"/zh1IOcd813geZzUVJcWngUZGgQM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hudson C.
