Helping his father farm is all he really knows. This makes things difficult when his kin fights for the Union Army, as well as the Rebel cause. He doesn't know who what to do. Should he fight for the Yankees, the Rebs, or just continue working on the farm? He has a cousin who is a deserter which he helps with food and a blanket; this is a crime not taken lightly. He writes Abraham Lincoln for advice on the matter. The president responds in a letter which guides him some, but more or less provides him with comfort; when a nine year old is in the midst of war, what is more important?","popularity":0.5232,"poster_path":"/7cixjaGV8C7FkLlTjoy6lo9mr3b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Family Channel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A personal quest turns a young boy into a man.","title":"Across Five Aprils","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Duffey","original_name":"Todd Duffey","popularity":0.1255,"profile_path":"/lzrStdkGxc6cFOYR2JFuv9pnJeH.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Jethro Creighton","credit_id":"621ffdede194b0001b74cda7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Byrd-Nethery","original_name":"Miriam Byrd-Nethery","popularity":0.1614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Ellen Creighton","credit_id":"621ffdfa41aac4006c6da6eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3450300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Touchstone","original_name":"John Touchstone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Matt Creighton","credit_id":"621ffe098a88b2001c716945","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1273060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hollis McCarthy","original_name":"Hollis McCarthy","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/mhB5TSKxJlMhec4Rf85H5mBg2Vw.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Jenny Creighton","credit_id":"621ffe16902012006d458170","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2538669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Cochran","original_name":"Patrick Cochran","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/lAFeqzc5CX0aSwDtppw5LSB2h0o.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Bill Creighton","credit_id":"621ffe25902012006d4581b6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3450299,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irene Hunt","original_name":"Irene Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ffdc7e194b0004446242a","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Meyer","original_name":"Kevin Meyer","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ffd696c449c00450d8a35","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Meyer","original_name":"Kevin Meyer","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49df9251416c910bba3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0099275","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7cixjaGV8C7FkLlTjoy6lo9mr3b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
