Soon they fall in love. It's a very passionate relationship, but this leads to problems. Both of them are very strong in their opinions, and both are behaving a little strange. Love turns to hate, and instead of doing all they can to please each other, they do all they can to hurt the other person psychological. They both do a great job, and what began as a love story turns into a sad and depressing story of two ruined persons. The story is told by Thomas Glahn from his \"exile\" in Thailand, where he in the beginning of the movie receives two green feathers from Edvarda.","popularity":0.2879,"poster_path":"/3yGUJijeTO7vEoFOKHHHCnsYlYv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagmar Film Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":150154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Multimedia Hamburg","origin_country":""},{"id":5403,"logo_path":"/fAz2WhTpoMxutBA92JqlfeHEGuz.png","name":"Nordisk Film & TV Fond","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":150155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK)","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":6431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northern Lights","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":150156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schibsted Film","origin_country":""},{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1995-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pan","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lasse Kolsrud","original_name":"Lasse Kolsrud","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/epedeQNoyJ9BZ2F3L3gWrifpkF1.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Lt.
