May 1945. The children do not know where their parents are. In the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, they now live next to English soldiers and broken concentration camp inmates. They find shelter in the villa of the Jewish Warburg family in Hamburg-Blankenese. From Hell to Paradise. Anti-Semitism in post-war Germany is catching up with children and educators - hostility in the zoo, disregard in the local hospital. The children are waiting impatiently for the long journey to their new home in Palestine.","popularity":0.2204,"poster_path":"/Yrg6UHhdTH6vrm8a39U2Ic0pME.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Kinder von Blankenese","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Dwyer","original_name":"Alice Dwyer","popularity":0.3626,"profile_path":"/z1GOYuaaYHlEv1s1td3c8S8CxCu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Betty Adler","credit_id":"547d04129251412d6d003cf7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janek Rieke","original_name":"Janek Rieke","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/8dWgSDFEAbkPmzoDVphRoHXavCq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eric Warburg","credit_id":"547d0425c3a3685b00004301","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Schrott","original_name":"Harald Schrott","popularity":0.2359,"profile_path":"/eiwhK2Fao3aSw2NYwnPbTCm85gm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben Yehuda","credit_id":"547d04379251412d75003760","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Ley","original_name":"Hannah Ley","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/773W8EU1lfVXDuIrXbyiWNKdjIY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rahel Tschinsky","credit_id":"547d044cc3a36841e1000a4c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Ulrich","original_name":"Jennifer Ulrich","popularity":0.349,"profile_path":"/3I8JS27pZ2l06VRXcANm93xcQRa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Reuma Weizman","credit_id":"547d045d9251412d78003d35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1397749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Altaras","original_name":"Aaron Altaras","popularity":0.3397,"profile_path":"/n23EIdM8qJRNEMqudL1Sb0vnRAP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3b8375ca70400c6e06953","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Altaras","original_name":"Leo Altaras","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":"/nAHqtFTjhrdEYbgaflLlFognpTQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3b8411283e900c6f033ea","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jannik Schümann","original_name":"Jannik Schümann","popularity":1.1816,"profile_path":"/qKh7JAht5TkX6O8anAxDWEHzuh2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3b8461283e9007c331f94","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Nitschkoff","original_name":"Julius Nitschkoff","popularity":0.2449,"profile_path":"/m1SipE5OZT6sEQQdGn7t0433DCc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63e3b857fac50200849f2cda","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Ley","original_name":"Raymond Ley","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/bUMvljMrREd8O9VfzV20WTjKWQw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49b09251416c910b5827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1639454","wikidata_id":"Q1213848","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jilRROmuoBNWyliLg2oOTSp55iK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/Yrg6UHhdTH6vrm8a39U2Ic0pME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
