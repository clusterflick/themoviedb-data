A bit of an odd character, Triangle Woman has kept these stories locked up in her head for many years. The film includes stories about a man whose finger rapidly deteriorates and the impending consequences; a nice lady who really isn't that nice; an old woman who talks backwards; an employment agency that has a man-toy named Mr. Brombellarella; among other stories. Triangle Woman is the thread that binds all of the stories together, and she imprints her bizarreness throughout the entire film.","popularity":0.2091,"poster_path":"/tIJmXhuwMFVb3G8lNU2ETda6OJP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Many Strange Stories Of Triangle Woman","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Jimenez Hall","original_name":"Vivian Jimenez Hall","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Triangle Woman","credit_id":"52fe49bc9251416c910b70e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard D.
