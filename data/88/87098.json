During the Soviet rule artists who stay true to their vision are executed, sent to mental hospitals or Gulags.  Their plight inspires young Igor Savitsky. He pretends to buy state-approved art but instead daringly rescues 40,000 forbidden fellow artist's works and creates a museum in the desert of Uzbekistan, far from the watchful eyes of the KGB. Though a penniless artist himself, he cajoles the cash to pay for the art from the same authorities who are banning it. Savitsky amasses an eclectic mix of Russian Avant-Garde art. But his greatest discovery is an unknown school of artists who settle in Uzbekistan after the Russian revolution of 1917, encountering a unique Islamic culture, as exotic to them as Tahiti was for Gauguin. They develop a startlingly original style, fusing European modernism with centuries-old Eastern traditions.","popularity":0.8245,"poster_path":"/5PVaDqM5rSdVWmej8Kp0Sa52z8n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Desert of Forbidden Art","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Asner","original_name":"Ed Asner","popularity":1.4062,"profile_path":"/uj5TQBVb1jdPrvSEdwjzT6DRmqi.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"54564d070e0a265278000b0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Field","original_name":"Sally Field","popularity":1.8968,"profile_path":"/5fBK36MdmdwQQMuP0W70rXADXih.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b632f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Kingsley","original_name":"Ben Kingsley","popularity":3.4493,"profile_path":"/vQtBqpF2HDdzbfXHDzR4u37i1Ac.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6333","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amanda Pope","original_name":"Amanda Pope","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6357","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","original_name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b636f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miriam Cutler","original_name":"Miriam Cutler","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/8wBHwtn6IIU6jwRoZ6lGEBiHGPu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b634b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","original_name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b633f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amanda Pope","original_name":"Amanda Pope","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b635d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amanda Pope","original_name":"Amanda Pope","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6339","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934896,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexandr Dolgin","original_name":"Alexandr Dolgin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6351","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","original_name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6369","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","original_name":"Tchavdar Georgiev","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6363","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":492385,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gennadi Balitski","original_name":"Gennadi Balitski","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49b59251416c910b6345","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1536458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5PVaDqM5rSdVWmej8Kp0Sa52z8n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2598,"name":"museum"},{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
