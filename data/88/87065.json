As beguiling a raconteur as he is a performer, Louie makes for a wildly entertaining movie subject, and Zwigoff honors him with an unsentimental but endlessly affectionate tribute. Full of infectious music and comedy, Louie Bluie is a humane evocation of the kind of pop-cultural marginalia that Zwigoff would continue to excavate in the coming years.","popularity":0.4241,"poster_path":"/4pdAoyw04eXprKh0mpGvAomS3KC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Superior","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Filmed at the 1985 Friscofest","title":"Louie Bluie","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Armstrong","original_name":"Howard Armstrong","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7fca411d6c5f00141bb703","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Bogan","original_name":"Ted Bogan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7fca52fbe36f001308dffa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Lynch","original_name":"Jay Lynch","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7fca5ffbe36f001708c937","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2582147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yank Rachell","original_name":"Yank Rachell","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7fca929a358d0015c60279","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ikey Robinson","original_name":"Ikey Robinson","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7fcaa7a127e50016552d44","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Zwigoff","original_name":"Terry Zwigoff","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/6ZV5ASRdwD2qnRr2ngylm7AbXoi.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49b19251416c910b598d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9213,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Myers","original_name":"David Myers","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/Ah4gtSxGZNDampCyKti0iDOGwkD.jpg","credit_id":"65721f57f288380139ad72ae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1934438,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Victoria Lewis","original_name":"Victoria Lewis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7fcb029a358d0013c5fde1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Zwigoff","original_name":"Terry Zwigoff","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/6ZV5ASRdwD2qnRr2ngylm7AbXoi.jpg","credit_id":"5e7fcb199a358d0018c60b33","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Simeone","original_name":"Frank Simeone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7fcc7ca4f03c0012b56896","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582150,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christopher Li","original_name":"Christopher Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7fcc060f0da500146e40fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0089507","wikidata_id":"Q4268344","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qFRbqhlQdYvxQGcl82M2wqDsMv0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1650,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4pdAoyw04eXprKh0mpGvAomS3KC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1100},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uYEyTEG396DYJg9yidsIBU2S9Ia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago International Film Festival","release_date":"1985-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York City, New York","release_date":"1985-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LOUIE BLUIE Clip (1985) - The Criterion Collection","key":"1lSMw4jOPxA","published_at":"2010-05-24T16:02:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"533ec6d3c3a3685448007b82"}]}}}
