By following three activists, one is taken on a rough trip in the slums and villages of Kanpur region, where these characters are determined to continue spreading the revolutionary messages of Ambedkar, come what may despite the backlash, and in a creative way. It is an emotional journey into the urge to struggle in order to assert one's humanity, when humiliation, exploitation and violence remain always around the corner.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qhUR3xTtCPM9RakvgCFzsIqxu17.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SANGHARSH (TIMES OF STRIFE)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Jaoul","original_name":"Nicolas Jaoul","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb50990c3514c00205780a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Jaoul","original_name":"Nicolas Jaoul","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb509a0cc277c002168c905","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Jaoul","original_name":"Nicolas Jaoul","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb50997cc277c002067d9ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2629625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Huguet","original_name":"Thomas Huguet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb509e0e375c00020fc1298","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167483,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gilles Volta","original_name":"Gilles Volta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb509b40cb3350021c96e2a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629623,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vismay Chintan","original_name":"Vismay Chintan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb509c3e375c00021fb50b9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Santosh Jha","original_name":"Santosh Jha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb509cd7ac829002022bb7e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhUR3xTtCPM9RakvgCFzsIqxu17.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Asian Festival Premiere","release_date":"2018-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SANGHARSH.
