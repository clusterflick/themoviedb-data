The one and only thing that still exists is the gravity; things do not fall apart.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/p6mZUoz97E0iZwi1mBS7W3vXIXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132155,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Onassis Foundation","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abigail Browde","original_name":"Abigail Browde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb360e4f3e0df001e29e152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Silverstone","original_name":"Michael Silverstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb360f0ccb15f002283eb04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abigail Browde","original_name":"Abigail Browde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb368660cb3350020c76ef1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Silverstone","original_name":"Michael Silverstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3687466469a001be17785","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p6mZUoz97E0iZwi1mBS7W3vXIXu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8uf0QIAMqSHHTAvmMUrSsaM25.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
