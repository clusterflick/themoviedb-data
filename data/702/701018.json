The bridge and the cutter were lost on a long-standing enmity that continued and deepened day after day. But the cause of enmity is unknown and has nothing to do with the crucifixion of the story. In the past, the two communities gathered a relationship of friendship and love until a mysterious grudge came and separated them, making them one of the deadliest enemies. The estate of the bridge cut off the course of water heading towards the cutter's estate, causing its lands to dry up and destroy its crops. A state of explosive hatred and boiling prevailed between the two villages for a long time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/b2RGd0Jy9DuEbuTDKo4DfhVDL84.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"جسر القمر","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b2RGd0Jy9DuEbuTDKo4DfhVDL84.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
