How to do it preserving the intentionality of the gestus in an ambiguous andsubjective space where the individualism of the artistic perspective is set.  “my maladresse…” proposes a viewpoint over Ana Jotta’s universe. An analogous portrait of her relations as an artist is created, setting parallel questions, as hermeneutics possibility and art as a value system. The link relating the trio (artist and director’s deuce) balances between familiarity, master and apprentice, subject and object; the distance and authority of the one behind the camera spreading light around artisticurgencies concerning how Work and Life overlay in this unquiet chase of the greater purpose: a search for consolation in the holy_burlesque of existential functionalism.  A documental laboratory of reflexive limits.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/4XVvk7fo3NvYSlqmTc7noP6zmZW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":23725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jotta: a minha maladresse é uma forma de délicatesse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2252710,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ana Jotta","original_name":"Ana Jotta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb59ac7c3514c001f5634c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Cabral Martins","original_name":"Fernando Cabral Martins","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb5f69a0cb3350021ca90a1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francisco Moreira","original_name":"Francisco Moreira","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a1cb3b8ddc3414969cf408","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francisco Moreira","original_name":"Francisco Moreira","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a1cb4051f99a0089597eda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salomé Lamas","original_name":"Salomé Lamas","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/AnHUcBUlttHojpeGvPbHKs2XcnU.jpg","credit_id":"5eb5999ccc277c0020689923","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salomé Lamas","original_name":"Salomé Lamas","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/AnHUcBUlttHojpeGvPbHKs2XcnU.jpg","credit_id":"5eb599e2ccb15f002286f278","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Cunha Ferreira","original_name":"Joana Cunha Ferreira","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb59a06ccb15f002088633b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183164,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tiago Matos","original_name":"Tiago Matos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb59a76cc277c002169dd04","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1548884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graça Castanheira","original_name":"Graça Castanheira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6cd4f9979d20020313767","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13660652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.631,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XVvk7fo3NvYSlqmTc7noP6zmZW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":505}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
