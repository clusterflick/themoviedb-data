Footage collected from disparate locations—a university herbarium, karst sinkholes inhabited by primordial flora and fauna, a telecommunication tower job site, a decaying grain silo, among others—interlocks to evoke a narrative of present danger and future disaster, of plant expansion and humanity's retreat. The film rejects the human individual as the focus of narrative cinema, and, instead, adopts the perspective of a symbiotic \"implosive whole\" in which human and nonhumans are related in an overlapping, non-total way.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/kyXUwnzcBaB5aIzinl8ucjDp644.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Field Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2628933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Drummer","original_name":"Emily Drummer","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43132cc277c00216740ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2628933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Drummer","original_name":"Emily Drummer","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f92e1609020120037fb6789","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2628933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Drummer","original_name":"Emily Drummer","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f92e1683d35570033d72f16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2628933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Drummer","original_name":"Emily Drummer","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f92e1a29020120036fc32f7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2780092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Rabalais","original_name":"Philip Rabalais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f92e1b33d35570033d72f9e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827186,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Peder Goodman","original_name":"Peder Goodman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f92e1cb9020120035fd6130","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2628933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Drummer","original_name":"Emily Drummer","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f92e1ee9020120036fc3393","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyXUwnzcBaB5aIzinl8ucjDp644.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"dafilms.cz (as part of Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival)","release_date":"2020-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica","release_date":"2020-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milwaukee Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moviate Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Field Resistance [Trailer]","key":"UnXPF9g3ZMo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-06T16:00:10.000Z","id":"5f731eff435abd003a09a650"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"(Excerpt) Field Resistance (2019)","key":"327740531","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-01T15:07:30.000Z","id":"5f731f0bd38b580038ebe802"}]}}}
