In 'The Garden of Delight' beauty and evil go together like in a dream. We dive into a world of erotic derangement, inhabited by dancing lovers, lustful mutated baboons, tropical birds, deformed pin-ups, butterflies and body-builders. This hand-manipulated collage film, made entirely out of 35 and 8mm found-footage, explores the marriage between heaven and hell, our irresolvable endless conflict that goes with human nature. Inspired on the triptych 'The Garden of Delight' by Jheronimus Bosch.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/cz73ZVek5BEjpQswpVRAoaP9Bw0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Garden of Delight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2508046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Fleming","original_name":"Michael Fleming","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb6854dfd7aa4001c5c8634","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1805658,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Michael Smith","original_name":"Aaron Michael Smith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb68901ca7ec6001e7a1d7e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13591142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7ssZ6ibsFEYVWunazrKV3H2yWt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cz73ZVek5BEjpQswpVRAoaP9Bw0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2017-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Istanbul International Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2020-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
