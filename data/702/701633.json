It aims to show the thin line between harmless faith and the kind that puts down human dignity in the name of religion. Starting with a Godman with questionable intent, it moves on to a place where women are segregated during their periods, a lady isn't allowed to enter her place of worship for being born into a specific caste, and finally to a dargah where mentally ill women are admitted for being cured of their demons.","popularity":0.2948,"poster_path":"/hOuYXDfE0SHcqkB0pWMm19cN8r2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OUR GODS ARE LIKE THAT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2629851,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sraiyanti","original_name":"Sraiyanti","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb54668e375c00021fb895d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2629851,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sraiyanti","original_name":"Sraiyanti","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5469dcc277c001f6736f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Subhankar Chakraborty","original_name":"Subhankar Chakraborty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb54684c3514c00205802c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629857,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rolla Das","original_name":"Rolla Das","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb546927ac829002122a3fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629858,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Badhri Narayanan Seshadri","original_name":"Badhri Narayanan Seshadri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb546a80cb3350021c9c75d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hOuYXDfE0SHcqkB0pWMm19cN8r2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":934}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":180492,"name":"caste system"},{"id":183987,"name":"orthodox"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NAM DEVARU AATHARA (2019) Trailer #1","key":"BWPmjy5JoFI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-14T11:15:01.000Z","id":"5eb54704cc277c0020683526"}]}}}
