Here Harry meets the beautiful Nancy Potter when he defends her against the drunken advances of Silas Jones, her father's friend. Although his daughter believes that he is a fisherman, Cail Potter is actually a thief, robbing houses along the coast with Silas as his accomplice. When Cail robs the wealthy Col. Brett's home, he finds an old miniature of a woman who exactly resembles Nancy, whom Cail rescued from a wrecked boat when she was just a year old. Soon after the robbery, Harry learns that the police are about to raid Cail's house, but Silas knocks him unconscious when he attempts to warn Nancy.","popularity":0.2336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea Waif","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1817797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Huff","original_name":"Louise Huff","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/bwiPE5BqqYW4DFNdiVnMc1UpBnr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nancy Potter","credit_id":"5eb378f366469a001be18b4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bowers","original_name":"John Bowers","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/j6KhoMBcaddOHhyuHjXIUxAyjzP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harry Caton","credit_id":"5eb378fa0cb335001fc737c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Broderick","original_name":"Robert Broderick","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/ysQzxckJ5fAO88TVwmk5BDDvnYS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cail Potter","credit_id":"5eb379130cb3350021c760f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Clement","original_name":"Clay Clement","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/IE33z6hzwKvwjdpmiHvRSU7Mbr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Silas Jones","credit_id":"6287d7f20d5d853e86bfd106","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3199010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Malone","original_name":"Florence Malone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7qxKfqeMsunWVeBXnu3BfKnHL0y.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Chester","credit_id":"6287d8000d5d853e87f6e921","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Merlo","original_name":"Tony Merlo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Phil Warren","credit_id":"5eb3790066469a001ce1a43d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Warwick","original_name":"Henry Warwick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Colonel Brett","credit_id":"5eb3790d66469a001de1e850","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Reinhard","original_name":"Louis Reinhard","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Rankin","credit_id":"6287d810ec455274c28728c1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
