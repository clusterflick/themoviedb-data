On the phone, Tomás agrees to see his new girlfriend that evening, so he begs off study when Pablo arrives to work on their joint architecture thesis. Before Pablo leaves, Tomás discovers a vial of pills: AZT. Tomas presses Pablo, who admits he is HIV-positive. Tomás throws a fit: how could Pablo be so selfish as to expose him to AIDS!
