From a photograph of his childhood, Luis Eduardo Aute glances back to discover what remains in him of those eyes of a child with which he looked at the sea. With the battle of Manila as the setting, a bloody contest that claimed the lives of more than a hundred thousand people, the author remembers the boy who was and how, from that tragic experience, the figure of the basilisk began to stalk him, a being mythological in the form of a winged serpent capable of killing with its eyes, representing the adult world, degradation and death.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/1k1sLpxyLUtWzZQWPWb89x7e9bH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El niño y el Basilisco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061982,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luis Eduardo Aute","original_name":"Luis Eduardo Aute","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/p8ePPx4p4av4HDLGzwGNB8wM0wB.jpg","credit_id":"5eb2c1b0f74f5f001e95ff29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1515,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1k1sLpxyLUtWzZQWPWb89x7e9bH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
