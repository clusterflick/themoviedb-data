A fast paced collage creates an in-the-moment narrative of how the war was won and lost. Hitlerboy Dirk and Goebbels watch their world implode, while Alice fears for her children in Auschwitz and Russian soldier Victor walks through the plundered Chancellery. When it’s all over, Germans learn democracy and socialism. Giving voice to Soviet, US, UK and French soldiers as well as to the German population anxiously awaiting the outcome of the fighting. BERLIN 1945 creates an innovative, comprehensive narrative of how the war was won and lost, how the city was liberated and how it emerged from the rubble.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":"/q5lULXB10V8fRGigYGJ6iZRJDHx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16844,"logo_path":"/wy2JQsrqBGhDBg8d57SGIrZtMAh.png","name":"Zero One Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":36996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bauderfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin 1945: Diary of a Metropolis","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Berlin 1945 : le journal d'une capitale","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Berlin 1945","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345869,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Janine Dauterich","original_name":"Janine Dauterich","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f7fe375c00020fc5c5b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2101363,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Volker Heise","original_name":"Volker Heise","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f37ccb15f0020879666","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1981563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Heußner","original_name":"Sven Heußner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f8f0cb335001fc8ca1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2101363,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Volker Heise","original_name":"Volker Heise","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f2fcc277c00216910bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ulrike Haage","original_name":"Ulrike Haage","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f63ccb15f0022865a2c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68001,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Kufus","original_name":"Thomas Kufus","popularity":0.1287,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52fad7ac8290022237714","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5136,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Bird","original_name":"Andrew Bird","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f730cb3350020cae6e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Bauder","original_name":"Marc Bauder","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb52f9fcc277c0020680d48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12264166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nzWyyoIgpFZxEhPiisfHSz2pAzI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1475,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1QfcY0Xqj6uyW8REb3p0A9i3Sko.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":983},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7TFc75nZZroTB8yYe6LfYQYwvyf.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/4DTlByP3IDGqcckT6cR7UoQnjqB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q5lULXB10V8fRGigYGJ6iZRJDHx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"ARTE en 2 parties","release_date":"2020-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Berlin 1945: Trailer | BBC Trailers","key":"L78Ko55NqnI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-10-23T17:00:03.000Z","id":"64a9479a9c97bd00c5f78ca4"}]}}}
