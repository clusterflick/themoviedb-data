Her days are divided by the several chores imposed by household keeping: floor-washing, bathroom cleaning, doing the laundry. This is the story of a housewife who wished to fly faraway but didn’t, perhaps, as she puts it, because she was born “before time”. She goes through the daily routine with all she has left: memories and songs from another time, from a revolution (April, 1974), that fill in the soundtrack of her world and of her days.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":23725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evening Star","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madalena Miranda","original_name":"Madalena Miranda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb542d6e375c00022fbee7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madalena Miranda","original_name":"Madalena Miranda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb542dae375c00022fbee89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madalena Miranda","original_name":"Madalena Miranda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb542eecc277c0020682e66","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865237,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tiago Antunes","original_name":"Tiago Antunes","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb542fa0cb3350021c9bbe7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1541869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Godinho","original_name":"André Godinho","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/79nme6Mhp9L4uPM6xc658bBWKC6.jpg","credit_id":"5eb5430de375c00022fbeec0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1891386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joana Frazão","original_name":"Joana Frazão","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb54317c3514c001f55de12","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629829,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marta Lima","original_name":"Marta Lima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb543277ac829002223a3b4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
