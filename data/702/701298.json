The film employs several codes of conflict and discord—from the territorial border of India and Pakistan to visuals of Tibetan refugee settlement— to satiate the curiosity to posit violence as a credible response to hurt and harm. It questions its worthiness as device to exact revenge on the transgressor.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/i8wPjjL5UYvABxXSTlaokjCvNbS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1997-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Season Outside","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amar Kanwar","original_name":"Amar Kanwar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3e0acc3514c00205559d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0205387","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i8wPjjL5UYvABxXSTlaokjCvNbS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1097,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/libFRiLSurwcgKnKATeaMIE8bo1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":732}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"youtube","release_date":"2017-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
