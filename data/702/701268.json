In a departure from the detached quality of black-and-white archival footage, Gour offers a hopeful imagination of Singapore then and showcases his playful infatuation with its urban environment.  A 4K restoration of Sunshine Singapore was made possible using the surviving 16mm film print preserved by the Asian Film Archive and restored by Cineric Inc. in 2018.\"  (Asian Film Archive)","popularity":0.0498,"poster_path":"/rnAfEaeVpYXLjVouHCxA9cxUzbW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film captures the hopes of the young filmmaker, the beauty of a young nation, tempered by the familiarity of daily life.","title":"Sunshine Singapore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajendra Gour","original_name":"Rajendra Gour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3abb8c3514c002054efcb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajendra Gour","original_name":"Rajendra Gour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3abceccb15f002084ad60","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajendra Gour","original_name":"Rajendra Gour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3aba3cc277c0021663e59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1790,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnAfEaeVpYXLjVouHCxA9cxUzbW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1193}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"-","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
