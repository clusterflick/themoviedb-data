From leaving families and loved ones to fighting on the battlefield and risking lives, nearly each personal facet is explored and discussed in Lee’s powerful testament.  This film was probably either inspired by, or the inspiration for, Samuel Cummins' production of the same title (q.v.)","popularity":0.2085,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Men: The War as It Was","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sir John Hammerton","original_name":"Sir John Hammerton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Interviewer-Commentator","credit_id":"5f0397e98a0e9b00359a0d8d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Lee","original_name":"Norman Lee","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/c9ufnSACMgO4lOkfKjthkl2lykS.jpg","credit_id":"5eb3de43cc277c002166a7e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Lee","original_name":"Norman Lee","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/c9ufnSACMgO4lOkfKjthkl2lykS.jpg","credit_id":"5f03983ba097dc0036c49e1e","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Black Jr.","original_name":"George Black Jr.","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f03990c53f83300379f9b32","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553848,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"A.C.
