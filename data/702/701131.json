The original idea came from Levi, a Hungarian film student, who went to Madrid for 5 months to study, and after finishing school there, he decided to go back to Budapest on his fixie bike and asked the people of Europe to join him on his way. The journey started in July, at the European Cycle Messenger Championship, Madrid and ended at the gates of Sziget Festival, Budapest in August. Friends from film schools of Budapest, Madrid and London joined the trip to make a road-movie about the challenges and most of all the fun that Levi and the other riders had on the way to Budapest.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/a414uzbKlgyoHCy19q5oMNu0K6q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2012-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycle Me Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levente Klára","original_name":"Levente Klára","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb30856fbe36f0023c475bc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dániel Vérten","original_name":"Dániel Vérten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb308631089ba001e36d350","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627879,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Máté Pálla","original_name":"Máté Pálla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3087bbf0f63001f80987e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2627880,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Júlia Hack","original_name":"Júlia Hack","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3088365e0a2002641e635","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":889,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a414uzbKlgyoHCy19q5oMNu0K6q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
