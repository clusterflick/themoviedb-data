Unist’ot’en Camp, Gidimt’en checkpoint and the larger Wet’suwet’en Nation are standing up to the Canadian government and corporations who continue colonial violence against Indigenous people. The Unist’ot’en Camp has been a beacon of resistance for nearly 10 years. It is a healing space for Indigenous people and settlers alike, and an active example of decolonization. The violence, environmental destruction, and disregard for human rights following TC Energy (formerly TransCanada) / Coastal GasLink’s interim injunction has been devastating to bear, but this fight is far from over.","popularity":0.5143,"poster_path":"/kKIgfnr0x7T2fJw8ZD8XN08ksaS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121359,"logo_path":"/8jTVa5tdWScXEpx6hhJA2Hwe1LK.png","name":"Mutual Aid Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invasion","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Invasion: The Unist'ot'en's Fight For Sovereignty","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2373877,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Vinal","original_name":"Sam Vinal","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43c5d66469a001be242c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Toledano","original_name":"Michael Toledano","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb43c73f3e0df001e2b867f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":908,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o7EaOxF7VrJKIVeM4tKSkeyaxye.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1616}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kKIgfnr0x7T2fJw8ZD8XN08ksaS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":836,"name":"resistance"},{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":178026,"name":"environmental conservation"},{"id":178027,"name":"environmental destruction"},{"id":190760,"name":"royal canadian mounted police (mountie)"},{"id":195469,"name":"first nations"},{"id":199984,"name":"land theft"},{"id":215522,"name":"british columbia"},{"id":248334,"name":"land rights"},{"id":270976,"name":"indigenous rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hot Docs online programming","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"INVASION","key":"D3R5Uy5O_Ds","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-01T16:00:12.000Z","id":"5eb43da8cc277c002066cb20"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"INVASION Trailer","key":"CRgbju7E5Q8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-28T16:30:37.000Z","id":"646d1d7d51e6ab00e5dd8d50"}]}}}
