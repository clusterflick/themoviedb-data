The rural worker Jiaul, the Bihari brahmin Ram, the homeless drug-dealer Manoj and the young student Tashi live in the same city of Kolkata, but in different worlds. The film tried to find out a few answers - What beliefs rule their everyday lives? How are they affected by the sudden demonetisation? What makes them strangers? And how do people – whose paths would never cross in real life – interact in a cinematic space, where as many signs of their belonging as possible have been ‘stripped off’ and they encounter one another for the first time?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/5tXXnh38XOC7x2be7qXxjTbA9js.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STRANGERS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638533,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laura Kansy","original_name":"Laura Kansy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb571340cb3350021ca087a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Zoche","original_name":"Oskar Zoche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5713ecc277c001f675df3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638533,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laura Kansy","original_name":"Laura Kansy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5712ae375c00020fcf2ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488214,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nina Ergang","original_name":"Nina Ergang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb57169ccb15f002185b6ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8VwxSpY0lZhUEBCVaHurJg6Osm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5tXXnh38XOC7x2be7qXxjTbA9js.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
