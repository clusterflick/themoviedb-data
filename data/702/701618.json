All three are resourceful, positive thinkers who strive to adapt and thrive despite dehumanizing forces at play in the American economy. As the film's heroes face these roadblocks with courage, certain ideals remain sacred: family, love, and staying strong in the face of adversity. Lush cinematography galvanizes a sense of place and, as the narrative unfolds, the intimacy with the characters results in an emotionally rich observational drama. Ultimately, \"The Disrupted\" reveals a collective American experience of financial challenge, family resilience, and the quest for the purpose and dignity of work.","popularity":0.3148,"poster_path":"/x0P4vOVhJbyVAxe8oRseQXPeaRR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disrupted","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629797,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emily Schuman","original_name":"Emily Schuman","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb53d407ac82900222395b6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Gleason","original_name":"Josh Gleason","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb53d02cc277c0021692f74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Troy Herion","original_name":"Troy Herion","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/iPns60MJLo1YwgahNuswzZHZsWb.jpg","credit_id":"5eb53d64c3514c002057e897","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn True","original_name":"Lynn True","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb53d2a7ac8290022239599","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Gleason","original_name":"Josh Gleason","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb53cef7ac8290020230bfa","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Colt","original_name":"Sarah Colt","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb53d0fc3514c002057e815","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1693137,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Bergmann","original_name":"Tom Bergmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edebccaf36a32001e8a15bf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Colt","original_name":"Sarah Colt","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f47570231f20037fdc3cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12438730","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x0P4vOVhJbyVAxe8oRseQXPeaRR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tEUaIKRxyfmpjOaqGrh79tgfm2N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
