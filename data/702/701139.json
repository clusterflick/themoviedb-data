The artist, armed with the skill of rendering their surroundings with utmost acuity, was appointed to remove things from the realm of perception. Bambitchell’s ’Special Works School’ takes its name from this military unit to investigate the connections between artistic practice and surveillant technologies. With this video, the duo ask what an overtly aesthetic approach to surveillance can render visible, or invisible. By framing surveillance as an aesthetic practice, ‘Special Works School’ hones in on the psychic, embodied and material dimensions of surveillance - both from the position of the surveillor and the surveilled.","popularity":0.1064,"poster_path":"/8iUocxd9jFOvPVtggoEzo8uV5yJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","origin_country":""},{"id":133450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gallery TPW","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Special Works School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2024587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharlene Bamboat","original_name":"Sharlene Bamboat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5WMCX1tzj6ChVfcO1lN5dUSjeTQ.jpg","credit_id":"61e82841a9117f00e8400bdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535856,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rita Macedo","original_name":"Rita Macedo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3ccab66469a001ce21d19","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","original_name":"Vika Kirchenbauer","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3cccb0cb3350021c7d9c2","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richy Carey","original_name":"Richy Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3ccf8cc277c0021668a75","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richy Carey","original_name":"Richy Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3ccffc3514c001e54c973","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628626,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dina Georgis","original_name":"Dina Georgis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3cee2cc277c0021668e58","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628627,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Matthews","original_name":"Sara Matthews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3cefdccb15f0021844127","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Simon","original_name":"Kim Simon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb3cf0bcc277c0020663633","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s94EoJABvdc0f7o25DIvw51PNZe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iUocxd9jFOvPVtggoEzo8uV5yJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gallery TPW","release_date":"2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale","release_date":"2018-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI London Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Videomedeja","release_date":"2018-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Istanbul International Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2020-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Union Docs","release_date":"2018-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Special Works School.
