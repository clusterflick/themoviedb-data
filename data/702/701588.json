Her books encompass black American history but live and breathe in the present, rich in vivid characters, haunted by ghosts. Born poor in Ohio in 1931, she now lives in New York. She tells Alan Yentob how her father hated whites so much he wouldn't let them in the house. Her masterpiece, Beloved, shows the horrors of slavery perhaps better than any other artwork. She talks as she writes - with warmth and wit. Contributors include Angela Davis (whose biography she edited) and singer Jessye Norman.","popularity":0.2656,"poster_path":"/kEJHNujrA1U4S3EwW15XgPbHX94.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toni Morrison Remembers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":992503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toni Morrison","original_name":"Toni Morrison","popularity":0.3172,"profile_path":"/ghVvHSzOJbmBKjXo9aJGnSzM0pY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb52172e375c00021fb65f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Davis","original_name":"Angela Davis","popularity":0.3221,"profile_path":"/rCGiP5iycqFodkrxslZl19IsIcf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb5217bcc277c002168f1bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":974382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessye Norman","original_name":"Jessye Norman","popularity":0.3312,"profile_path":"/67lfZQ79OMusxrXnEDq00IWHryF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb52187e375c00020fc4037","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilton Als","original_name":"Hilton Als","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/3f9jshOe5hyWlbEOOzxj7HIVzry.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521b37ac829002022e157","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Giddings","original_name":"Paula Giddings","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521c1e375c00020fc40db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gottlieb","original_name":"Robert Gottlieb","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/zhEQZJk5m8COvMXRWj9KY0YOUEw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521cccc277c002168f1fe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":172175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fran Lebowitz","original_name":"Fran Lebowitz","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/ivFaoK9TTJAqXsEzHCEddKsw5Pq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521d3e375c00022fbbd86","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erroll McDonald","original_name":"Erroll McDonald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521db0cb3350020cac6d8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Muldoon","original_name":"Paul Muldoon","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521e1cc277c002168f222","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taiye Selasi","original_name":"Taiye Selasi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb521eac3514c001e567388","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl B.
