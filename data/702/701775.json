Western industrial production is a site of magical thinking: an old history that will never return, an idealized construction that never really was. It's impossible to know what the true costs would be if it were to return - societal, environmental, and psychological – and yet, entire political campaigns are built around this.  This piece speculates on re-industrialization, and is a sequel to my 2013 video, Safety First (Bad, Don’t Touch, Mercy!). Like its prequel, it posits a non-specific future populated by female factory workers. The geometric aesthetics of power and the romance of industrial-era alienation, are paired with theoretical and fictional texts about alternate social economies.  Video footage was shot in Ohio, animation and soundtrack by the artist. Voiceover text sources include Industrial supply catalogs, OSHA safety manuals, Monique Wittig’s Les Guerilleres, and Adorno’s Minima Moralia.\"  -Taken from Jen Liu's Vimeo page.","popularity":0.3754,"poster_path":"/6BlGNFZhPgK24iOwQC8rVj2CbfQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In factories, everyone has their place.","title":"The Machinist's Lament","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Si","original_name":"Wang Si","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"CHOREOGRAPHER / MASK DANCER / TEST SUBJECT","credit_id":"5eb5bd59c3514c002058bcee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xu Mengchen","original_name":"Xu Mengchen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Test Scientist","credit_id":"5eb5bd70bbe1dd00217fe4c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joelle Lingat","original_name":"Joelle Lingat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Test Chorus","credit_id":"5eb5bd82bbe1dd00207fdfc3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Hamilton","original_name":"Katherine Hamilton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Test Chorus","credit_id":"5eb5bd8fcc277c002068b790","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630385,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ilse Miller","original_name":"Ilse Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5bcf8ccb15f002185eea3","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630387,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nadia Stevens","original_name":"Nadia Stevens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5bd12fd7aa4001c5b0de1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Hochendoner","original_name":"Jake Hochendoner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5bce62fdec6001eebadd0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630388,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ali Post","original_name":"Ali Post","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5bd1cfd7aa4001c5b0dec","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jen Liu","original_name":"Jen Liu","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb5bff1fd7aa4001c5b10ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6BlGNFZhPgK24iOwQC8rVj2CbfQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11718,"name":"feminist"},{"id":209086,"name":"industrial"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Machinist’s Lament - 2014  - English Subtitles","key":"191655481","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-11-15T15:39:43.000Z","id":"5eb5bdf1fd7aa4001c5b0ef3"}]}}}
