The women attribute their health problems to social and labour policies. The health clinic responds with medication, sports programs and occupational therapy. The film underlines the need for self-organization and ends with the realization that these women must develop their own strategies.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/dYm3bCRm5OrTRyZSx0n8vkP6KAg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Can Only Help Ourselves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3955277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gardi Deppe","original_name":"Gardi Deppe","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cccceb15d97b1a93cedb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1455671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Liccini","original_name":"Rolf Liccini","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cccdab15d97b1a93cedba","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951640,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Helga Schnurre","original_name":"Helga Schnurre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670ccd011ca4c39fdeeb7ff1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34145846","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYm3bCRm5OrTRyZSx0n8vkP6KAg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
