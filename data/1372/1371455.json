She had just turned 19. The film follows the story of Diane's life, from her own testimony and that of corrections officers, prison caseworkers and psychiatrists. Many show remarkable sympathy and affection for a troubled woman whose early life was marked by abuse. Sentenced to life is a strong film that raises difficult questions about prisoners with mental health problems.","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sentenced to Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"condamné à perpétuité","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5001178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Charron","original_name":"Diane Charron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"670ddd329f3531e6b26c42be","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Cadieux","original_name":"Marie Cadieux","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670ddd5cb15d97b1a93d5d01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Turgeon","original_name":"Jacques Turgeon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c464f134f4881610114e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484618,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Ménard","original_name":"Jacques Ménard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c465bbb7269b6b34d09fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194583,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Louise Dugal","original_name":"Louise Dugal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679c466f18d39b0264011f51","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34621934","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
