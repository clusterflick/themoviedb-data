Katinka was a German who became related to the Serbian people and as such refused to cooperate with the Germans in 1941. That is why, together with the children and their families, she was expelled from their palace. They welcomed the end of the war in their vineyard cottages. When the liberators came in 1944, they expelled them from there as well, as representatives of the defeated bourgeoisie. This is a film about the tragic fate of a woman, but also about Milos Savcic and the development of Serbia during the first half of the 20th century.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iMe4KBdo92bJwcEWZj9kM44pryR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fiks Fokus","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katinka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nataša Popovska","original_name":"Nataša Popovska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Katinka","credit_id":"670f002604331db4b11256d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002930,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marko Kovač","original_name":"Marko Kovač","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nemački oficir 1","credit_id":"670f002004331db4b11256cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002929,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milan Z.
