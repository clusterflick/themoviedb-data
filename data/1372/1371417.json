The overall view is of a horizontal rotation as you ascend from your feet to the sun, but this is the first half of the film. In the latter half of the sequence, a man appears in front of the screen with a guitar and performs an improvised performance in the style of the Tsugaru shamisen. The atmosphere of the film changes drastically as the sounds of nature are replaced with music, making this a strange film, for better or worse.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2gybuqBjlPDjvD3hcWlp0oTeZxK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE CRAMPED AREA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isao Kota","original_name":"Isao Kota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670db9170b800537d75cb0ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2gybuqBjlPDjvD3hcWlp0oTeZxK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
