Generations grew up listening to it under the bedclothes. But last year 208 went off the airwaves and now it can only be reached by satellite. This nostalgic portrait of \"the station of the stars\" talks to some of its former DJs including Jimmy Savile ,Noel Edmonds , Pete Murray , David \"Kid\" Jensen and Tony \"Your Royal Ruler\" Prince, about their days in the Duchy. And listeners, such as Cliff Richard and Tim Rice , describe how they heard their first rock 'n' roll on Radio Luxembourg.","popularity":0.4582,"poster_path":"/p9KzLtQEmHpqTM8jBJpvI06mi2S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell, FAB 208","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Savile","original_name":"Jimmy Savile","popularity":0.2806,"profile_path":"/vRyxr8hH9jUiXvb8Lhb7OZbd68S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"670e84f99f3531e6b26c7a7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1965711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Jacobs","original_name":"David Jacobs","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"670e850842e1391c56671ccb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1226244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Murray","original_name":"Pete Murray","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"670e850fb15d97b1a93d9e14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Edmonds","original_name":"Noel Edmonds","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/1Noqcj0PhRTJNXamw2gQO75yVz0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"670e8516f58a9206aa41f0f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David 'Kid' Jensen","original_name":"David 'Kid' Jensen","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/c8zEebf9SEZLCCWC4BHKCnD4GOK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"670e8527b15d97b1a93d9e1a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Richard","original_name":"Cliff Richard","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":"/6GFjqrMxg1DNV6AU7HHn00p6wdj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"670e852db15d97b1a93d9e24","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Rice","original_name":"Tim Rice","popularity":0.1867,"profile_path":"/5dUxyx7fkGJiTi8WzShL6rA2qZJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"670e854a42e1391c56671d13","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1944365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sutch","original_name":"David Sutch","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"670e8574b15d97b1a93d9e65","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pitman","original_name":"John Pitman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e84e6b15d97b1a93d9ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p9KzLtQEmHpqTM8jBJpvI06mi2S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
