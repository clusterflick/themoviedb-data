In the text, the speaker feels awkward and nervous at a club and meets ’Jiwon‘, visiting different places and sharing communal movements and affect. Based on the senses emerging from the text - nervousness, self-consciousness, relaxedness, awkwardness, and etc. - Sunghyun who performed for this piece choreographed movements with me. In this work, Sunghyun presents texts that are printed in reverse on the mirror and performs movements that are sometimes related, not related, or maybe extended from the text. By putting text and movements together, we think about how our bodies move and what it is about to move together with others.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/lj4qoLr8udUgA8Oqe0dRYcwvgxr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"withal our bodies we are","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sughyun Seren Park","original_name":"Sughyun Seren Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67149ec6c6e3040961962293","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5010842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ale sánchez trejo","original_name":"ale sánchez trejo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67149f1199f22f326aad5c05","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.747,"height":2678,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/lj4qoLr8udUgA8Oqe0dRYcwvgxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"우리는 우리의 몸으로 withal our bodies we are (trailer)","key":"935665992","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-16T23:52:43.000Z","id":"6714a0e8d5b7926e947002dc"}]}}}
