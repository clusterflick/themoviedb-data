Urged to continue their studies, it's time to leave for mainland France and Canada. Manon, Evie, Enguerrand and their friends are about to spend their last summer on the islands together. In the turmoil that precedes this leap into the void, these budding adults, like previous generations, are confronted with this particular moment in their lives. They'll have to leave. But they are islanders, and this departure has the air of exile, of uprooting with no certainty of return.  As they leave adolescence, they will be uprooted from their land, crossing a border that is both symbolic and physical. The idea is that something happens here that is more observable than elsewhere, something that concentrates and accelerates the transformations of the teenagers' personalities.","popularity":0.0651,"poster_path":"/jvDpGZocQBPNBjiQ4Ku8p0fCqRz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107792,"logo_path":"/3c6UduemVcjkqX5SQhDvsH1IBGo.png","name":"La Clairière Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vous serez parés pour le vent","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576830,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Samuel Picas","original_name":"Samuel Picas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d9bcd0b800537d75ca8fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claire Beffa","original_name":"Claire Beffa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d9bf99f3531e6b26c2698","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidonie Garnier","original_name":"Sidonie Garnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d9c099f3531e6b26c26a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeanne Thibord","original_name":"Jeanne Thibord","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d9c1ab15d97b1a93d447f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576830,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Samuel Picas","original_name":"Samuel Picas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670da1730b800537d75caa26","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dUejhk1K0zqBHmYQvtK5gJ2EBiU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDoNkAoVMUQkocUQoMY7cvFwAL2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jvDpGZocQBPNBjiQ4Ku8p0fCqRz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":704,"name":"adolescence"},{"id":339861,"name":"saint-pierre et miquelon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
