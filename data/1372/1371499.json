Blurring the lines between a mystical, natural setting and Macy’s daily reality, Gibson’s film examines the private and personal routines of transformation and self. The film’s location, the Choctaw reservation in central Mississippi where Gibson’s family is from, plays a significant role in the film’s blend of spirituality, ritual, and the fantastical. The film was commissioned by the Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art at Hamilton College for Gibson’s 2018 exhibition This Is the Day.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4584850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Gibson","original_name":"Jeffrey Gibson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e0d48d5f93a3da0bc22fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1679172,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tanya Tagaq","original_name":"Tanya Tagaq","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/r3oP3qJUKUAdLnRN1z2j8j0nXiX.jpg","credit_id":"670e0d7042e1391c5666f78b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
