(Oldies and Two aren't even listed in AniDB.) Unlike Heart Cocktail, they have minimal animation and no dialog. Like a silent movie (or A-Girl), they have constant music, and signs or intertitles provide the dialog. The signs conveying the dialog are set as ordinary subtitles; only actual signs have been typeset.  Two on the Road is the longest of the three. It tells a continuous story about a couple, Akira and Yumi, who are colleagues at work.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/dhOzUnoD982JHljbMpsnAZggREN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two On The Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Two on the Road: Itsumo Futari de","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1453716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seizou Watase","original_name":"Seizou Watase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670ee2c5547de4a74f60a652","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masaru Shimabukuro","original_name":"Masaru Shimabukuro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670ee2f2019f3bc5b11babd5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hitoshi Uechi","original_name":"Hitoshi Uechi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670ee30204331db4b1124eec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eishō Higa","original_name":"Eishō Higa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670ee30e04331db4b1124efd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":2796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhOzUnoD982JHljbMpsnAZggREN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1884},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVziroH5crI04ddW6LA6L7uWJjv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":2796,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ppXuOEDUzQuWA4KXfs3syQqed1d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
