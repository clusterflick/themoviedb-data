In his 80s, he’s as busy as ever, with regular exhibitions in Ireland and abroad. In addition to this heavy workload, he feels strongly about the suffering of refugees around the world and for a number of years has travelled to Athens to volunteer at Camp Eleonas, a state-run centre for migrants, and delivered art workshops to adults and children. His artistic practice has always dealt with displacement and emigration.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"John Behan RHA is Ireland’s best living sculptor.","title":"John Behan - Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28382697","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
