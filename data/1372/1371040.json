The work commences with the projection of a long loop of black 16mm film leader suspended from the ceiling. The artist punches a hole on the film's surface and as it loops through the projector's gate, a single white circle of light pierces the darkness. With each subsequent punch the film builds before the viewer’s eyes into a cascade of white circles before reaching its abrupt and revelatory conclusion.","popularity":0.0731,"poster_path":"/aGGZK4D4rEQfJnVGEBD3zZEyqr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circle & Square","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Circle and Square","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","credit_id":"670cdc193bb4557c669c0169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aGGZK4D4rEQfJnVGEBD3zZEyqr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
