Not the way her terminally ill father sees her, and not the way her Church Support Group sees her. Not even the way her mentor, Kathy sees her. Really seen. Newly sober and ready to start her life again, Rachel (Caroline Levien) finds herself back with her father, Glen (Nicholas Hope) and languishing in the role of his primary carer. Lonely and overlooked, Rachel turns to her online persona, 'J@de' and the world of chat-room camming as a place to see and be seen. But Rachel's escapism cannot keep the real world at bay forever. As Glen's illness deteriorates, Rachel's online identity pushes up against her own, bringing her face to face with the ultimate act of exposure.","popularity":0.3909,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exposure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Levien","original_name":"Caroline Levien","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uzmrGUkAdVz9vMg5KgR5zm1hsf8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"670d138742e1391c56669a6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Hope","original_name":"Nicholas Hope","popularity":0.2885,"profile_path":"/jwl6mahxUgnLvaCfmKiQLN9M2f6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Glen","credit_id":"670d1416b15d97b1a93d0e20","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pippa Grandison","original_name":"Pippa Grandison","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/8p1dZSbootjFGs97g9WiFIeP1Xr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kathy","credit_id":"670f592133e1478f766dc58b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Chong Nee","original_name":"Ray Chong Nee","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/d85v7vNssOaQsvmH08ga86MPnaT.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"670f59a57a22bf3607f28987","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1085684,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Orrell","original_name":"Lauren Orrell","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/mdXX9U31nENNQ4Wp1L6PlaPTDPV.jpg","credit_id":"670d133242e1391c56669a3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Levien","original_name":"Caroline Levien","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uzmrGUkAdVz9vMg5KgR5zm1hsf8.jpg","credit_id":"670d135242e1391c56669a58","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Levien","original_name":"Caroline Levien","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uzmrGUkAdVz9vMg5KgR5zm1hsf8.jpg","credit_id":"670d136c0b800537d75c7121","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1085684,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Orrell","original_name":"Lauren Orrell","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/mdXX9U31nENNQ4Wp1L6PlaPTDPV.jpg","credit_id":"670d1376b15d97b1a93d0db3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602445,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chris Bland","original_name":"Chris Bland","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f594633e1478f766dc5af","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895549,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan Berghofer","original_name":"Dan Berghofer","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670f596f547de4a74f60c277","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33333458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Dark Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
