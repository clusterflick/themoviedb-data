He began playing the harp as a child, without formal instruction. He was baptized by the Colombian press with the nickname Metralleta due to the dexterity and speed with which he moves his fingers and shoots notes. Over time, this harp virtuoso, who was initially criticized by music academics, managed to develop a unique style, which today is admired and respected worldwide. At 39 years old, Carlos has participated in numerous musical events in England, Japan and the United States.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/iwkkomgikDVQtMQDnqX4H5K1jaj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206132,"logo_path":null,"name":"G-Train Productions
