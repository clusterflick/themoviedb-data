When a beauty queen sees a poster touting a “Swimsuit Contest for Bathing Beauties!” her dreams of victory and accolades seem to be in direct conflict with her love of desserts. In her determination to win, she runs a gauntlet of bonbons, cupcakes and other treats, fighting against her desires and fear of gaining weight. Her wordless struggles with temptation hold a comic mirror to pop culture’s unrealistic female body imagery and fat-shaming.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/hBEVrksZNO59ckQtsyRrYs1Me9Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18359,"logo_path":"/kCKM088vKrlqO6ch2ClT6eCCV5j.png","name":"Ringling College of Art + Design","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonbon Voyage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5001574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Ream","original_name":"Emma Ream","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e2f0a9f3531e6b26c5d97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5001574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Ream","original_name":"Emma Ream","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e2f5e42e1391c5667039e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5001578,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lisa DeSpain","original_name":"Lisa DeSpain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e2f7c42e1391c566703b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1239941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Barry","original_name":"Chris Barry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e2f97f58a9206aa41d65f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hBEVrksZNO59ckQtsyRrYs1Me9Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"Thessaloniki Animation Festival (TAF)","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
