We had a World War, the Spanish flu pandemic, the first strikes in Brazil, and frosts threatening coffee plantations, announcig the beginning of a transition from rural to urban areas. And, in the midst of all this, painters, musicians and writers propose new paths for art. Set in the period from 1917 to 1922, the series presents the influences of all these events in a group of friends formed by Anita Malfatti, Oswald de Andrade, Mário de Andrade, Menotti Del Picchia and Tarsila do Amaral, who are willing to lead the changes they believe need to be made. With them, we will follow the first steps towards the creation of the transformative movement Brazilian Modernism.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aqueles Dias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hélio Goldsztejn","original_name":"Hélio Goldsztejn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670dfe3a0b800537d75cc93a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5001304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beto Marquez","original_name":"Beto Marquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670dfe51b15d97b1a93d6ace","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
