An empathetic look at a physical journey and the melodramas of a journey that is spiritual. Nikita Pavlov emigrated from Russia to Israel because he always wanted to experience life in another country. Street protests, political activism, and his daughters first steps are captured without any chronological context, separated only by Pavlovs thoughts and ideas. A cinematic diary that attempts to piece together a hypothetical picture of the filmmakers future.","popularity":0.18,"poster_path":"/5F2sHRk3bRESd0ikUm2dhkV2rxT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When New Year Comes on Shabbat","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Когда Новый год наступает в субботу","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Vorotnikov","original_name":"Oleg Vorotnikov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vor","credit_id":"670eacf40b800537d75d1405","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasper Vorotnikov","original_name":"Kasper Vorotnikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kasper","credit_id":"670ead0d0b800537d75d1417","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Sokol","original_name":"Natalya Sokol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Koza","credit_id":"670ead539f3531e6b26c8e96","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikita Pavlov","original_name":"Nikita Pavlov","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/1WiQEL84GE5yS9qNIZ8c0wvzNIx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nikita Pavlov","credit_id":"670ead9c0b800537d75d1429","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikita Pavlov","original_name":"Nikita Pavlov","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/1WiQEL84GE5yS9qNIZ8c0wvzNIx.jpg","credit_id":"670eadb5f58a9206aa42045f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480775,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikita Pavlov","original_name":"Nikita Pavlov","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/1WiQEL84GE5yS9qNIZ8c0wvzNIx.jpg","credit_id":"670eadc50b800537d75d1459","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1480774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Laden","original_name":"Petr Laden","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/ph3oR25mtgUEOuat5kGqQRKGs0R.jpg","credit_id":"670eadd20b800537d75d1462","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4106639,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Victoria Chupahina","original_name":"Victoria Chupahina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mqmbGQrq40fgFtBh9JS6D2Xe9kX.jpg","credit_id":"670eade8f58a9206aa420495","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165228,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Konstantin Shavlovsky","original_name":"Konstantin Shavlovsky","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/jKnIVplfap3Q2nVI1hryWpZvJHa.jpg","credit_id":"670eae020b800537d75d1496","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1999319","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5F2sHRk3bRESd0ikUm2dhkV2rxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":311315,"name":"dramatic"},{"id":325824,"name":"hopeful"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jihlava IDFF","release_date":"2012-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
