Since fleeing Cambodia with her family during the Khmer Rouge regime, and a genocide which devastated an entire culture and displaced millions of people from their homes, award-winning documentary filmmaker Kalyanee Mam has spent much of her life searching for a rooted connection to place. This film follows her to the landscapes of her homeland—changing through deforestation, industrialization, urbanization and development—where she has spent years tenderly documenting the disappearing, relational ways of life held within them. As she comes to know these places not only through the lens of her camera, but through the intimate relationships she forms with the landscapes and people whose stories she shares, Kalyanee awakens an ancestral memory of the taste of the land that lies within.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/vnzaQcwlDDLiDMutnwH1eokMCoQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emergence Magazine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taste of the Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232154,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kalyanee Mam","original_name":"Kalyanee Mam","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"670dd3540b800537d75cbb3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5001126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Loften","original_name":"Adam Loften","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670dd32ef58a9206aa41b68d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee","original_name":"Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ejTfbGZlR06XxdepmrcJBJWLhJm.jpg","credit_id":"670dd33df58a9206aa41b693","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnzaQcwlDDLiDMutnwH1eokMCoQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
