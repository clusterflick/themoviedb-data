The work has been called the 'Symphony of a Thousand', and requires eight soloists and several choirs, in addition to the orchestra. Edward Gardner's last concert in the role of Chief Conductor of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra was during the Bergen International Festival, with the monumental Mahler's 8th Symphony in E-flat major on the programme. The concert won the Critics' Prize for Music 2023–2024, and what has been described as a \"heavenly finale\" has been captured for the big screen. 'Try to imagine the whole universe beginning to ring and resound. There are no longer human voices, but planets and suns revolving.' the composer said of his eighth symphony. When the work was premiered in 1910, with Mahler conducting, it broke all the rules and boundaries of what symphonies could and should be.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":"/gEfBmFlygMtKUAleSaNJ3EHRkQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler 8.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567031,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Gardner","original_name":"Edward Gardner","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d115769107d77b475480","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Håkon Matti Skrede","original_name":"Håkon Matti Skrede","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d1271ea33928297cce1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Bell","original_name":"Emma Bell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fePB74JPwxR0GhoF7MNnkcG9064.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d144769107d77b475489","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marita Sølberg","original_name":"Marita Sølberg","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d14c1ea33928297cce20","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari Eriksmoen","original_name":"Mari Eriksmoen","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d156fefd1e0510ffbffd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefanie Irányi","original_name":"Stefanie Irányi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d15f769107d77b47548e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jess Dandy","original_name":"Jess Dandy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d1756d6b705dc871071d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Butt Philip","original_name":"David Butt Philip","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d1926d6b705dc8710725","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yngve Soberg","original_name":"Yngve Soberg","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d1ae769107d77b4754a3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Relyea","original_name":"John Relyea","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/k0fNi4cMx4mdf8TIY1bCu7AqhRR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6718d1b8769107d77b4754a7","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marius Marthinussen Søreide","original_name":"Marius Marthinussen Søreide","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718d0f1e833d92ef05fadf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":2239,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/gEfBmFlygMtKUAleSaNJ3EHRkQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bergen International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
