One world is that of the Sirens, the hybrid female creatures of the wild sea and the other world is a society of typical humans, of gloom, oppression, separation and war. Colours intertwine with black, healing songs are born for sailors wandering on the magical and difficult journey of life. The feminine principle struggles to find and initiate her power through her song. But where is this song born? Is it somewhere there on the outskirts of Hades, at the bottom of the human soul and the sea? All that is left of the confrontation with death is the song. It is the symbol of a struggle for life itself, an initiation into the power of the woman who transforms. She shares wings, love and songs. But who, will extend his hand to receive the gifts of life?","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":"/sZZ9V2mCUWNa7S48qHSZppHVF69.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Athens
