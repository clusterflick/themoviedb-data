The Kosovo War (1999) left the region, which is now under the protection of the United Nation, with lasting scars. The Kosovar Albanians wish to form an independent nation with or without Serbia's consent. Serbia is not willing to shift its borders and lose what it considers to be the \"cradle\" of the Serbian nation. NOESTAMODEPASO PRODUCTIONS exams the present and the future of this Balkan region that has the highest rates of unemployment and illiteracy in all of Europe. Furthermore, over half of the population is under 20 years of age. Gaps and inconsistencies in the law have turned Kosovo into a chaotic mess with few guaranteed fundamental rights. There is no freedom of movement, houses remain occupied and children are assigned to schools based on their ethnicity. Everybody wants to look towards the future; however, the pain of the past is still very present, making Kosovo the last scar of the Balkans.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bpLU6kOKNJN6ptQTIZMcQJ1Ka1c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noestamosdepaso Proyectos Audiovisuales","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2007-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kosovo, the Last Scar of the Balkans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Antonio Moreno Amador","original_name":"Juan Antonio Moreno Amador","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cf45df58a9206aa415a99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Antonio Moreno Amador","original_name":"Juan Antonio Moreno Amador","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cf465f58a9206aa415a9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4999727,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guillem Ruisanchez","original_name":"Guillem Ruisanchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cf475f58a9206aa415aae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1463085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Silvia Venegas Venegas","original_name":"Silvia Venegas Venegas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670cf47df58a9206aa415ab3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1822244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bpLU6kOKNJN6ptQTIZMcQJ1Ka1c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
