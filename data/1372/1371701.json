This video focuses on some of them and, through them, highlights some of the issues. Filmed in Khayelitsha, Bellville South, Maitland and the Willows, Lebowa, it depicts their home environment and the communities in which they grow up. The children themselves provide much of the information, with additional comments from friends and relatives. Fathers are conspicuous by their absence, which would seem to be one of the main problems, others being the lack of adequate care, education, food, safety and the impact of violence on their lives. At the same time the program reveals the children's resourcefulness when it comes to games, with some most original songs and chants coming from the Cape Flats.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Duiwel Maak My Hart So Seer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
