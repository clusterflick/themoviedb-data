This film takes us on a journey through the stories of resistance and struggle of marginalized groups, highlighting their voices and their daily battles for the legitimate occupation of urban space. From the colorful streets of Jardim da União to the community garden of Mulheres do GAU, from the warm theater of Cia Mungunzá to the ancestry preserved in Pico do Jaraguá, we are invited to witness the strength and resilience of these communities. Each scene reminds us of the richness of diversity and the need to build a more inclusive and fair city for everyone.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"São Paulo: Occupied City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Ribeiro","original_name":"Gustavo Ribeiro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670dea4242e1391c5666eef5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
