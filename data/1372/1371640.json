On a hill above a sea of clouds lives Ugo, a small penguin with a big dream: to fly in the sky like the other postal birds. However, due to his wings being unsuitable for flight, this profession seems out of reach for him. But after several risky attempts to fly, Ugo understands the importance of persevering with caution and accepting his physical limitations. Thanks to his ingenuity and adaptability, he ultimately manages to take flight in his own way and, with the right safety measures, achieve the job of his dreams.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/yP3Ge0R15syTul6oBRVZvGX9xjp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A dream takes flight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5002007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Helm","original_name":"Chiara Helm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e714942e1391c566716ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5002007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Helm","original_name":"Chiara Helm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e7197f58a9206aa41ec1c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002012,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michele Mistrorigo","original_name":"Michele Mistrorigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e71a69f3531e6b26c71c2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Gavazzeni","original_name":"Thomas Gavazzeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e71b742e1391c5667173a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929500,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Pietro Pinetti","original_name":"Pietro Pinetti","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/y9EU2Hg1QpQ2GtucnBJXos2DJ4F.jpg","credit_id":"670e71c80b800537d75cf74d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588001,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Andrea Bozzetto","original_name":"Andrea Bozzetto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e71d90b800537d75cf750","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4779078,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rossella Mercurio","original_name":"Rossella Mercurio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e71e90b800537d75cf770","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Niccolò Sacchi","original_name":"Niccolò Sacchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e71f90b800537d75cf788","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yP3Ge0R15syTul6oBRVZvGX9xjp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"10th Thessaloniki Animation Festival (TAF)","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
