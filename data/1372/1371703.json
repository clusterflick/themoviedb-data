A Royal Ballet star, a man who owns a share in a race horse, and a peer's daughter now live side by side with old folk who have rented their houses all their lives. Once the street was filled with families. Now it's being taken over and tarted up by the young rich with no children. 'Funeral today - skip tomorrow' is how the locals describe what's happening.  Had they been able to afford it, the old timers could have bought their homes for £200. Now unmodemised two-up two-downs with outside loos are snapped up at £150,000.","popularity":0.0598,"poster_path":"/4LUgByiSOA905QFdKUetw4mH7EG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Sides of the Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pitman","original_name":"John Pitman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"680a945315a1d5a614ab33d0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Pitman","original_name":"John Pitman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e8ff7d5f93a3da0bc5dc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Mirzoeff","original_name":"Edward Mirzoeff","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670e900142e1391c566723a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4LUgByiSOA905QFdKUetw4mH7EG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
