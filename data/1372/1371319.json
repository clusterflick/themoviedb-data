As is the script of every self-respecting rock band, Cachorro Grande lived and survived amid contrasts and extremes. From being the greatest promise of Brazilian rock’n roll at the beginning of this century, opening shows for the Rolling Stones in Brazil, to going through open fights that shaped the band’s style and created fissures, culminating in the threat of its disbandment.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/oPd0scxxKXcv9Z9hPr6weDnmc5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144506,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chá Cinematográfico","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Rock Band","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lírio Ferreira","original_name":"Lírio Ferreira","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/vCKoM7l8WzxyEwIzcjIpMZIFzce.jpg","credit_id":"670d81e842e1391c5666ca7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5095519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Butler","original_name":"Anna Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677af00615521f83d966fffc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chica Mendonça","original_name":"Chica Mendonça","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677af0112b097b15a274ecb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1302721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sampaio","original_name":"André Sampaio","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677af03455d4b38f9366ff63","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1964884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jander Antunes","original_name":"Jander Antunes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677af04f2b097b15a274ece8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4060520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Pelotas","original_name":"Pedro Pelotas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677af05bcf4d59c84f72392a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPd0scxxKXcv9Z9hPr6weDnmc5W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
