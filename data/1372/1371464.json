They talk about the tearing away of their freedom and the human rights abuses inflicted on them by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Stories show clearly that for these women, there was no option but to flee and seek refuge in another country. In the UK the British media do not welcome asylum seekers with open arms, the words 'bogus' and 'fake' often precede the word refugee. The women in this film unveil a chilling and dark tale, after which nobody could question the validity of their plight.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Women Are Banned","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4269686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tassia Kobylinska","original_name":"Tassia Kobylinska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670de5dc0b800537d75cc202","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"isff","release_date":"2001-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"unaff","release_date":"2001-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
