Songs once sung to lull children, tales whispered by parents, and games played with sticks, stones, or dragonflies re-emerge as elders recount them—sometimes laughing, sometimes grieving. The film reflects on how the apparatus mediates these transmissions. Between oral history and the camera’s framing, it explores how memory is shaped, reenacted, and perhaps even transformed through the production and consumption of technical images.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Rangsot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615497,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dhuha Ramadhani","original_name":"Dhuha Ramadhani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920f48c0423198c74fa3427","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FFD","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
