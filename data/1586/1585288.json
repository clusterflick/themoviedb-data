Emerging from Macondo, the film foregrounds the domestic routines of the Buendía women who repair and renovate the house each time it collapses under extraordinary events across the century. These recurring gestures, which in the novel traverse generations, are recontextualized through the logic of contemporary reality and reconfigured into a visual play of form that interrogates narrativity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5831368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kayla Miska","original_name":"Kayla Miska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920ddce2b92d38310eb6f19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
