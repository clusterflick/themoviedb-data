While this sounds like the start of an apocalyptic disaster movie, it is in fact, reality. The Doomsday Clock is a warning of man's ability to create something that could destroy everything, humanity's very existence, a count-down timer to the point of no return - humanity's doomsday. It symbolizes how close humans as a species, have come to destroying the world with dangerous man-made technologies. The deadline of Midnight represents the moment of Apocalypse, and how close the clock is set to that deadline warns how close humanity is to ultimate disaster. With the intention of warning the public and inspiring action, the clock's hands are set in accordance to how great is the threat of destruction. Now, in the 21st century we are closer to Doomsday than ever before.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"100 Seconds to Midnight: Doomsday Clock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21450186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
