The worst offenders were sent to remote farms for forced labor. This film documents a group of intellectuals who were persecuted during the Anti-Rightist Movement and exiled to the “Jiangnan Station” at the Malan Re-education Through Labor Farm in Xunyi County, Shaanxi Province. The five survivors who can now be found, all over 80 years old, recall the Anti-Rightist Movement at Xi'an University and the cruel and inhumane torture they suffered in the “Jiangnan Station” labor camp，and what they think about history now.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qSgLvqRL1YCoXMvUBZ6gbgllNhC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Friends from Jiangnan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSgLvqRL1YCoXMvUBZ6gbgllNhC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
