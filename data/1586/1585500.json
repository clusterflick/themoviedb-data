In this audacious \"one-man show,\" filmmaker Roland Wehap sets out to answer a radical question: Can you make a feature film entirely on your own and with almost no budget? With biting humor and raw honesty, the film chronicles the trials of a fiercely independent artist chasing recognition, glory - and maybe even a touch of immortality - through his uncompromising vision. Along the way, he crafts a film about his sleeping cat, launches his own film festival after rejections pile up, and briefly grabs the spotlight on the international stage. But behind the absurdity lies a sobering truth: success in the spotlight doesn't always pay the bills. Ultimately, A Film by Roland Wehap is both a satire and a love letter to filmmaking itself - a testament to creative persistence, no matter the odds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One filmmaker.
