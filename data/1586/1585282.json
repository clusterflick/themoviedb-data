Drawing from newspaper archives and the incident site, the work asks what printed words conceal, preserve, or reveal. In revisiting the 1984 Tanjung Priok tragedy, it examines both the violence itself and the contested role of media in shaping memory and truth. Two narratives emerge: official accounts and marginal voices. By confronting archival dissonance, the film exposes how media operates—exhuming suppressed histories and counter-narratives, and suggesting that history is shaped not only by authorities, but also by what remains unwritten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody Ever Dies Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961178,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fachri Ghazali","original_name":"Fachri Ghazali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920dbdea132dbca102e3247","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FFD","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
