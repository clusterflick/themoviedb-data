The project was initiated by Nicole Brenez and Nathalie Hubert, in response to the blinding of filmmaker Joachim Gatti in one eye, when a police officer fired a flash-ball into a group of peaceful protestors in Montreuil in July 2009. It was first published on the website of the online newspaper Mediapart on December 10, 2009, with a new part released each day, and remained accessible for several months.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bjxeLTuIyh9vo5PehwHwgcgHHcR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Waddington","original_name":"Laura Waddington","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692089f6d5863c198105904c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a3Dtcz5leKrw3WgLE4NW3NKSFq1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bjxeLTuIyh9vo5PehwHwgcgHHcR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
