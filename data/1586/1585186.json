The story follows multiple characters and shows things from their perspective as they find themselves in a grand plot orchestrated initially by Jules Archibald. It all turns out however to be the result of Blutarch and Redmond's petty rivalry.  It all plays out in a confusing and seemingly convulted manner as the perspectives of each character bleed into each other and it can be hard to tell what is what.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19047,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fortress Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emesis Blue","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5783230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazzyjoeyjr","original_name":"Jazzyjoeyjr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"6920b71b669258848a058f14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5783231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Love","original_name":"David Love","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jules Archibald, Blutarch Mann","credit_id":"6920b74882e176b77b5d61cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5783233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Nichols","original_name":"Cameron Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Scout","credit_id":"6920b77e39ba0930b05d642a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5831019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Whinfield","original_name":"John Whinfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Background voices","credit_id":"6920b78e9de4b60283fa3501","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5783264,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Anton Pelizzari","original_name":"Anton Pelizzari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Zed & Dell Conagher, background voices","credit_id":"6920b7a065fbc1253fc2d5c8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5831023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Payne","original_name":"Chad Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Fritz Ludwig, the Detective, Cyclops, Maynard Conagher, Redmond Mann, the Hunter, Agent Stemmons, Stalingrad","credit_id":"6920b7bfb41a7156f82e3244","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2563781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick May","original_name":"Rick May","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/nnmr0bAsVoGxqNSznsU2OQ37rxG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Additional voices for Soldier","credit_id":"6920b7e8fb52e9a8c5adc4b0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5831046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Payne","original_name":"Chad Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920b9f849576391f9fa350b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5831047,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chad Payne","original_name":"Chad Payne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920ba015ae0388c074a3177","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5783238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Pelizzari","original_name":"Anton Pelizzari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920bb2e636dcd54ed21aeca","department":"Crew","job":"Production Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26900526","wikidata_id":"Q122143513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":189978,"name":"fan film"},{"id":281237,"name":"independent film"},{"id":295907,"name":"psychological horror"},{"id":350314,"name":"team fortress 2"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
