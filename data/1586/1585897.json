Considered the first of its kind, the BJQFF is the only continuous, community-based non-governmental film festival with a special focus on gender and sexuality in China. Given the politically sensitive nature of LGBTQ issues in China, as well as China’s strict media censorship, the Festival has encountered enormous difficulties in its development. In the past thirteen years, its venue has shifted from the western suburbs to the eastern, and from city to countryside. In 2011 it returned to the city and embraced a true guerrilla strategy due to government intervention and censorship. Based on recorded footage collected by the BJQFF organizing committee each year, Our Story contains interviews with committee members, letting them tell the story of the festival and of themselves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ge5jPBiaRQX9ENLjc7LCsnooGnH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Story: The Beijing Queer Film Festival’s 10 Years of “Guerrilla Warfare”","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ge5jPBiaRQX9ENLjc7LCsnooGnH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
