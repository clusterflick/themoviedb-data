Girls experience and women remember being twelve years old, jammed together in a menstrual hearse (a white Talbot lined with red velvet). The body remembers what the mind forgets, going forwards towards the past.

My mother asks for a bag over her head.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/b6pHvKsXaO3huJfvnQ4jdcSpFqX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Damsel Jam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1923691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Miles","original_name":"Sarah Miles","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/hOJGcDpTdOlSsZxU7FNtY9hFIUr.jpg","credit_id":"69223c28fc18c65522768718","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1584,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b6pHvKsXaO3huJfvnQ4jdcSpFqX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1056}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
