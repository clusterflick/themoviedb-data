The soldiers are met at Wetzlar station by, among others, gendarme Otto Wallenreich. After the train arrives, the dignitaries, including the administrative officer of the Wetzlar district command, greet the non-commissioned officer cadets. The troop, led by the commanding captain, his adjutants, and the company lieutenant, leaves the station without forming a formation, marches through Bahnhofstraße, and lines up on Domplatz. Because the mayor of Wetzlar is unable to attend that day, the first deputy, Siegmund Hiepel, inspects the formation with the commander. The troop marches off.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1914-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einzug der Unteroffizierschule in Wetzlar 1914","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5830366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Barnack","original_name":"Oskar Barnack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920ba2b5ae0388c074a3180","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
