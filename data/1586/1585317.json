Physical traces of local legends, anecdotes, and journalistic accounts intertwine with Rorschach-like marble patterns and contemporary debates on public sculpture. Together, they reveal how imagination shapes and sculpts the territory, exposing underlying socio-political dynamics and addressing the extractivist human activity of local marble quarries. Moving between legitimation, acceptance, and censorship, the film invites viewers to reflect on the creation and interpretation of form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Vague Outline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giorgia Piffaretti","original_name":"Giorgia Piffaretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920e8656676dcc718fa3568","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FFD","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
