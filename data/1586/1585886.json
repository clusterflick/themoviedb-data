In this film, Horne interviews legendary NPIC photo interpreter Dino Brugioni, who speaks for the first time about another NPIC examination of the film the day after the assassination. Brugioni didn't know about the second examination and believes the Zapruder Film in the archives today is not the film he saw the day after the assassination.  Drawing on Volume 4 of his book \"Inside the ARRB\", Doug Horne introduces the subject and presents his conclusions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":99625,"logo_path":null,"name":"E2 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zapruder Film Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3445621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Horne","original_name":"Douglas Horne","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69225035ac3f8b161a186e34","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino Brugioni","original_name":"Dino Brugioni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6922506e2fc43065f80ba51c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":448930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shane O'Sullivan","original_name":"Shane O'Sullivan","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692250cb3e1124b9140ba2cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
