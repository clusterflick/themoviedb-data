The sights, sounds, and emotions they gather become the basis for their poetic compositions, evolving into plans that unfold through night-time chanting, imagination, and action. Collecting during the day and releasing their creations at night, their journey resembles an ancient visual fable. However, we never get to witness the various aspects of their daytime activities; instead, we can only see the diverse images projected through the words spoken during the night. As daylight is postponed, the endless night holds countless untold stories. Bound by it, the storytellers themselves become an integral part of the stories they narrate.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","title":"Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
