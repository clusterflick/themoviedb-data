Two dots are used as visual symbols of the relationship between these two opposites: one dot on the performer’s forehead (a symbol of the “inner eye”); the other on the screen representing an exterior “point of view.” Procedure: 1. I am dancing to music in front of a static camera. 2. I start the playback of the tape and try to stop the video image at a moment when one dot covers the other.
