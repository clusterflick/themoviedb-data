Set against iconic French cinema locations such as the climate-controlled vaults of the CNC and the Cinémathèque Française, the film traces each step of this meticulous process, from preservation to both mechanical and digital restoration at the Joinville-le-Pont laboratory. This technical and human journey highlights the craftsmanship involved and raises questions about the future of works that are not preserved on film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Few More Centuries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5831413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Martin-Dumazer","original_name":"Raphaël Martin-Dumazer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920e66b0b2936339621afab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FFD","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
