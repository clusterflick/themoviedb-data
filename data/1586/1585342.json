Troy begins what should be the brightest day of his career, but everything shifts when he learns his mother is in critical condition. As he races home, a fallen hourglass from his childhood pulls him into the memories and advice she left behind, reminding him to breathe and stay true to himself when life becomes overwhelming.  Through loss, family, and quiet reflection, Troy discovers how quickly a single moment can alter a life and how the smallest memories can carry the most weight. 10 Minutes captures the painful and beautiful truth that time can slip away, yet still leave echoes that stay with us.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/picoPyRyuQuWueyKn3MTx8fKVF5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":281118,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAAO
