The work's central issue is how systems promising progress trap the individual in a repetitive, hopeless loop of labor. This critique is materialized by replacing the original horse figure with a rat, symbolizing invisible labor and the struggle for survival within the consumption culture.  Executed via experimental Stop Motion, the piece is a short, ten-to-fifteen-second loop composed of 12 frames and edited with an aggressive, high-speed rhythm. This loop visually captures the futile struggle of the individual consuming the system's waste simply to survive. The work aims to challenge the viewer's limits of perception and prompt a reflection on existence reduced to a capitalist survival mechanism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This experimental video uses a rat in a 12-frame Stop Motion loop, structurally appropriating Muybridge, to critique the aggressive, futile cycle of discontinuous production and invisible labor in the Capitalist Order.","title":"The Experience of a Rat","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","original_name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6922057ee2104a20a3b741d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315135,"name":"rhythm"},{"id":362080,"name":"deconstruction"},{"id":362628,"name":"appropriation"},{"id":362629,"name":"limits of perception"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"Genel İzleyici Kitlesi","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
