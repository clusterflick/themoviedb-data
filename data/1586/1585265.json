Despite originating from disparate places, they are connected by the same land, history, and one person in particular. Through the personal journey of the filmmaker, who visits both the place where she grew up and the place her grandparents were forced to leave, the film forms a collage of encounters that challenge our contemporary memory culture and how we construct our narratives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Statues Rule the Waves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3897515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Isa Berhitu","original_name":"Noah Isa Berhitu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920d685c4d0adc2e05d63bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FFD","release_date":"2025-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
