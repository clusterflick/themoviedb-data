From the soccer field to the 2014 World Cup title, from celebrated symbol of integration to convicted perpetrator of intentional bodily harm against his ex-partner.  The documentary series looks behind the façade of professional soccer—a system that produces heroes but neglects people. It also addresses the question of how a soccer player is stylized into a role model by the media and society and burdened with excessive expectations.  Boateng's story is thus also one of false projections that encourages us to reflect on our treatment of and longing for sports idols: What do we want to see in them? Do soccer players have to be heroes?","popularity":0.1929,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being
