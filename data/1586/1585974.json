The constant barrage of information starts to glide past all of us.  We are neither here nor there. We try to distinguish fact from fabrication—but we do not always succeed. We ponder on our existence and whether we are in control of our lives. Some people dedicate their lives to the Creator although the presence of a higher power is debatable. We wander from emptiness to emptiness, and realise that life is emptiness in itself. A societal revolution is in order but how should it be carried out? With no success in sight, would the revolution be rendered meaningless? The melancholic musings and rants of the young gloomy leftists are rarely answerable.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deposition vol.3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
