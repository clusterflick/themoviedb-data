Safran compared their moral worldview to Jack Nicholson’s Colonel Jessep in A Few Good Men. Announced in January 2023 as part of the DCU slate, the film adapts the 1999 WildStorm team created by Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch, whose characters entered DC continuity in 2011 and were planned to be integrated into the new DC Universe. Gunn called the project a passion piece and initially planned to direct it, but by 2025 other priorities took over, the script struggled, the original (unannounced) writer departed, and Gunn even met with a TV creator as the project may shift from film to series. Gunn has also confirmed the story will connect to Superman.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1g0dT5u4tqqWwQkuDdZee9BSs69.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184898,"logo_path":"/iNTsbEgntSUwHmsZ9whiLhm60WB.png","name":"DC Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Authority","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Safran","original_name":"Peter Safran","popularity":0.7237,"profile_path":"/p9gR2taQgpt9FI8lMzZJXfOGrPy.jpg","credit_id":"692250cf5d44c8d5aa32a41e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Gunn","original_name":"James Gunn","popularity":2.8946,"profile_path":"/pnKqZub3IlKYbyH9RRTMDOoqEn0.jpg","credit_id":"692250e0549e857d2632a58b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Warren Ellis","original_name":"Warren Ellis","popularity":0.1615,"profile_path":"/wBaDI3Q4oCxNddqiHjuwah9Gmzv.jpg","credit_id":"6922511de47e0655870ba20b","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87171,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bryan Hitch","original_name":"Bryan Hitch","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6922513fcc8ad6c4ab32a3c2","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1g0dT5u4tqqWwQkuDdZee9BSs69.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
