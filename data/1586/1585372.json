After her father's death, Yu Xin discovers that he adopted a boy named Lin Si Liang. Driven by curiosity, Yu Xin decides to drive the Apollo 11 on one last space mission. When she reaches a desolate wasteland resembling the lunar surface, a strange boy's voice suddenly comes through her father's old radio. Just as the moon always shows the same face to the Earth, Yu Xin sees a different side of home.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ft10tKzeodrBA6H2Q0JpeKegKEJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2017-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apollo 11","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3239011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chih-Yin Chen","original_name":"陳稚尹","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69211e259ffc080535dd435f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6435800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"TW","iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/ft10tKzeodrBA6H2Q0JpeKegKEJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Golden Harvest Awards & Short Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
