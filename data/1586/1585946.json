Coming from a conservative home and background, Othmane wasn't prepared for adventure, and took very little with him on his 30000km journey, covering 24 countries. Othmane left home at just 20, and grew and matured - and perfected his camera skills - along the way. He also lived through some heartstopping moments, with a few arrests, three bouts of malaria, encounters with gunmen in the desert and countless punctures - Othmane quickly learned how to adapt and roll with whatever life threw his way.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":281210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Both Worlds Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2021-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa and I","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20224954","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
