Troubled by the damage to marine ecosystems and longing for the kind of silence not found in galleries or studios, Teguh created ARTificial Reef, an underwater sculpture that is both beautiful and functional as a home for coral and marine life. Told through a personal and contemplative narrative, the film explores a creative process that blends art, science, and spirituality. Teguh collaborates with divers, scientists, and coastal communities, showing that art thrives through connection and ecological awareness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bisikan Terumbu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3049044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arfan Sabran","original_name":"Arfan Sabran","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/w0Wyc4racBShacm4AgIBnHcH689.jpg","credit_id":"6920e2fcad0e5516ce2e3350","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FFD","release_date":"2025-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
