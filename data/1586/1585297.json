On one hand, she feels a deep responsibility to carry on the legacy of Inggi Kaliuda, a woven tradition passed down through generations. On the other hand, she harbors a strong desire to pursue higher education and carve out a different path for herself. Accompanied by her mother, Yustina (64), Merti goes from house to house, seeking handwoven cloths to sell. Through each conversation—about motifs, life stories, and cultural values—emerge questions of identity, sacrifice, and hope. Amid uncertainty, Merti chooses to stay with her mother, while quietly searching for new ways to find meaning in the place she calls home.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inggi: The Soul of Kaliuda Weaving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3495265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilianus U.
