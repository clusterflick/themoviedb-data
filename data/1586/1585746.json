Who decides what is Nature? Rehearsing the (*) Bathroom is an autoethnographic and speculative research project which contemplates the relationship between policy, memory, and the formation of identity, asserting the gendered public bathroom—specifically the men’s room—as a political tool and preconstructed space of certainty which quietly, yet forcefully, conditions and homogenizes the/my body. Embracing the abject, or what might be considered taboo, each video attempts to destabilize assumed codes and dominant socio-spatial structures within the space through somatic and cinematic representations of embodied memories, daily rituals, and fabulated scenarios.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rehearsing the (*) Bathroom: A Collection of Scenographic Studies","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Vaccaro","original_name":"John Vaccaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69220a76cc8ad6c4ab32a281","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alynna Gao","original_name":"Alynna Gao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"69220a84a999a1b00d32a315","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Vaccaro","original_name":"John Vaccaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"692208ee024a642dbd32a34e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alynna Gao","original_name":"Alynna Gao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69220a0c3ed0e918ad958608","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikki Apostolidis","original_name":"Nikki Apostolidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69220a1f289e1ba762186c95","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudia Ng","original_name":"Claudia Ng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69220a41cef5c0cb277686fc","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5833054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Vaccaro","original_name":"John Vaccaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69220a585dd266090095853f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
