Synthesized is a murderous twisted romance, scored by classic Synth from the early 80's about Martyn [Thomas Turgoose] a man out of time who loves his wife Valkyrie, computers and Synthesizers, which he plays in pubs and clubs to unappreciative audiences. But when Val does him wrong and Martyn's life starts to fall apart he retreats into his music, hoping to calm his inner turmoil.  But music can summon the dark as well as soothe the soul, and it's not long before Martyn is hitting more than just the keys on his Synthesizer keyboard.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synthesized","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Turgoose","original_name":"Thomas Turgoose","popularity":0.7646,"profile_path":"/3PsCUvclNzVrjDGg69Q3blw83ei.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6920ce1a66f9f7c798c2d7c4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134900,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Green","original_name":"Chris Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6920cea66c8d02ba0021af57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37751146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
