Other floats: Wittenberg traditional costumes and the float of the \"Union Club,\" a social club famous for its choir, which still exists today. The animals line up for the awards ceremony at the \"Finsterloh\" fairground near Büblingshausen to be judged by a jury (in the background). On the grandstand: Wetzlar's haute volée of the time. There are two versions of this film, which was later edited, shortened, and re-scored by Paul Görnert: the longer version has poorer image quality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ochsenfest / Tierschaufest in Wetzlar 2. und 3.
