While serving in a segregated military, Black men and women do much of the U.S. Army's \"heavy lifting\" by day, and introduce the British population to jazz, jitterbugging and Black American culture by night. For the first time, Black American soldiers experience what it is like to be treated as equals and as Americans.t","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Choc'late Soldiers from the USA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855486,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noel Izon","original_name":"Noel Izon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe35f4931644b0040f5b608","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2797218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
