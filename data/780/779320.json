It was hard to leave the little tot and the husband vainly straggling against the relentless tide of invincible circumstance. In the lonesome night the child prays for the mother-woman, and across the dreary waste of desert life she hears the call, and heeds. The telepathic tie that binds the child's mind to her own transmits the wistful message, and the mother-heart conquers. The nebulous shadow of night and blight departs; the withered hope buds and blooms anew, and she takes the narrow path back to those to whom her life is consecrated.","popularity":0.1213,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fe4c116c7176d003e736fab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362368,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanner E.V.
