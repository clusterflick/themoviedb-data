The film focuses on the lead character, Kyleena, who portrays an emotionally, psychologically, physically, and spiritually abused woman of bi-racial beauty, ethnicity and poor parental conditioning. The film shows how Kyleena finds herself in a third marriage with a man, Alex, who has advertised himself to be a straight and holy man of God.
