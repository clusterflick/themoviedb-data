It was made for people to see after they've watched the movie itself, therefore containing/revealing spoilers as to how certain characters die, as well as the identity of the killer. The piece seeks to gain insight from writer/director, Glen Morgan on the whys and hows of not only re-making a popular cult classic, but how it fits within his own career. Filmed fly on the wall-style, the featurette mainly covers Morgan's struggle, for good or for worse, to make his film commercially popular while still trying to include elements like a theme and tone in what is essentially a slasher horror movie. The theme of \"family\" permeates throughout the movie, but also behind-the-screen as well.","popularity":1.5262,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May All Your Christmases Be Black","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Cassidy","original_name":"Katie Cassidy","popularity":1.8978,"profile_path":"/v7cs7RFcfoiL8W1YRkZK5lBc57H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626d1014d7107e2aa28a238f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lacey Chabert","original_name":"Lacey Chabert","popularity":3.6905,"profile_path":"/lYRtX2k8A1Y52IQdpKS9Louaf1j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626d10542ac499004fe22725","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Cloke","original_name":"Kristen Cloke","popularity":0.3591,"profile_path":"/9MTNs9kMX6OTR6SJwMkwG3EVTsN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"626d10772ac4990064325f56","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":75878,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Joann Fowler","original_name":"Joann Fowler","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"herself","credit_id":"626d1089eec4f31197c95224","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12706,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mark S.
