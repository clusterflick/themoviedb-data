Ludovic Moreau is a geophysicist who seeks to unravel this mystery: why does the ice pack melt faster than in the forecasts? To conduct this investigation, he travels with five scientists near the North Pole, in Svalbard Norway. On a frozen lake they put seismic sensors to record the song of the ice. A song that may help break the secret of the ice pack and its decline.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uPyQvdvbmNZLWNTBGh1tOb5Cbcc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146174,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riddim Production","origin_country":""},{"id":146175,"logo_path":null,"name":"MBLIVE TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ice Flow Requiem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Ice Flow Requiem","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Το τραγούδι του πάγου","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Larose","original_name":"Eric Larose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404a90567dcc900826e9267","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Larose","original_name":"Eric Larose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404a98f3927120086189f57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Larose","original_name":"Eric Larose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404a96e39271200d03566f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionel Cariou","original_name":"Lionel Cariou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3b914b2e074004074d708","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionel Cariou","original_name":"Lionel Cariou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3b91acee481003f259def","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907533,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marc de Langenhagen","original_name":"Marc de Langenhagen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3b9d18a0e9b003d0b70b0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907531,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Margaux Mugnier","original_name":"Margaux Mugnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe3b9abeb79c2003f45c86a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uPyQvdvbmNZLWNTBGh1tOb5Cbcc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kM80RG8e0Fyj9wWpNAnkFgmzcR6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
