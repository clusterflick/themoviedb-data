Embarking on a four month long journey, she traveled over 2000 kilometers on foot from her native town of Strasbourg, France, meeting pilgrims from across the world along the road and asking them what made them go on this adventure. Whether it was a desire to reconnect with their inner selves, a desire to challenge themselves, or even as a spiritual quest : every path is unique.  This documentary discusses a generation of pilgrims and their needs to review their everyday habits, to discover the unknown and experiencing the magic of life.","popularity":1.083,"poster_path":"/h7behVNhHOpYrEbR5W8bznBZY7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146315,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Passe à L'acte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chemins de vie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Chemins de Vie : Marcher vers son Essentiel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Wald","original_name":"Pauline Wald","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5fe7d362c7176d003f79e1a5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Wald","original_name":"Pauline Wald","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7d390cee481003e2d5c09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Wald","original_name":"Pauline Wald","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7d3b0489d0000409adb7d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911464,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Xavier Cailhol","original_name":"Xavier Cailhol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7d430cf1afd003a845138","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911465,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandre Sattler","original_name":"Alexandre Sattler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7d44b66565a003bd9ce0a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Manolo Moreno Comes","original_name":"Manolo Moreno Comes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7d45bcee48100402e354f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2911459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Wald","original_name":"Pauline Wald","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7d4785b1240003e691bca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"PaulineAcrossTheWorlds","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lVSb70mCGaC7urrZboXAALIHGLG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/h7behVNhHOpYrEbR5W8bznBZY7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2628,"name":"site of pilgrimage"},{"id":5864,"name":"pilgrimage"},{"id":8008,"name":"pilgrim"},{"id":4792,"name":"mental control"},{"id":182651,"name":"life changing"},{"id":220025,"name":"drastic change of life"},{"id":234765,"name":"semi-biographical"},{"id":240461,"name":"dedication"},{"id":278696,"name":"saint-jacques-de-compostelle"},{"id":286690,"name":"mental break"},{"id":295812,"name":"testimony"},{"id":332850,"name":"santiago de compostela"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VOD","release_date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prime Video","release_date":"2022-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chemins de Vie, Marcher vers son Essentiel / Bande-annonce 2","key":"coCvnW2OwyY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-10T10:00:13.000Z","id":"5fe7d2da160e73003cb03584"}]}}}
