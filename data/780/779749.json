Comedian buddies. Actors who dreamed of the Conservatory and the National Theater of Paris. The theater was their ideal, cinema will be their paradise. Their friend Jean-Paul Belmondo, the relaxed Parisian, who failed the entrance exam, will make sparks fly. Rochefort, Marielle and Noiret, the three provincials, will climb the steps of recognition one by one. From the little cabarets on the Left Bank to the TV shows of the Buttes-Chaumont pioneers. From the second roles to the first and from the B movies to the classics.","popularity":0.5168,"poster_path":"/6iFD5TPcozZXYUgfJKDFVfU1ydR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48098,"logo_path":"/fWIaTm5r2j6WHgatBFLn1ioZxSB.png","name":"Roche Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rochefort, Marielle, Noiret: Les copains d'abord","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","popularity":0.4033,"profile_path":"/yrCA8WtOZUwzY5EK0kmlEpgBgid.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6766f5d667df86d984748c30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Rochefort","original_name":"Jean Rochefort","popularity":0.5365,"profile_path":"/wyvdO0ih9mwLE3UHCy8GudqnKTK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6766f5e567df86d984748c64","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Noiret","original_name":"Philippe Noiret","popularity":0.8195,"profile_path":"/f5DsqdoLxQnPMrOTMkm6dIHNyEs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6766f5ef67df86d984748c6d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Forneri","original_name":"Pascal Forneri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe7017ccee48100402c9f19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2282277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Aymé","original_name":"François Aymé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe70190c7176d003f784da0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Forneri","original_name":"Pascal Forneri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe701b466565a003dd8b853","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13719600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b43ZBNwWnkyUPCvoYZ5a7EEyhIF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1917,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6iFD5TPcozZXYUgfJKDFVfU1ydR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1745,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rTIxMLr142U4NLlTYMPJ67xmw9r.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1165},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1745,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9vpcuqKNXlsPtuIbZvdSzXN8q5r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1165}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184233,"name":"theater troupe"},{"id":213803,"name":"french cinema"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":230202,"name":"theater community"},{"id":235894,"name":"theater performance"},{"id":263589,"name":"the world of theater"},{"id":268040,"name":"academic theater"},{"id":328788,"name":"film making"},{"id":345472,"name":"french actor"},{"id":345473,"name":"famous actor"},{"id":345513,"name":"biographical"},{"id":345747,"name":"biographical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Une","release_date":"2020-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RTS Deux","release_date":"2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
