Once celebrated as a progressive visionary, McInnes' transformation into a radical right-wing provocateur stunned the world and left many old colleagues and friends questioning how the, once, coolest man in New York City became the despised leader of the Proud boys. In a high-stakes quest for truth, his former Vice Magazine protégé embarks on a journey into the heart of darkness, determined to unravel the twisted transformation that his mentor and friend underwent. This documentary delves deep into the psyche of a man who defied expectations, exposing the raw, unfiltered journey of a counterculture icon who became the leader and figurehead of an extremist, violent movement that shook the foundations of democracy.","popularity":0.0978,"poster_path":"/3zMY5lQGWe6qGswvpq5eF6DfNUC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84152,"logo_path":"/sOoLx8W96TZgvS10u91n9OTr3Fc.png","name":"Urbania Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":202726,"logo_path":"/rp1SqYgTUbsmK5xKvxT0kYuUode.png","name":"Connect3 Media","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Not Funny Anymore: Vice to Proud Boys","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin McInnes","original_name":"Gavin McInnes","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/waOzoNz25iYpMYOPQZLWCsH7yZX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"672040c11ea33928297dda0f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3097833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Trahan","original_name":"Sébastien Trahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f587427bd57d91f631f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3097833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Trahan","original_name":"Sébastien Trahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f588e27bd57d91f631f77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3483958,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laurel Baker","original_name":"Laurel Baker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f58b31ea33928297db42d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33818886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ug9CfBCsY6Nrlh2M1elCi9uQc4W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3zMY5lQGWe6qGswvpq5eF6DfNUC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":340921,"name":"proud boys"},{"id":340922,"name":"american extremism"},{"id":340923,"name":"vice media empire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"internet","release_date":"2024-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
