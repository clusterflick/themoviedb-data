A guest, somewhat flustered by the petulance of his fair companion whom he has slightly offended, departs without a roll of bills from which he paid his check. Smith hurriedly tucks the money in his pocket, and when the guest comes back denies he has seen the roll. The head waiter searches him, finds the money, returns it to the owner, and discharges Smith. The waiter breaks the sad news to his wife, who is waiting for him with their little child in an atmosphere of poverty, owing to the fact that Smith's petty dishonesties deprive him of employment. Mrs. Smith, with the baby in her arms, hurries to the restaurant and pleads with the head waiter to give her husband another chance, but he refuses. A wealthy patron, Mr. Randall, and his handsomely gowned wife overhear the plea, and the rich woman's sympathies are aroused.","popularity":0.0702,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Till Death Do Us Part","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kirkwood","original_name":"James Kirkwood","popularity":0.279,"profile_path":"/svL7O0IG1wHWXr9BUIolCWkKeeN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Smith","credit_id":"5fe4bdcc70309f003e818a67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Leonard","original_name":"Marion Leonard","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/ftSUgK4P92cPUOMGl3LLeFbdBan.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fe4bdd7f14dad003bcee3bd","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0467082","wikidata_id":"Q111598986","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1911-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
