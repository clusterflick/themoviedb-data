In 2012, 17 year old Sophie Harvey suffered trauma by a clueless school administration solely because she was an introvert. Comedy-as-therapy - IGTHS - is a farcical improv movie about the inherent bias against introverts. Created by an inclusive, diverse cast and crew, led by a team of women and non-binary department heads, IGTHS was made by and for people who care about changing how we treat misunderstood youth. Seven years in the making. Creative contributions from introverts all over the internet. Sophie still doesn't want to talk about it.","popularity":0.5293,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Introvert's Guide to High School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laine MacNeil","original_name":"Laine MacNeil","popularity":0.4318,"profile_path":"/sGOn7vLF5WwuqBPieml5sJtu1mU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"5fe4734070309f003f817665","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2411261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Schimmer","original_name":"Samantha Schimmer","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/3NqOdbn7f3BP5gRjbg35g6X38Ib.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amber","credit_id":"5fe473401d6c5f0044db6ead","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Sarah Stone","original_name":"Julia Sarah Stone","popularity":0.2688,"profile_path":"/6PV9ZU6Xv7w1N2Pb8R9t9V9pIIa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ava","credit_id":"5fe47341160e73003fa98012","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Talalay","original_name":"Lucy Talalay","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jade","credit_id":"5fe473411ac292003db86c62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2298634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Tao","original_name":"Julie Tao","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/dVn2nlvNoUoWjyD8Os5FvZNt5W0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chelsea","credit_id":"5fe473411ac292003db86c65","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Talalay","original_name":"Rachel Talalay","popularity":0.3137,"profile_path":"/2R8t47gW1tLAG1ZNl13pTpi6YYl.jpg","credit_id":"61adfd8aaa659e001cb5a5b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1939516,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Avery Holliday","original_name":"Avery Holliday","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/nH4jz3SuvcHUrdzz2RKJgTQQljc.jpg","credit_id":"5fe885289cc67b003d5d7498","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1706503,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Catherine Capozzi","original_name":"Catherine Capozzi","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":"/57GVGz7UDMHeyI7DCdYcJwnIoyT.jpg","credit_id":"5fe884e9c9dbf9003d48a7af","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Harvey","original_name":"Sophie Harvey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe885111d3563003dda818f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Harvey","original_name":"Sophie Harvey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe88504c7176d003d7a2b12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Talalay","original_name":"Rachel Talalay","popularity":0.3137,"profile_path":"/2R8t47gW1tLAG1ZNl13pTpi6YYl.jpg","credit_id":"5fe8851cc7176d003e797573","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13695024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer: An Introvert's Guide To High School","key":"463146496","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-29T18:09:21.000Z","id":"6088be81b6abc400784b5496"}]}}}
