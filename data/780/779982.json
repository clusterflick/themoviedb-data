It looks at the history of anarchism in the UK and beyond, as well as the state of the movement in the tumultuous year the poll tax uprising finally led to the resignation of Thatcher. Among the anarchist heavyweights interviewed are Albert Meltzer, Vernon Richards, Vi Subversa, Philip Sansom, Clifford Harper and Nicholas Walter, as well as a host of lesser known but equally committed dissidents. The film also features the miners strike and class struggle, squatting and social centres such as Bradford's 1in12 club, animal rights and feminism.","popularity":0.3481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldsmiths' College","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dare to Dream: Anarchism in England in History and in Action","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Meltzer","original_name":"Albert Meltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself - Anarchist historian","credit_id":"5fe87011cf1afd003a85b2ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chumbawamba","original_name":"Chumbawamba","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Themselves - Performers","credit_id":"5fe8703ee74146003e39aeb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Richards","original_name":"Vernon Richards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Anarchist historian","credit_id":"5fe87064c7176d003d7a07e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2917007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Walter","original_name":"Nicolas Walter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Anarchist Historian","credit_id":"5fecc1ea002134003d9b476a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3106069,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jim Rowland","original_name":"Jim Rowland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b098775b0714002967fdea","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2536661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sabrina Burnard","original_name":"Sabrina Burnard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b098d78ee49c0029843b6b","department":"Sound","job":"Assistant Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3106077,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roazanne Lipschitz","original_name":"Roazanne Lipschitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b099348ee49c0029843b86","department":"Sound","job":"Assistant Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marianne Jenkins","original_name":"Marianne Jenkins","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe87095cf1afd003b857b9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13716206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":5879,"name":"anarchist"},{"id":9898,"name":"animal rights"},{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":165259,"name":"political unrest"},{"id":227148,"name":"anarchism"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
