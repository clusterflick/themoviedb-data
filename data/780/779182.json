Produced in 1986 by the Seattle Children's Theatre, the original stage musical \"Snow and the Family Dwarf\" was a smashing success, playing to more than 20,000 people. This movie version, using most of the original stage cast, was photographed on location throughout the Pacific Northwest -- in the forests of the North Cascades, on the Skykomish River, and in the stately mansions of Seattle. The result is a stunning achievement: a retelling with some delightful surprises for even the most devoted fans of the original tale.","popularity":0.2244,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Snow and the Family Dwarf","type":"Play title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annajo Trowbridge","original_name":"Annajo Trowbridge","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Snow","credit_id":"5fe427ba3a4a12003ff24682","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Christian","original_name":"Edward Christian","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Howie Dwarf / Elroy","credit_id":"5fe427ee1d6c5f003fdb5037","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Lee","original_name":"Jeanne Lee","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Peg Dwarf","credit_id":"5fe427fe8a0e9b003d0c4ccf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sena Merril","original_name":"Sena Merril","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jean Louise Dwarf","credit_id":"5fe4281070309f003d805801","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2907999,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill Stainton","original_name":"Bill Stainton","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Magician","credit_id":"5fe428230d417e003c4f3ecb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Floyd Van Buskirk","original_name":"Floyd Van Buskirk","popularity":0.2064,"profile_path":"/nKmecyzuI0Ijb9jCzpKT3THHQOo.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Roy Dwarf","credit_id":"5fe428340d417e003b4efe67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Platt","original_name":"Peggy Platt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Rose Dwarf","credit_id":"5fe42847eb79c2003e473d1f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas R.
