Break explores the transmuting relationship of ice and water in the north Atlantic off Iceland's coast, through varying shots of a single act: glacial ice fragments violently struck by breaking waves in a stormy ocean. Images and field recordings of the ocean's relentless force paired with Spiegel's unsettling, otherworldly score evoke the troubling effects of an unseen human presence. Break is a meditation on the passage of time and fragility of matter. With powerful imagery and sound, its visual commentary alludes to inexorable loss and dissolution and infers the implications of a changing climate in the far north, and beyond.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Break","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4075928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
