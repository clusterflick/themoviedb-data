It is a safe neighborhood, where people know and greet each other. Everybody has their own backyard; single car garages are lining the narrow footpaths and everything is groomed. But for some time now that peacefulness is troubled, because refugees are supposed to move in next door. As some of the residents are afraid of the noise to be expected, they are putting up a noise protection wall. Biotope shows the life of the locals and gets to the bottom of the reason for building that wall.","popularity":0.1604,"poster_path":"/yapUKV5BNCh8rCcJ5EMCRaeiReN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biotope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3341573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Scholten","original_name":"Paul Scholten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b1efb733ad8f008a589be9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3341573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Scholten","original_name":"Paul Scholten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b1efa4da9ef20043eb0c97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10136038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"biotopdocumentary","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yapUKV5BNCh8rCcJ5EMCRaeiReN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmschau Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg","release_date":"2018-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
