Tranquil scenes of unassuming neighborhoods near Burlington International Airport are juxtaposed with voicemails of the unheard, those drowned out by the ear-shattering “sound of freedom.” Exploring the relationship between picturesque residential areas and the deafening fighter jets overhead, Jet Line is a poetic portrait of a community plagued by war machines, documenting untenable conditions in a small city once voted one of the best places to live in America.","popularity":0.3547,"poster_path":"/2IJqqUSyxpO2iXpeQE7VgZvDmre.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Voicemails from the Flight Path","title":"Jet Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3341983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick McCormack","original_name":"Patrick McCormack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b260235800c400424b9045","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duane Peterson III","original_name":"Duane Peterson III","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b2602d7ac829004383150f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2IJqqUSyxpO2iXpeQE7VgZvDmre.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9878,"name":"fighter jet"},{"id":156799,"name":"vermont"},{"id":162365,"name":"military"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":288832,"name":"burlington"},{"id":288833,"name":"winooski"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jet Line: Voicemails from the Flight Path (2021)","key":"537513715","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-16T00:38:31.000Z","id":"61b260bb6dea3a0089b67942"}]}}}
