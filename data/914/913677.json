Today they have returned after many years in prison, and they try, each one of them, to recount their own experiences. They speak about the political reasons which initially sustained them, the conflicts, the doubts, and the moments of being torn apart which market out their lives as women caught up in the vortex of war. A course of events which ended in the condemnation of the armed struggle and the pain of the lives that were destroyed – their victims’ lives and their own.","popularity":0.2519,"poster_path":"/voNc7YdslC0uB7EAmKk53Aubhas.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wallonie Image
