This offbeat film narrated by Rob Brydon takes us to the Wild West where prairie dogs live in huge colonies known as 'towns'. Like meerkats, they are comical to watch, but there is a whole lot more to prairie dogs than just being cute - they can talk. For 30 years Professor Con Slobodchikoff has been recording their calls in response to predators like coyotes, hawks and badgers. He believes he has discovered a language second only to humans in its complexity. It's a bold claim but is he right? Con has devised a series of cunning field experiments to help prove his point.","popularity":0.3145,"poster_path":"/6EiAMg7VKs2t7Ny1izgmVO95dmG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prairie Dogs: Talk of the Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Brydon","original_name":"Rob Brydon","popularity":1.0649,"profile_path":"/xoKLZVwzaUgTUEvPX4vymXpC1fU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b1f6bbaf85de008ff906b4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dunleavy","original_name":"Stephen Dunleavy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b1f6996dea3a0060ae1b7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1597689","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":822,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6EiAMg7VKs2t7Ny1izgmVO95dmG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
