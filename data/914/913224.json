There are show-offs and singers, dancers and fighters, stories of undercover affairs and heartwarming devotion. These include a male polar bear that plays hard to get, a lemur whose odour bags him a mate and a lizard who is tender and faithful to the very end. It reveals that animals can be loving, complex, funny and inventive - it is all part of the mating game.","popularity":0.4161,"poster_path":"/e7IOjoM3k0lHOwCIrZ1QqgYfrPF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mating Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Attenborough","original_name":"David Attenborough","popularity":1.4236,"profile_path":"/tt3LW3XftcvxOZtMXmIaJSWFN7y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61b0cf67699fb7001ceaabdf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barnaby Taylor","original_name":"Barnaby Taylor","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/shZLr3hoFP0Bl8GtNo9JtejED86.jpg","credit_id":"649d25633e6f2b00ad172539","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346412,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Fletcher","original_name":"Mark Fletcher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/AdMdRzj4kMKTLlJoVHk06tj9e1H.jpg","credit_id":"649d256f091e6200cadfe821","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346412,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Fletcher","original_name":"Mark Fletcher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/AdMdRzj4kMKTLlJoVHk06tj9e1H.jpg","credit_id":"649d257bc072a2014faecae8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241963,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Cole","original_name":"Chris Cole","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649d25823e6f2b00e2dd2748","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113833,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Coster","original_name":"Matt Coster","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649d25a7c9dbf900e8efb0de","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2442414,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Gorst","original_name":"Kate Gorst","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649d25b35aba3200e2feb548","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3560660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":824,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7IOjoM3k0lHOwCIrZ1QqgYfrPF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
