The arrival of a circus tent just outside his apartment prompts him to consider the history and legacy of the freak show, in which individuals who were deemed atypical were put on display for the amusement and shock of a paying public. Contemplating how this relates to his own filmmaking practice, which explicitly foregrounds disability, Davenport sets out to make a film about how he sees the world from his wheelchair without having to be seen himself.","popularity":0.5336,"poster_path":"/fkoT9aNqCicwG8IDN3JrikEFzKM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128976,"logo_path":"/6ZfJiskmTdzvYs8861ynrFNMSzk.png","name":"XTR","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms
