Their destinies developed differently – the tragic death of Soprovsky, the forced emigration of Kenzheev and Tsvetkov, the throwing of Gandlevsky only strengthened their \"union\" through the years and distances. Today they are not only a legend of Moscow, but also one of the best poets of our time both in Russia and abroad, every year they come to Moscow to meet again and see their fans and admirers of real poetry.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hRKi0ElH1l06Cav625nXDjNxXHG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moscow Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3340722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatiana Ilyina","original_name":"Tatiana Ilyina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b0feb0e2ff3200a123c2b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hRKi0ElH1l06Cav625nXDjNxXHG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
