Five kids, alone and bored at their parents' house, decide to play this game. They place five little papers in a bowl, one of them has 'seeker' written on it, another has the word 'seryo' and the other three just say 'neutral.' These papers are mixed, each child grabs one and the game begins. The seeker begins his search with his eyes on a fold. Slowly, he starts finding his friends and perhaps something else.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rpsKUCZCA874v9wLl5zcHF6iAyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SERYO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3341964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rocío Rubio Roman","original_name":"Rocío Rubio Roman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b25bbfda9ef2001d371ca4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7913356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rpsKUCZCA874v9wLl5zcHF6iAyt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":933}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
