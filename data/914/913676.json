There he meets Athos, Portos and Aramis, with whom he later forms a warm friendship. Captain of the Women's Regiment De Treville, of course, in such an environment weaves intrigue and gossip. In the French capital d'Artagnan finds his first love, Constance Bonassier. Queen Anne of Austria constantly presses King Louis XIII of France to lead a healthy lifestyle, forcing himto do one or another sport. The King, being of a poetic nature who prefers a bohemian way of life, opposes this in every possible way. The Queen then embarks on an affair with Lord Buckingham. The main enemy of all the heroes is the insidious Cardinal Madame Richelieu.","popularity":0.2327,"poster_path":"/r42l1q6HjfuWhBVqdivyDqbfsxY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151149,"logo_path":null,"name":"Melorama
