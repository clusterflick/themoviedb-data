Old friends such as Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens), Pete Townshend of The Who, Joe Walsh of The Eagles, Jon Lord of Deep Purple, Gary Moore, Dennis Locorriere of Dr Hook and of course his Traffic colleague Steve Winwood, were joined by younger admirers such as Paul Weller and The Storys to perform their favourite Traffic and Jim Capaldi tracks in front of a sell out audience. The evening was hosted by broadcasting legend \"Whispering\" Bob Harris.","popularity":1.0154,"poster_path":"/s29pUaoURzSPDbSUxJGcLhKJZn5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Mr. Fantasy - A Celebration for Jim Capaldi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Winwood","original_name":"Steve Winwood","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/sqgzPJ3RTZmmlfI5VKvFrRPi2j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636ce56181383100b510c800","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat Stevens","original_name":"Cat Stevens","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/7NmczpBadFXRQcSIu4yskfaUev2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (as Yusuf Islam)","credit_id":"636ce57dd7fbda00905cbb4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Townshend","original_name":"Pete Townshend","popularity":0.4168,"profile_path":"/juqxP6G6O7i4bOHuIwdyVHNyHME.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636ce58f81383100dd35b82e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Moore","original_name":"Gary Moore","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/fIwBJYdsvx7e2yJsUds32gAYyrp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636ce59d81383100abf530b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Walsh","original_name":"Joe Walsh","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/2cihrXQeODd0JiYd78IVu9whHW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636ce5a981383100dd35b83f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weller","original_name":"Paul Weller","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/3dOUHcW9YM9JBlkpPjdXJ1hdmON.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636ce5b6f14dad007b25e958","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Lord","original_name":"Jon Lord","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/jgC2AryDfFoWULtaBlEObe9TCkx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636ce5c981383100b510c822","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aXxDuehWRoAOhsVYmX67wKczbBY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s29pUaoURzSPDbSUxJGcLhKJZn5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
