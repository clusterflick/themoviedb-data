You don’t really know why. It lies around, and then one day you open it, almost absentmindedly. And there you are, facing your own innermost secrets.”  So begins Stan Neumann’s cinematic adaptation of W.G. Sebald’s award-winning novel, Austerlitz. The vaulted and majestic space of the railway station in Antwerp is where our journey really starts with actor Denis Lavant (Holy Motors) addressing the camera directly, and musing on the curious nature of railway stations. This bravura opening is startling, charming, and like the unnamed narrator of the book, you surrender to the proceedings and perambulate alongside Lavant, as he journeys through the great buildings of Europe, faded and shuttered hotels and grand colonnades with broken windows.","popularity":0.2406,"poster_path":"/An9YbiZOPR73aQLT3wU8LYS8sw0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11246,"logo_path":"/4YZ5CQZkJa2FIKGtjLLoKhNOAIw.png","name":"La Région Île-de-France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Austerlitz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Lavant","original_name":"Denis Lavant","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/WgGsHm3IC6ocjmjslREvKKNnX3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jacques Austerlitz","credit_id":"613cba9aaaf8970062b6988e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxane Duran","original_name":"Roxane Duran","popularity":0.4594,"profile_path":"/zwti3l3qLSpkfPDECupl99y9jbo.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Marie de Verneuil","credit_id":"613cbaa36af9dd0091786278","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1932322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viera Pavlíková","original_name":"Viera Pavlíková","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/wokIIDT0HV5o2R6AvpewhYarGka.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Vera (as Vera Pavlíková)","credit_id":"613cbaac60c751008d842ede","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3230535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominique Pifarély","original_name":"Dominique Pifarély","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Le musicien","credit_id":"613cbab66af9dd004374abee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronika Výprachtická","original_name":"Veronika Výprachtická","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"La vendeuse","credit_id":"613cbac15258ae0044ae1609","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karol Laburda","original_name":"Karol Laburda","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Le gardien","credit_id":"613cbac96af9dd004374ac12","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Neumann","original_name":"Stan Neumann","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613cb63b9653f6002b8b7f53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3230532,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.
