However, as Ruth fears that her granddaughter, who prefers to change her car tires rather than make herself beautiful in front of the mirror, gets drowsy at some point, she secretly makes a personal announcement in Marie's name. Without a photo of her beautiful granddaughter, nobody can even get married even in times of the internet. Ruth hires the professional photographer Niklas, who succeeds in the miracle: Marie is kissing awake. In the role of a modern Cinderella Mira Bartuschek discovers her femininity and Kai Schumann as her photographer the motif of his life.","popularity":0.3867,"poster_path":"/7DV05du6onfIR3Qm2C8m22WArnn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utta Danella - Wachgeküsst","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mira Bartuschek","original_name":"Mira Bartuschek","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/vFQdIvvpmsqmJK5ZKO1UMKS3c8n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marie Rosinger","credit_id":"554fbda89251413e40005d70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1061877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidelinde Weis","original_name":"Heidelinde Weis","popularity":0.2919,"profile_path":"/uGaEA1b1pnrrMzRhZ6g3gbVEsBv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ruth Rosinger","credit_id":"554fbdb5c3a3687f63002693","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Hartwig","original_name":"Janina Hartwig","popularity":0.2081,"profile_path":"/eFUsUZEfVq3W5sTnIsUqaryL3EU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carla Rosinger","credit_id":"554fbdc89251416984004fae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Rauch","original_name":"Siegfried Rauch","popularity":0.3726,"profile_path":"/zciVfVyQmiVQ2c9uOEZ84kKdnqN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Johann Wedel","credit_id":"554fbdd59251413e40005d76","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Schumann","original_name":"Kai Schumann","popularity":0.2552,"profile_path":"/rj0XffLC3ubUVywrsLtfV9vp3wQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Niklas Steinke","credit_id":"59900258c3a36874c40274fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Friedrich","original_name":"Daniel Friedrich","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/oRALtu3S5RdkVOwOXhITg9HlKWs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Prof. Peter Blumfeld","credit_id":"599002729251416723026bc0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Hoecke","original_name":"Susan Hoecke","popularity":0.3461,"profile_path":"/bvHpfYG12OyGTg3HLZJA8UjYy81.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"599002829251416739025a04","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Gruber","original_name":"Martin Gruber","popularity":0.3332,"profile_path":"/dxytHpxVBxcBo9m4vIWFD6dmy05.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ronald Schönauer","credit_id":"59900291925141675f026172","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Knechtl","original_name":"Susanna Knechtl","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/3mCDCFo80bfW7cFLypFuyYIwAvd.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"5990029fc3a3687461024d3d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1868741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sascha Heymans","original_name":"Sascha Heymans","popularity":0.0624,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"599002b2925141670b027422","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Krach","original_name":"Sarah Krach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Vroni","credit_id":"599002bcc3a36874930240dc","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Oertel","original_name":"Sophia Oertel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Kitty","credit_id":"599002c99251416723026c35","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":24155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Behrens","original_name":"Gloria Behrens","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554fbd999251416984004faa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1914108","wikidata_id":"Q62274341","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.761,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7DV05du6onfIR3Qm2C8m22WArnn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
