It marked the end of a very prolific phase of actions that followed the legendary Art and Revolution action by the Viennese Actionists in Vienna in 1968. As a result of this performance, Muehl and Günter Brus were prosecuted and could no longer exhibit publicly in Austria.","popularity":0.167,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":105794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viennese Actionism","origin_country":""},{"id":106121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kölnischer Kunstverein","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1970-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manopsychotisches Ballett","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1466077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romilla Doll","original_name":"Romilla Doll","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5551106c9251417123002143","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1466078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mica Most","original_name":"Mica Most","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5551107ac3a36840a10021eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Muehl","original_name":"Otto Muehl","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dryBVaK9qV7NCoGX4FYrYKXM8jk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55511097c3a3684191000f5e","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1466079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Stumpfl","original_name":"Herbert Stumpfl","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"555110a8c3a368426f002371","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Moorman","original_name":"Charlotte Moorman","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":"/m204NJpTSr4WVw5NRvDz56HTiHb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cello","credit_id":"5b35bd7a0e0a263ff802657b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Siegert","original_name":"Jörg Siegert","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"555110dc9251416eba0005f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Muehl","original_name":"Otto Muehl","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dryBVaK9qV7NCoGX4FYrYKXM8jk.jpg","credit_id":"555110e7c3a368436d001008","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074467,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jörg Siebert","original_name":"Jörg Siebert","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b35bf909251413c7402927d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Balthasar Burkhard","original_name":"Balthasar Burkhard","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b35bf570e0a26400a029351","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Muehl","original_name":"Otto Muehl","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dryBVaK9qV7NCoGX4FYrYKXM8jk.jpg","credit_id":"5b35bdcec3a3685311025d73","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter Brus","original_name":"Günter Brus","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xksyEdp7UL3oCim5NyF18ay9B0O.jpg","credit_id":"5b35bde49251413ca601d4a1","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2342416,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Siegert","original_name":"Michael Siegert","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0a7a890e0a267ffbcd1aa5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2342415,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Harald Frisch","original_name":"Harald Frisch","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0a7a7192514121aeb85a58","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Siegert","original_name":"Jörg Siegert","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0a7a7dc3a368474a1f5a5c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0983893","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14778,"name":"urination"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":33442,"name":"feces"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
