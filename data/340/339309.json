They show their families, their toys, and their celebrations with grace and lightheartedness. We meet the characters that make up their everyday world - from baby chickens to the village chief - and we see the children helping with chores, learning to hunt, going to school and playing games. Often comparing and contrasting themselves to earlier generations, they are aware of their cultural heritage and how it has changed since their grandparents' time. Engaging and candid, the Ikpeng children are full of curiosity and ask that people of other cultures send their own video-letters.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/dLnfN64rCMipSCFoJmnAnCte3Tr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vídeo nas Aldeias","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Ikpeng Children to the World","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Marangmotxingmo Mirang - Das Crianças Ikpeng Para o Mundo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"From The Ikpeng Youth To The World","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karané Txicão","original_name":"Karané Txicão","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554c84129251413faa001528","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kumaré Txicão","original_name":"Kumaré Txicão","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554c8427925141405600151e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natuyu Yuwipo Txicão","original_name":"Natuyu Yuwipo Txicão","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554c843b925141400b0013fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0362847","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dLnfN64rCMipSCFoJmnAnCte3Tr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
