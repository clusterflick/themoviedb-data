Henri Langlois was one of the co-founders of the Cinematheque Francaise, a museum which contains many rare artifacts from early cinema as well as one of the most extensive film archives in the world. This documentary will be most meaningful for those already familiar with Langlois' story. Through old film clips and interviews, Langlois is seen as an eccentric but charismatic young visionary obsessed with preserving and locating old films. Filmmaker Edgardo Cozarinsky uses scenes from Citizen Kane to compare the portly iconoclast to Charles Foster Kane, in that both Langlois and Welle's fictional newspaper magnate where avid collectors, and both were men of mystery.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":"/qYxepwFXPfSMBHYZqgIBu3kbHjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20116,"logo_path":"/qWEOTzHiZNWnyp1b3PYB1X63vfy.png","name":"La Cinémathèque Française","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Langlois","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Serge Lalou","original_name":"Serge Lalou","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/lJgdWev2t6vJL6I3984sFu92Nuk.jpg","credit_id":"554e34269251412253001437","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","original_name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ohvnmqBj5DyXvj4uD3veAqF0yDS.jpg","credit_id":"554e34099251416984001e5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","original_name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ohvnmqBj5DyXvj4uD3veAqF0yDS.jpg","credit_id":"554e3416c3a368187000200e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":978360,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martine Bouquin","original_name":"Martine Bouquin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554e34949251413e40002a26","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominique Païni","original_name":"Dominique Païni","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554e344c9251413fcf0047a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187095,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jacques Bouquin","original_name":"Jacques Bouquin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac648b00e0a26497a010b9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109438","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qYxepwFXPfSMBHYZqgIBu3kbHjt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
