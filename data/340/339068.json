An educational film preaching a fable-like message, it is however filled with humorous scenes that offset the film’s didacticism. Original director Yoshio Nishio fell ill and was replaced halfway through the shooting by the admired filmmaker Hiroshi Shimizu; though finished in May 1931, the film was shelved and never given a general release. Shot as a silent film, this version of the film features musical accompaniment, sound effects, and a spoken commentary track by a benshi narrator, thus bearing witness to the variety of forms taken by sound film during this transitional period.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/asF1D3AABf3nMXTI3j3uanIQq7w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1931-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shining Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shoichi Nodera","original_name":"野寺正一","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":"/oyTXi2OdkKrpGaQQbp62vQN3F0w.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"554a5952c3a36841b60025d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teruyo Hayami","original_name":"Teruyo Hayami","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/9h7zcBRltrBRpeYWpXSWdCGVd8n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"554a595cc3a3683c84001f57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shoichi Kofujita","original_name":"小藤田正一","popularity":0.2775,"profile_path":"/uAVVahgRjZsVXyK95rkSlfNew41.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"554a596cc3a3683c84001f5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin'ichirô Komura","original_name":"小村新一郎","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5eba0ec40cb3350020d38360","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsuko Fuji","original_name":"Tatsuko Fuji","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5eba0ed0c3514c001e5c913e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshio Nishio","original_name":"Yoshio Nishio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554a5984c3a36841af002849","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Shimizu","original_name":"清水宏","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":"/3L5WIwMHO7PyVkl3ObabOnGxzgA.jpg","credit_id":"554a597792514104ca002701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635086,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hiroomi Matsuzaki","original_name":"Hiroomi Matsuzaki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eba0ea0cc277c00206dde2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5131546","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/asF1D3AABf3nMXTI3j3uanIQq7w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
