Their only option is a desperate late night escape and evasion through a jungle filled with NVA soldiers.","popularity":0.2005,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":182534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storytellers International Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Bravery and Survival Against All Odds","title":"Escape from Firebase Kate","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.V.
