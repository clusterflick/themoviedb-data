It also presents a nice selection of script pages and memos as well. In the former category we find cast members 'Tippi' Hedren, Diane Baker, and Louise Latham, rejected screenwriters Joseph Stefano and Evan Hunter, final screenwriter Jay Presson Allen, daughter Pat Hitchcock O'Connell, production designer Robert Boyle, makeup artist Howard Smit, unit manager Hilton Green, Hitchcock historian Robin Wood, composer Bernard Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith, and Hitchcock fan/filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. An entertaining account of the film's production, the participants offer loads of valuable information and anecdotes. Highly enjoyable for Hitchcock fans and the film's growing number of admirers.","popularity":1.3436,"poster_path":"/eA2LGb5UyR7ZNdlMExZqHkf0uZs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trouble with 'Marnie'","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Immer Ã„rger mit Marnie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Stefano","original_name":"Joseph Stefano","popularity":0.3412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60ba6e53869e750029b2ef61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Hitchcock","original_name":"Patricia Hitchcock","popularity":0.2584,"profile_path":"/bgMYy4SJLFcFex91an1D593pBY9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (as Pat Hitchcock O'Connell)","credit_id":"5550772c92514171230002fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7394,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Evan Hunter","original_name":"Evan Hunter","popularity":0.3648,"profile_path":"/ljxSM4cA7d3eZ0jmfajqJgKz9gR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60ba6e67ab684900412adde9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6928,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Presson Allen","original_name":"Jay Presson Allen","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":"/eR72ktzUFXPU6pRjwq6qGd0zYtU.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60ba6e74176a94006f6bf60a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tippi Hedren","original_name":"Tippi Hedren","popularity":0.6526,"profile_path":"/7BrleQqFVU4d0sMDDHLbeJfyqBf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"555076ce9251416a930023e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hilton A.
