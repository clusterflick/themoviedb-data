Only Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik Party is resolute in calling for peace. In the front, the soldiers of one battalion elect three delegates to travel to St. Petersburg with donations the troops collected for the Pravda newspaper: Gudushauri, Panasiuk and Ershov. The three arrive in the capital and describe the horrendous conditions in which the soldiers live to Joseph Stalin, Lenin's trusted aid and colleague. They join the Bolsheviks and take part in the storming of the Winter Palace, led by Stalin and Lenin. Stalin announces that the great dawn of revolution has broken.","popularity":0.1502,"poster_path":"/dM0GKymFiQUtYKQIrySoUJiPDUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1938-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"Diadi gantiadi","type":"Alternative"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Великое зарево","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Myuffke","original_name":"Konstantin Myuffke","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"V.
