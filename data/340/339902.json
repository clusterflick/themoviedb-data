The son of the local pharmacist Gerald O'Connal, Brian is in many ways a typical boy, who dislikes school if only because of his run-ins with the nervous schoolteacher, Miss MacDonald, and who tries to catch gophers with his friends, Artie and Forbsie. His best friend and protector is slightly older Jonathan Ben, better known as The Young Ben (as his father is referred to as The Ben), who is highly regarded as a problem by those in town who see themselves as the moral authority if only because of The Young Ben's association to The Ben, the town still keeper and drunk. Brian's life takes a turn when his parents have to leave town temporarily, while Brian stays on his Uncle Sean's farm. That stint leads to a series of events which make Brian see life around him through slightly older and wiser eyes.","popularity":2.8499,"poster_path":"/zfXBoB1OSfVAJKULfCTgyTnNeng.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allan King Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1977-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Has Seen the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Painchaud","original_name":"Brian Painchaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oue8h0opWLXbFogoBRGQFwW9TNG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brian O'Connal","credit_id":"558b57a2c3a3687e5c001259","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Ferrer","original_name":"José Ferrer","popularity":0.6467,"profile_path":"/mMOxqZz7Te7SHTd7AGqpjyyykb7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Ben","credit_id":"558b5843c3a3687e590012cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Pinsent","original_name":"Gordon Pinsent","popularity":0.3389,"profile_path":"/rSIB6bLPrwDMaeJWoEbaoAcdGDT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gerald O'Connal","credit_id":"558b69fa92514141d5001b88","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Shaver","original_name":"Helen Shaver","popularity":1.0266,"profile_path":"/4RcaswFfLR8D3bQBHVlxyBR0R0H.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ruth Thompson","credit_id":"558b6a3d9251410cfd000058","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3966896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Junor","original_name":"Douglas Junor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"The Young Ben","credit_id":"6414c1c10d5d850083860339","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Hamilton","original_name":"Patricia Hamilton","popularity":0.2296,"profile_path":"/7XpPnfqrSFeQTj750wkpFvcG6g2.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Miss MacDonald","credit_id":"6414c1d16a2227010c4afe51","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chapelle Jaffe","original_name":"Chapelle Jaffe","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/zG5NSiL9l8BcuFrz7sCOF0FMDHx.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Maggie O'Connal","credit_id":"6414c1e15690b501016175b9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3966898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan Stewart","original_name":"Nan Stewart","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Mrs. MacMurray","credit_id":"6414c1f45690b5007a53c8f4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cedric Smith","original_name":"Cedric Smith","popularity":0.3587,"profile_path":"/wW6TtXWBChAD4ANSxVV8r6g8aw5.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Dr. Svarich","credit_id":"6414c2040d5d85007b6726ff","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":166127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Lawrence","original_name":"Linda Lawrence","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/2uNdz5FK7e2BxXIow0goaB6w86s.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Mariel","credit_id":"6414c2165690b500a216880c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Carlson","original_name":"Leslie Carlson","popularity":0.3884,"profile_path":"/9WEm25ndfB1pzJspHsigUn1y0iX.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Joe Pivott","credit_id":"6414c225310325007c092e8d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hauff","original_name":"Thomas Hauff","popularity":0.1538,"profile_path":"/niZqjCMr2ZNxp3IOEqGbQg2R0wm.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Principal Jim Digby","credit_id":"6414c232e74146008215b1e4","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan King","original_name":"Allan King","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/yaxrYor7cgzejBJmBsHxpXDoVoU.jpg","credit_id":"558b577cc3a3687e5f001292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2690204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.O.
