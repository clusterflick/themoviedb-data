N!ai tells her own story, and in so doing, the story of Ju/'hoan life over a thirty year period.  \"Before the white people came we did what we wanted,\" N!ai recalls, describing the life she remembers as a child: following her mother to pick berries, roots, and nuts as the season changed; the division of giraffe meat; the kinds of rain; her resistance to her marriage to /Gunda at the age of eight; and her changing feelings about her husband when he becomes a healer. As N!ai speaks, the film presents scenes from the 1950's that show her as a young girl and a young wife.  The uniqueness of N!ai may lie in its tight integration of ethnography and history. While it portrays the changes in Ju/'hoan society over thirty years, it never loses sight of the individual, N!ai.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":"/eSOHhlVL4OLiwIMWUyWyHxIv67E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N!ai, The Story of a !Kung Woman","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrienne Miesmer","original_name":"Adrienne Miesmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554c7c1fc3a3685e5b00408d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464925,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Ambrosino","original_name":"Michael Ambrosino","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554c7c47c3a368243100169a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Marshall","original_name":"John Marshall","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/aN1Rt8npcoqDNiQsnz8Iis0WYCN.jpg","credit_id":"57ae42729251412f4500009d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2903609,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Erder","original_name":"Mark Erder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe0e1888cfcc7003feaf6aa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Marshall","original_name":"John Marshall","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/aN1Rt8npcoqDNiQsnz8Iis0WYCN.jpg","credit_id":"5fe0e198f706de003d81b983","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross McElwee","original_name":"Ross McElwee","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/h0hGY95OYCC5g0JF0aLCyY6dish.jpg","credit_id":"5fe0e1b6e7c097004119715e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrienne Miesmer","original_name":"Adrienne Miesmer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe0e3225b370d004044f6e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Marshall","original_name":"John Marshall","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/aN1Rt8npcoqDNiQsnz8Iis0WYCN.jpg","credit_id":"5fe0e339d70594003e2c674a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212371","wikidata_id":"Q16211025","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eSOHhlVL4OLiwIMWUyWyHxIv67E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinémathèque Française","release_date":"1981-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Episode 2 of 'Odyssey' on PBS","release_date":"1980-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
