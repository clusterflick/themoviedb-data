The first person they meet in Jeju Island happens to be a tour guide who gives them some valuable advice: meet the people of Jeju Island, go see the small islands off Jeju-do and visit the shrinking 'gotjawal' rocky forests. This sets the tone for their journey as they set out from Jeju City to circumnavigate the entire island by bicycle with their 10-year-old son.","popularity":0.2862,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeju: A Bicycle Adventure in South Korea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3840612","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":267986,"name":"jeju island"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
