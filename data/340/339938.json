It is a journey through a time wich the world was made by war, that of wich we have so many times heard of and by wich we live constantly under menace. Emigration, war, freedom, childhood, the quest for something, a country -Mexico- kept in memories, are some of the subjects dealt within this film. Remembrance is the story of people who have traveled the world in search of a place where to belong, people whose lives were punctuated by ruptures.","popularity":0.1227,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14171,"logo_path":"/p9GWxbK3INIi1RJJBUzVNjmsEkC.png","name":"Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica (CCC)","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2003-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembrance","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Kerlow","original_name":"Max Kerlow","popularity":0.159,"profile_path":"/zJgH35JsHJUj6DxcDF8xDv7ekmq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55523bfec3a368436d003bd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Hacha","original_name":"Roberto Hacha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55523c09c3a3683fc8004d1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genova Arteaga","original_name":"Genova Arteaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55523c10c3a3683d3b0015f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Borrás","original_name":"José Borrás","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55523c24c3a3687f6300a0d2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1466384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcela Arteaga","original_name":"Marcela Arteaga","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55523bcb92514113f0001a03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1466384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcela Arteaga","original_name":"Marcela Arteaga","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55523bd5c3a36834e1005165","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1466384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marcela Arteaga","original_name":"Marcela Arteaga","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a0da379251412979000fde","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481911,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luciano Larobina","original_name":"Luciano Larobina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a0da4d925141296b000f00","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":961665,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roberto Bolado","original_name":"Roberto Bolado","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/hyXdbRHgczuHAUzxeaJNyryOHzi.jpg","credit_id":"55a0da289251412974000f87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044019,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigfrido Barjau","original_name":"Sigfrido Barjau","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a0da129251412977000f7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustavo Arteaga","original_name":"Gustavo Arteaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a0da70c3a3681cde000f28","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1857574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Santiago Núñez","original_name":"Santiago Núñez","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7a9c9f0e0a2611de11ec02","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":962983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Celiana Cárdenas","original_name":"Celiana Cárdenas","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/zizShiUxt4QamJUcxsY0eKrsGLb.jpg","credit_id":"5c9c3880c3a368182825f49a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0374162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
