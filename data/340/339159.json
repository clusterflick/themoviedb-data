It is held annually on the second weekend of every August, in Hildesheim, Germany at Flugplatz Hildesheim-Drispenstedt, a former British Army airbase.  The M'era Luna includes camping facilities and has two stages: a large rock festival style structure, erected for the show each year, and a former aircraft hangar.
