His back turned to the camera as he looks out over a nondescript housing development in Copenhagen, “The Shadow” describes how he fell victim to recruiters from the militant Somalian rebel group al-Shabaab. He outlines the conditions that make boys such as him susceptible to the lure of the “holy war,” explaining that, “Nothing in my life made any sense.” So eloquent is he in his account that one might think it was scripted, but what happened to him is as real as the scenes from a suicide attack by one of his former friends.","popularity":0.1049,"poster_path":"/9i1RX9RCTlOCRTCppVQIPkebOIV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16439,"logo_path":"/saXOIbS0x4LxBUHQZvuKuoV4tAk.png","name":"Made in Copenhagen","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SO","name":"Somalia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warriors from the North","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nasib Farah","original_name":"Nasib Farah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5601d72c92514122cd0002a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1089663,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Søren Steen Jespersen","original_name":"Søren Steen Jespersen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5601d73cc3a368552b0002a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4336190","wikidata_id":"Q20495933","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/9i1RX9RCTlOCRTCppVQIPkebOIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
