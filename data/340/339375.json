The original French title translates as \"Long Live the Bride...and the Liberation of Kurdistan.\" Cheto (Georges Corraface) seeks a wife via videotapes while still seeing his French girlfriend, immigration office worker Christine (Stephanie Lagarde). Cheto places an order for a beautiful girl, but he's disappointed when her sister, country girl Mina (Marina Kobakhidze), arrives at the airport as a substitute. Family pressure forces him to marry her. Unhappy with the way she's treated by Cheto, Mina acquires some progressive notions from Leila (Schahla Aalam) and other local feminists, leading to confrontations with Cheto.","popularity":0.3527,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":40669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du
