Without falling into cynicism, he skillfully laughs at our individual and collective failings, without forgetting to include himself in the process. Winner of three prestigious awards for emerging artists, he has won over an already loyal audience that has been eagerly awaiting this very first show. As he says himself, Cinglant is a show for everyone, but not for everyone.","popularity":0.1341,"poster_path":"/lWYhWOf6O9rKE8EX00BpB6GLVjc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39279,"logo_path":"/djEsVdwtMaiLnt3ci1vfNakkVdS.png","name":"Avanti Groupe","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guillaume Wagner - Cinglant","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1546343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Wagner","original_name":"Guillaume Wagner","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/qMhPAzx1ZJ3x0NRXMyZzsyV5Lqn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56856c0ac3a3683628003d8f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Laurin","original_name":"Daniel Laurin","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"555164bbc3a3687f63007db8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1661249,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luc Wiseman","original_name":"Luc Wiseman","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4762f000fb6b00140ad8db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Mercier","original_name":"Jean-François Mercier","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/sls4MSt9vO84N5L8cSCRXaQjiC1.jpg","credit_id":"5d4762cd00fb6b00130ae0b0","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1546343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Wagner","original_name":"Guillaume Wagner","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/qMhPAzx1ZJ3x0NRXMyZzsyV5Lqn.jpg","credit_id":"5d4762dfa0be280810a1dab1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Fortin","original_name":"Daniel Fortin","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4762b700fb6b00150ae761","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14179858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":893,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lWYhWOf6O9rKE8EX00BpB6GLVjc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":595}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3485,"name":"comedian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
