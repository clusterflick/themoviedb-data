They have little physical evidence - their main source, Frank Serpico, won't wear a wire. They finally strike gold when a corrupt cop named William Phillips agrees to become their undercover agent, in exchange for immunity from a bribery charge. The evidence he eventually collects leads directly to the indictment of thirty New York cops. But the tables quickly turn when Phillips himself is convicted of a double-homicide. Three decades later and still in prison Phillips claims he's the victim of a massive police conspiracy.","popularity":0.0688,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrolman P","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025144,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Forman","original_name":"Eric Forman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b40d21cba36f017b8d595d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ido Mizrahy","original_name":"Ido Mizrahy","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6404291de61e6d00963c17c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2766858","wikidata_id":"Q123597376","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
