The death of big Wolf 38, the original alpha male of the pack, is depicted with heart-breaking clarity. The loss of the alpha male is resolved when a Rose Creek male, Wolf 21, encounters the Druid pack in a never-before-filmed sequence of tenuous first-time introductions and eventual acceptance. Wolf 21 is the current alpha male of the pack to this day and his pack take-over stands out as one of the finest moments of wild wolf behaviour captured on film.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"National Geographic","title":"Return of the Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341257","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
