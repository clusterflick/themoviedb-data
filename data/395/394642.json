Even with local auto factories closing down and jobs being lost, the town's residents continue to flock to the local speedway every Friday night--and its drivers continue to pour their dwindling resources into their Thundercars. Emmy(R)-winning filmmaker Jon Alpert presents this look at this passion for racing in rust-belt America. Since the closing of a GM plant and the loss of 33,000 jobs, the once-thriving town of Anderson now stands witness to empty factories, shuttered stores and abandoned home--but also to packed houses at Anderson Speedway where people put their troubles on hold to watch the cacophony of screeching tires and crashing metal as drivers vie for Thundercar supremacy.","popularity":0.1943,"poster_path":"/92N5XETpauQJO5Pln2S26Nr5uRr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":59869,"logo_path":"/6ZiHprUC9pmyIvOn1E8EodbHGmq.png","name":"Downtown Community Television Center","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirty Driving: Thundercars Of Indiana","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Alpert","original_name":"Jon Alpert","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/gV6MbxjBthduIWjsJgTVxWsWfZl.jpg","credit_id":"5c9f37f4c3a368735581064e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Renaud","original_name":"Brent Renaud","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/gb1YJKvzEd51tna0P6aN7xmZR3t.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81f06680be8004015f032","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Alpert","original_name":"Jon Alpert","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/gV6MbxjBthduIWjsJgTVxWsWfZl.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81f1b0b5fd6003f689874","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabrielle Weiss","original_name":"Gabrielle Weiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81effdcf875003f3d7fc1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883459,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Meneses","original_name":"David Meneses","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81ef8681888003f1defae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":963501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew O'Neill","original_name":"Matthew O'Neill","popularity":0.1773,"profile_path":"/szXPiIKrxASlgwaazRN3NMRG9Br.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81f2cb0040a0042241ac6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Alpert","original_name":"Jon Alpert","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/gV6MbxjBthduIWjsJgTVxWsWfZl.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81f3b66a7c3004044645c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492576,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shannon Sonenstein","original_name":"Shannon Sonenstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc81f230b5fd6003f6898a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":963501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew O'Neill","original_name":"Matthew O'Neill","popularity":0.1773,"profile_path":"/szXPiIKrxASlgwaazRN3NMRG9Br.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81f0f43999b003e145019","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"5fc81f34dcf875003f3d8058","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1331305","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/92N5XETpauQJO5Pln2S26Nr5uRr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"18+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"HBO","release_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
