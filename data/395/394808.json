It flows north to the Mediterranean, crosses half a continent and over 7000 years of history. On its shores, civilizations have built marvels of architecture. Kingdoms rose and then fell, each person's destiny still intimately linked to that of the river... without anyone having mastered it. The Calypso team studies life around the Nile, which has remained almost unchanged since the time of the pharaohs.","popularity":0.2206,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35953,"logo_path":"/n4OA4cWRIjyGPVz6y7BXydyHSKU.png","name":"TF1
