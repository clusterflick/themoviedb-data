Employing many of the classic tropes of Mexican noir (blood-tainted money, hothouse betrayals, the entrapped yearnings of dark hearts), we follow the slow demise of a gang who hole up in an attic in the wake of a fatal robbery. Galindo liberally dashes in lashes of the smokiest amour mort, gradually whittling it down to an ill-fated if rapturous coupling of gangster’s moll and underling. Starring Leticia Palma and Víctor Parra.","popularity":0.5383,"poster_path":"/d5O037E3yyeYAvQ5y3pkKh0b8Gc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones
