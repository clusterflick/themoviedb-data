This film makes the connection between Aboriginals in chains in the 19th century and Aboriginal people in prisons today, so providing a deeper understanding of how the violence and denials of the past inform the present. It argues that the relentless removal of the Yindjibarndi/Ngarluma people into coastal ghettos has led to the community's current problems. Yet it never allows the viewer to forget the significance and influence of spiritual homelands, the bedrock upon which Yindjibarndi/Ngarluma tribal law is based. Above all, Exile and the Kingdom is a beautifully logical and persuasive argument for land rights.","popularity":0.2775,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1993-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exile And The Kingdom","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Innes","original_name":"Mick Innes","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/w7eaTMdoFPNbW4dVD67Zgn6Q9A7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6252d24efd63004a4bc2f089","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Rijavec","original_name":"Frank Rijavec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6252d2692f1be0522ae01c8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3500922,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noelene Harrison","original_name":"Noelene Harrison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6252d263b6c264250c87c3b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Rijavec","original_name":"Frank Rijavec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f146751a64e00366d83f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13234896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
