The citizens of a French village decide to celebrate their history by staging a play that will chronicle memorable events from the town's past. The play's author, Alexis, casts his wife Janine (Isabelle Candelier) in the leading female role despite her odd way of delivering dialogue. However, for the male lead, Alexis hires an arrogant professional actor from Paris, Jean-Pascal Faix. The village simpleton, Andre , has volunteered to serve as a stagehand and prompter. When Andre mistakenly leads Jean-Pascal into a trash dumpster that's soon dragged away, he's convinced (falsely) that he's killed the Parisian actor -- and is determined to take his place so that the show will go on.","popularity":0.2335,"poster_path":"/qCIGuix3ojsLTkkYuLFdJ9IjwHe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André le magnifique","video":false,"vote_average":1.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Vuillermoz","original_name":"Michel Vuillermoz","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/zYgJeIjNAJ4nieRI6ipmp9bwDEK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"André","credit_id":"571c77ce92514135ff003b33","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Candelier","original_name":"Isabelle Candelier","popularity":0.2238,"profile_path":"/sR3AtjW3DywjyOSlk09rwi1hTOU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Janine","credit_id":"571c77e09251415b0c0008fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Luc Porraz","original_name":"Jean-Luc Porraz","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/koeiD1vfoEGsBym4NQ05RqnUO1c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean-Pascal","credit_id":"571c77f4c3a36865240039cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Ligardes","original_name":"Patrick Ligardes","popularity":0.2112,"profile_path":"/eijIVv3DSQHK2YsaCByRWpLVpBS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alexis","credit_id":"571c78039251414a87000b29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loïc Houdré","original_name":"Loïc Houdré","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/3ZUAECMLd9aVK3BDKGehNS2fi5g.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Norbert","credit_id":"571c7816c3a36865240039d4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal Neuwirth","original_name":"Chantal Neuwirth","popularity":0.1787,"profile_path":"/77sFWks8GXwZGNq2l8T7wFnVfOp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Néné","credit_id":"571c782ac3a36865240039dd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Uchan","original_name":"Philippe Uchan","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/sBfrwOm7wgJgitDdhLX6zHPYKR1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Couderc","credit_id":"571c784192514135ff003b41","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Silvestre","original_name":"Emmanuel Silvestre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571c788c9251417d6f001794","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1468806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thibault Staib","original_name":"Thibault Staib","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571c78a9c3a368441e002619","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0238036","wikidata_id":"Q16303752","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qCIGuix3ojsLTkkYuLFdJ9IjwHe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
