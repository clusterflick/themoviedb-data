He's \"Romeo,\" still a lady's man, waiting to hear from a woman to whom he has proposed, threatening suicide if she says no. They gather at Isaac's grandson's, Ben, who lives with Peggy and their son Mathias who's 10. Joining them, from Israel, is Isaac's son Elie. Against a backdrop of Elie's attempts to call his ex-wife, Ben and Peggy's marital difficulties, Mathias's budding sexuality, everyone's love of chess and practical jokes, Ben's house (shifting dangerously on its foundation), and the twentieth-century struggles of the Jews, the film explores their relationships and Isaac's aging.","popularity":0.3388,"poster_path":"/nIXHh1ZPmNSS7qcHqAjp0NcS3UI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Tour","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":97291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Drouette","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Room for Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Lanoux","original_name":"Victor Lanoux","popularity":0.294,"profile_path":"/AuEzBr4wR5tZONg3t8z311AN5Wg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben Oppenheim","credit_id":"5720ecf092514142320008c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Birkin","original_name":"Jane Birkin","popularity":1.1324,"profile_path":"/wjYt9WdPVEm0BKF0sWi6RyZREOc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Peggy","credit_id":"5720ecfd9251414235000526","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Wilson","original_name":"Georges Wilson","popularity":0.3423,"profile_path":"/hifU1QhRKnX44VyrRBHmPldTsRy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eric Oppenheim","credit_id":"5720ed2092514144940004aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Crémieux","original_name":"Henri Crémieux","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/3rXhrBS967lMOJQHUqOIYa1P134.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Isaac 'Roméo' Oppenheim","credit_id":"5720ed2ec3a3681187000543","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Kassovitz","original_name":"Mathieu Kassovitz","popularity":1.0122,"profile_path":"/3FRBEdKKlxhvPWPt0jzgmSjeHwn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mathias Oppenheim","credit_id":"5a08efe8c3a368680a00a5cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Bertin","original_name":"Françoise Bertin","popularity":0.3252,"profile_path":"/46lh1xYytG8eHpcjzUyUE3EnWbM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"La voisine","credit_id":"6497ff506f43ec00e27dec19","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloé Caillat","original_name":"Chloé Caillat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Reinhold","credit_id":"6497ff5c6f43ec00e27dec21","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Chesnais","original_name":"Patrick Chesnais","popularity":0.27,"profile_path":"/g0eY9xGHUCIZBJj0QfxNnZQcH98.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"6497ff666f43ec00ac3b4c2a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Clech","original_name":"Yvonne Clech","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/26ukDqbtSK971vy0wR56GQdBkyf.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Irène Boyer","credit_id":"6497ff75b3440900ad52c583","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":282212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Coffe","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Coffe","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/rPxdOOd9fB4sBaxNJ2xwL0wHAdw.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Brigitte's Husband","credit_id":"6497ff866f43ec01399a53ea","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Giorgetti","original_name":"Florence Giorgetti","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":"/tthuECSivpw5C3E3zNrQ5Ekdi15.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Brigitte","credit_id":"6497ff8ebbd0b00144f3fc60","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odette Laure","original_name":"Odette Laure","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/1Jq4KxYEJRnqzczsL7z1SMN80gA.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"L'employée des Postes","credit_id":"6497ff97bbd0b000c8a332f9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Pasquali","original_name":"Fred Pasquali","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/zpYI1Yspq9c8Rj4ocANj70sgx1U.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"M.
