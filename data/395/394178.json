The film is the story of one woman's experience from childhood to the early years of adulthood, set against the tide of European history, which eventually carries her from her homeland to Australia. It weaves a poetic narrative from emotions, memories and inner imaginings and was developed from an original idea by producer, Julie Stone and director, Lynn-Maree Milburn. Director of photography, Andrew De Groot, assisted in all areas of post production.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/18tVAybtt6vaEYMg4Rns1B1XyMv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories And Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn-Maree Milburn","original_name":"Lynn-Maree Milburn","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571b7a52c3a3682434001393","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107550","wikidata_id":"Q33042079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1495,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/18tVAybtt6vaEYMg4Rns1B1XyMv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1050}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
