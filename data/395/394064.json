Who could have imagined the fate that awaited me: my birth under the Romanian dictatorship, the loss of my eyesight through an accident, my sudden escape from my homeland to seek a future that was a little too idyllic? One thing is certain: fate is like all the criminals that I listen to today for the Belgian federal police. With a little willpower, there is always a way to dodge its tricks. The person who taught me that is a close and loyal childhood friend. That friend is literature. Without her, I probably would not be what I am now, here, among you.","popularity":0.2909,"poster_path":"/mUL46OWA3dd17X3nbvSQRQymg91.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19840,"logo_path":"/wMwpc8pEyLec92n33kr4Px2378D.png","name":"Wallonie Image Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2013-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ion","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/n5BqsP6h3VtweQAFfQz2qtd5khq.jpg","credit_id":"625c2485df86a8005120ec51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Magis","original_name":"Olivier Magis","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c246ed266a20067b320f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Dardenne","original_name":"Luc Dardenne","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/hfnvLjmLKQyx1ftkuC6hhHwoTtM.jpg","credit_id":"625c248d13af5f1591fbad73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Magis","original_name":"Olivier Magis","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571a64dd92514169260000bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3408878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mUL46OWA3dd17X3nbvSQRQymg91.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6149,"name":"police"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":12660,"name":"blind"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
