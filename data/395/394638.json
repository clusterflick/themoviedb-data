Sitting Bull’s words, as portrayed by Adam Fortunate Eagle, dominate this story. Augmented by a narrator’s historical perspective, over six-hundred historical photographs and images, and a compelling original music score, the film brings to life the little-known human side of Sitting Bull as well as the story of a great man’s struggle to maintain his people’s way of life against an ever-expanding westward movement of white settlers. It is a powerful cinematic journey into the life and spirit of a legendary figure of whom people have often heard but don’t really know.","popularity":0.4766,"poster_path":"/tDHV4pxibhBSGgeGFSG5pERqGZX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76036,"logo_path":null,"name":"LilliMar Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The great American Indian Lakota Sioux Chief, spiritual leader and warrior as never before seen in a film.","title":"Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Fortunate Eagle","original_name":"Adam Fortunate Eagle","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Sitting Bull (voice)","credit_id":"571f8453c3a368339f003b20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Theobald","original_name":"William Theobald","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"571f85c6c3a368338c00392f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Ferry","original_name":"John Ferry","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571f861ec3a368338c003949","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Grace De Soto","original_name":"Grace De Soto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571f875592514142e2002e4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Ferry","original_name":"John Ferry","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cab95dc3a3687273002398","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611221,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Henry","original_name":"Steve Henry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57caba28c3a3686261002868","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611223,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernie Joseph Orosco","original_name":"Ernie Joseph Orosco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57caba1392514135140021c9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611222,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cory Orosco","original_name":"Cory Orosco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57caba039251411ac50029af","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611219,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Grace De Soto","original_name":"Grace De Soto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cab990c3a3685c250029a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611214,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Ferry","original_name":"John Ferry","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cab91b925141278a005216","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1493183","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tDHV4pxibhBSGgeGFSG5pERqGZX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":225068,"name":"lakota tribe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
