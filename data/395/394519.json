Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques Cousteau, takes us on a voyage to investigate first-hand the devastating impact of the U.S.'s largest oil spill. Amid the majestic mountains and ice floes of this serene setting, the leaking oil spreads like a virus staining and often killing everything it encounters. Harbor seals, sea otters, and bald eagles fall victim to the tragic accident.","popularity":0.8431,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76003,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Cousteau Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cousteau: Alaska: Outrage at Valdez","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Alaska: Outrage At Valdez","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Cousteau","original_name":"Jean-Michel Cousteau","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/uxuSBHi4LJ2rCIXOqoqU076YIIw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"571e87b49251416f28000aa8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Diperna","original_name":"Paula Diperna","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641e5c4fd6dbba011578552e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Cousteau","original_name":"Jean-Michel Cousteau","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/uxuSBHi4LJ2rCIXOqoqU076YIIw.jpg","credit_id":"641e5c0d54a8ac0096e09cf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Zappa","original_name":"Frank Zappa","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":"/dZiJTFW4cLaqxN7CFuA4NjSMFpi.jpg","credit_id":"641e5c57d6dbba007cd429bc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Mabilat","original_name":"Catherine Mabilat","popularity":0.0501,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641e5c411e9225007a52ca8d","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Diperna","original_name":"Paula Diperna","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641e5c28c613ce007cce341e","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0306683","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6305,"name":"pollution"},{"id":9880,"name":"alaska"},{"id":14649,"name":"oil spill"},{"id":163212,"name":"water pollution"},{"id":215299,"name":"environmental disaster"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
