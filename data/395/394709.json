Language preservation initiatives and mining opposition evoke emotional tones as the story swells with ravishing images of wilderness as a rough and untamed beauty. A thoughtful shift from Wild’s traditional narrative style of radical point of view documentary, \"KONELĪNE\" is a meditation on nature, culture, and economy as experienced by those who live and work on the land.","popularity":0.3357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KONELĪNE: our land beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"KONELINE: Our Land Beautiful","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Dennis","original_name":"Oscar Dennis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591aa99ac3a368426906c443","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Giguere","original_name":"Jake Giguere","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"591aa9bd92514156f5069805","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Gutfrucht","original_name":"Heidi Gutfrucht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"591aa9d492514159c10654fa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1484637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nettie Wild","original_name":"Nettie Wild","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571fe27392514110e6000083","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":195469,"name":"first nations"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Palm Springs International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - KONELĪNE: our land beautiful","key":"288611763","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-09-10T13:00:43.000Z","id":"5f4586a11d01910034dc0489"}]}}}
