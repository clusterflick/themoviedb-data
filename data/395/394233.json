In this French movie, Sonia Petrova plays a young ballerina pondering this question. Her teacher is incredibly strict and stern, and the regimen she requires is all-encompassing. She explores the alternatives through the help of a hip young male student of modern dance, with whom she has a brief affair, but decides to continue with her classical training.","popularity":0.1855,"poster_path":"/wm6kTNF4fRwk85pX86FYGka6cAp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":204762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artémis
