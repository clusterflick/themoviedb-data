Ever since the Navy occupied the island, the inhabitants opposed their presence. Finally, after decades of resistance and struggle, the United States Armed Forces were forced to leave the island and cease all military practices on its surroundings. Now, more than a decade after the Navy’s questionable departure, the islanders are demanding the US Government to fully decontaminate and give back the terrains exploited. Unsatisfied with the little commitment from Federal Agencies to assume responsibilities, the Viequenses face a new struggle to demand justice within their lands.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/r1JdVwonQWYSOTBcbqKnS8YA4LK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frutos Fílmicos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2015-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vieques: una batalla inconclusa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","title":"Vieques: An Endless Battle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1606432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Auger","original_name":"Tito Auger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"571c5b6c92514121a00056a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1609981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Massol","original_name":"Arturo Massol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"571c5b9bc3a3684e620004de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Kayak","original_name":"Tito Kayak","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57527667c3a36852010019f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María de Lourdes Santiago","original_name":"María de Lourdes Santiago","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"57fb2ba4c3a3683b0a004dd4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan C.
