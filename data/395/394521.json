In all Doubt on Loan focuses on the dysfunctional librarians of Shawcross Library and Interactive centre, as they navigate their way through running a failing library in our increasingly hyper-modern technology based world, relationships and their pasts. Making matters worse their warped views, and precarious judgments often lead them to trouble, creating a myriad of uncomfortable situations that usually only get worse before they get better (which doesn't often happen).","popularity":0.7211,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doubt on Loan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1562390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Ford","original_name":"Louise Ford","popularity":0.2254,"profile_path":"/qJWjiV3DqWOco3yf0MhJUDG4vcW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mia","credit_id":"571e8d85c3a368339f000b3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Brassington","original_name":"Christian Brassington","popularity":0.1499,"profile_path":"/9uRJx2oYlCKuPrbqc9htOPZRqzu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nic","credit_id":"571e8d859251416f25000b21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Fynn","original_name":"David Fynn","popularity":0.5338,"profile_path":"/6knJVGZnTMM11fVQFKjWdel9xhG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eddie","credit_id":"571e8d869251414df4000185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1510694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Colquhoun","original_name":"Sophie Colquhoun","popularity":0.3324,"profile_path":"/qsoDusU6qmieTGxXIrHxMgZtmBx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"571e8d86c3a368339a000b59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bentley Kalu","original_name":"Bentley Kalu","popularity":0.4676,"profile_path":"/nTl6fkv3qxcBecGshPbDx6KP4gy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Philip Dunleavy","credit_id":"571e8d86c3a3683393000c9d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449853,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike O'Leary","original_name":"Mike O'Leary","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571e8b879251416f2f000b82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1389328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Aryeh","original_name":"Ian Aryeh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571e8b929251416f20000b1e","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1389328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Aryeh","original_name":"Ian Aryeh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571e8b7692514142e20002bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1519841,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robbie Morrison","original_name":"Robbie Morrison","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6777be16c11ee61dd8749a9e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2244819","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207447,"name":"librarian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London","release_date":"2012-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
