Following two wildly different reconstruction attempts in 1939 (Marie Seton's 'Time in the Sun') and 1979 (Grigori Alexandrov's '¡Que viva México!') Kovalov has here compiled another hypothetical version of what Eisenstein's film might have been.","popularity":0.3313,"poster_path":"/tkqMZR6wSJHNq4ewpNUZOFwuWqp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25606,"logo_path":"/eSlqpXsyQW7u059lOnSsXtUakLl.png","name":"Gosfilmfond
