The legal fiction that Australia was empty when first occupied by white people had been laid to rest. Mabo-Life of an Island Man tells the private and public stories of a man so passionate about family and home that he fought an entire nation and its legal system. Though his greatest victory was won only after his death, it has forever ensured his place - on Murray Island and in Australian history.","popularity":0.0947,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1997-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mabo: Life of an Island Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Graham","original_name":"Trevor Graham","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce3d763d93700613bba3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Graham","original_name":"Trevor Graham","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce3e37ef3812768ed44ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596906,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bronwyn Murphy","original_name":"Bronwyn Murphy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce45f1b722c00619b6492","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469251,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denise Haslem","original_name":"Denise Haslem","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce3ee84f2491738372df6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469251,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denise Haslem","original_name":"Denise Haslem","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce477356a71147d6e0c39","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401737,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Whitteron","original_name":"John Whitteron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bce44b17792c0094036ae3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trevor Graham","original_name":"Trevor Graham","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571c3dcf9251414e97006ab4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133077","wikidata_id":"Q27590416","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
