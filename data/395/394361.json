Named after a 19th-century Native leader, the centre offers a space where Natives can come together for mutual support, partake in healing rituals like the sweat lodge, and rediscover their traditions. The film shows the despair of a people dispossessed of land, culture, language and dignity, and their strength and courage in overcoming substance abuse.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poundmaker's Lodge: A Healing Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"571d0bc0c3a3686524005075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"571d0be4c3a3685d260005f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dario Domingues","original_name":"Dario Domingues","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571d0c2292514121a0006e9d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marrin Canell","original_name":"Marrin Canell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571d0bf6c3a3685e1600060b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610358,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shannon Two Feathers","original_name":"Shannon Two Feathers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571d0c19c3a3685d06000722","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"571d0bedc3a36842aa0015ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Verrall","original_name":"Robert Verrall","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571d0c009251414a8700209f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610357,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rita Roy","original_name":"Rita Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571d0c0fc3a3686524005080","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0143811","wikidata_id":"Q59617166","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
