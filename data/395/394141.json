Michel Fano, who took his composition class at the Paris Conservatory, films some of the privileged moments of his teaching. This film, co-directed with Denise Tual, also shows Messiaen as a devotee, an ornithologist, and a synaesthete, evoking the fundamental concepts of his inspiration with an often sparkling ease (the musician imitating certain bird songs in a manner reminiscent of Rouch recreating the cries of wizards for certain films). In this way, the film boldly collides sequences with visual or sound correspondences, the directors succeeding in dragging us into the world of mystery and dreams dear to the musician.\" (François Waledisch)","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/e1U9jIwxLQIEOI9hWqAMXCopqAR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofracima","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1973-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olivier Messiaen and the Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3609408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvio Gualda","original_name":"Sylvio Gualda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c0b296e16e5a005bccb034","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2792939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Béroff","original_name":"Michel Béroff","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/96iAbvpF9LWOMDhGFzRBvD2Yb3a.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c0b2a51056110ecf3121ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315573,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Iannis Xenakis","original_name":"Iannis Xenakis","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/75jGfZS2mJS0gG1lLvUYt9esqfi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c0b2b4af6e94125decf489","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3609409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Louvier","original_name":"Alain Louvier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c0b2c5e16e5a004e8fd6f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2783900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Loriod","original_name":"Yvonne Loriod","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/s1sQZVTaEtf8GWmIRjKD70sLLsJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c0b2d563d713026bc6eee6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2012258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Messiaen","original_name":"Olivier Messiaen","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/5EJCmxl7zcYNHTYvTBCdZKRcauc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c0b345924ce6004cb25051","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lapoujade","original_name":"Robert Lapoujade","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c0b321aaf897004c68d4c0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1473035,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philippe Théaudière","original_name":"Philippe Théaudière","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f943ebe267de007eb869fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel Fano","original_name":"Michel Fano","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":"/tXtNhEVoJRO2mHYZIA6eHC3EOjO.jpg","credit_id":"571b27aac3a368195b0021a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denise Tual","original_name":"Denise Tual","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571b27bc925141115f004769","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3539152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e1U9jIwxLQIEOI9hWqAMXCopqAR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
