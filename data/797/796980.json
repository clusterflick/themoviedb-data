Designed for dialogue, the film works to disentangle internal beliefs, attitudes and pre-judgments within, and it builds skills to address the structural drivers of social and economic inequities.  Cracking the Codes supports institutions and communities to deepen and shift the framing of racial disparities. The current conversation is not only shallow, but actually harmful. We continue to primarily focus on individuals, when institutional and structural inequities are the bigger problem.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/235KfN2B2IP9cxO8pjfDQqdEjAL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cracking the Codes: The System of Racial Inequity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shakti Butler","original_name":"Shakti Butler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60294df228723c0040d24252","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1015,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/235KfN2B2IP9cxO8pjfDQqdEjAL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":676}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
