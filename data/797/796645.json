It's a deeply sad story of loss and denial, but at its conclusion the clouds lift and there is acceptance at least. Having worked with her on 3 previous videos, I knew as soon as I wrote it that it was perfect for Jess to do something amazing with. Even then nothing prepared me for the organic beauty and power of the film she made, a painstaking labour of love that took her months to produce. When we play the song live I look out into the audience and see people swept away with emotion at the combination of music and animation. To find poetry and beauty in sadness is a wonderful thing I think\" - Steven Wilson","popularity":0.2292,"poster_path":"/8iz7xfivqV7aWpvw5gfZF0FAprs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Owl House Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steven Wilson: Routine","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Wilson","original_name":"Steven Wilson","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/gZ01q1CNcQIMKLbkzEDvwxjj22r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"vocals","credit_id":"6687d8c2dbf866c30d081351","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3144557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jess Cope","original_name":"Jess Cope","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9c50f432c50cbe05d3a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8338142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3BMzULCjb3cnMUweYWQQuiaQgR0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iz7xfivqV7aWpvw5gfZF0FAprs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5699,"name":"music video"},{"id":157954,"name":"progressive rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
