Using cutting-edge research, a dedicated team of archaeologists led by Professor Mike Parker Pearson have painstakingly compiled evidence to fill in a 400-year gap in our knowledge of the bluestones, and to show that the original stones of Britainâ€™s most iconic monument had a previous life.  Alice joins Mike as they put together the final pieces of the puzzle, not just revealing where the stones came from, how they were moved from Wales to England or even who dragged them all the way, but also solving one of the toughest challenges that archaeologists face.","popularity":0.9539,"poster_path":"/uimzVgPeM1NgEShatFUaAc5RruK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tomos TV","origin_country":""},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stonehenge: The Lost Circle Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Roberts","original_name":"Alice Roberts","popularity":0.2803,"profile_path":"/4ZRhDueGV0DcWNoKAipg1AAnGPG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"6027f93cebb99d004008b91f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2621050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Parker Pearson","original_name":"Mike Parker Pearson","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/aXjVTJ4wO7WN2dg7jbu0SpjGEFw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6054e017c433ea44fb8b21f2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Chinn","original_name":"Peter Chinn","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60acce3690ea4b0057471218","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Chinn","original_name":"Peter Chinn","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c94600b0422800902ae18e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Chinn","original_name":"Peter Chinn","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649daa62c072a200ece449fa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1855047,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Acum","original_name":"Patrick Acum","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649daa8fc072a200cbcf8c7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarjit Bains","original_name":"Sarjit Bains","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649daaa03e6f2b00ad17649f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2976409,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Warr","original_name":"Steve Warr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6027f992149565003d0a2fff","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14063674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xt0hTIpEWReNckU87k64fqqw0gx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lbsjHjucGrEecBX97a0oPqmBsyP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1132},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uimzVgPeM1NgEShatFUaAc5RruK.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":834},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3O5K6AlZi41Cd7aV3M3XJiFdMeu.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/Gl8L2DwtkPczdUnsVNZuGwTHrA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1894,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9y6SYhIbWpPdLyzrdrX8ljt17rj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1263}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184134,"name":"archeology"},{"id":207031,"name":"stonehenge"},{"id":231288,"name":"historic site"},{"id":239820,"name":"paternity mystery"},{"id":242164,"name":"scientific research"},{"id":258029,"name":"mythical artifact"},{"id":330079,"name":"neolithic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
