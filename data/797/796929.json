Early in the morning, the trucks returned to Rabin Square and prepared a white, frosty surprise for the residents. In front of the square, now covered with snow, lives the Dahan family, which is facing eviction on that very same day. The film follows the four truck drivers making their journey from the north, and Hanna, the mother of the family, as she sees her life melting down before her.","popularity":0.1779,"poster_path":"/nIuMQGE81dvqc3CLsgqXP1A6Lpu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gesher Multicultural Film
