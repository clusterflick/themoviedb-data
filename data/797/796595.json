The mystery around Sam's presence in town unravels when it's discovered that his estranged daughter Audrey lives there - the daughter he hasn't seen her in 25 years. As he tries to bridge the gap between the little girl he left long ago and the woman who grew up without her father, Sam learns he was never cut-out to be emotionally connected to anyone - unless he falls in love with another soul just as lonesome.","popularity":1.798,"poster_path":"/992dYc9ols9g7SA83dl8tlLhHei.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"There's never a wrong time for the right move","title":"Sometime Other than Now","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donal Logue","original_name":"Donal Logue","popularity":1.2878,"profile_path":"/5Rj850yVkIqsgCihtZLbkNSHbFb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"6043dcbd1a934f006ef9c78c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":61114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Walsh","original_name":"Kate Walsh","popularity":1.7394,"profile_path":"/xKy0PNB5xLSwm6yyL3zZ5zUNvQZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"6043a6c16cf3d50046144f5b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Hargreaves","original_name":"Amy Hargreaves","popularity":0.5199,"profile_path":"/jwE1G6jVtBi20ZGjC8U4GOWSIxw.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Maureen","credit_id":"6043abfcdb8a0000466e836d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trieste Kelly Dunn","original_name":"Trieste Kelly Dunn","popularity":1.0585,"profile_path":"/5p2WYHJWBlaqlNMaUpeAewM2FSg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Audrey","credit_id":"6043a85ea410c800455adf32","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2380384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexa Swinton","original_name":"Alexa Swinton","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/xD3maXuzCeLPgBipvNV9NfjQyzW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"6043a9c96cf3d500705acaaa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Aguirre","original_name":"Diego Aguirre","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sergio","credit_id":"6043a5c1f12cf4002a8189cc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2603444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Jes Austell","original_name":"Sarah Jes Austell","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Amber","credit_id":"6043a60bf12cf40045e72512","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Aaron Baker","original_name":"David Aaron Baker","popularity":0.4092,"profile_path":"/8wAIPBB1F0u04PmYLZVd2t8r9bf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"6043a74e84f249005a52f910","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1805299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debra Lord Cooke","original_name":"Debra Lord Cooke","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bookstore Owner","credit_id":"6043a7eadb8a0000466e7dc7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3000740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerry Ferretti","original_name":"Gerry Ferretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tourist","credit_id":"6043a908d18572004331dbcc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.J.
