Qais becomes obsessed with her, and his tribe Banu 'Amir and the community gives him the epithet of “Majnun” (\"crazy\", literally \"possessed by jinn\"). When Qais asked for Laila’s hand in marriage, her father refused because it would be a scandal for her to marry someone considered mentally unbalanced. Soon after, Laila was married to another noble and rich merchant. When Qais heard of her marriage, he fled the tribal camp and began wandering the surrounding desert.","popularity":0.0837,"poster_path":"/lOpfRs1VjRFYcFsPEAqB3eJjPgr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay-Keris Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laila Majnun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nordin Ahmad","original_name":"Nordin Ahmad","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":"/5e0ctiamhQvPSYpSDLOGkgfmjVq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6027720626dac1003eab4387","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1048384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latifah Omar","original_name":"Latifah Omar","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/k7xIeREOi72zep8IbX4zAUqFKak.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60277217ea84c7003f614298","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"B.
