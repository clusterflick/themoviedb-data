Four names for just one woman: fascinating, moody and very creative. Singer, songwriter, actress, ballet, folk, burlesque and exotic dancer, snake charmer and fakir were only some of the artistic endeavors she tackled during her life. Found dead on the trailer where she lived in August of 1985, in California, she left behind stories without conclusion, lost remainings of her troubled trajectory and a trail of mystery. Three decades later, two historians gather fragments of her tale with the goal of piecing together the complex puzzle that was her life. Actresses, singers, musicians and performers join them to rescue the poetic aspects of her unique personality. A question resounds throughout the entire movie: Suzy King, who are you?","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/xmLgo06w3geHPARJ6GqPyO91Tdc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122465,"logo_path":null,"name":"DGT
