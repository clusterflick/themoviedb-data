And it will still be there after our death. Not that the landscape always remains the same: every generation wipes out the traces of previous generations, and itself leaves new traces behind. This process has been followed for seven years with great detail, craftsmanship and without misplaced nostalgia on Super16 by Eugenie Jansen and Albert Elings. On the banks of the Netherrhine River, between the dike and the river itself, is a stretch of water meadow, Loowaard. In the derelict farmstead lives the last farmer who had cows here, there are remains of a brick factory that no longer has a function, and in the ground, remains have been found of an old Roman encampment. Until recently, the march of progress apparently had left this piece of land untouched. But now the meadows have to make way for the development of new nature.","popularity":0.0922,"poster_path":"/ncwIS75mcisjT6dSkOnpoVjIgV2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruim Kader Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foreland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2436585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Elings","original_name":"Albert Elings","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6026a8d0d05a03003db6a7f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugenie Jansen","original_name":"Eugenie Jansen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iZgI0eF6VmM99EpDrLz9d1eY3gA.jpg","credit_id":"6026a8dc8b959e7de61fa8d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaap van Hoewijk","original_name":"Jaap van Hoewijk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zvlJevqZKtp9p26eSEXU0gDz6fY.jpg","credit_id":"6026a8ee9d2b63004069d09e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Smits","original_name":"Rob Smits","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6026a90bd6c30000406e230e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugenie Jansen","original_name":"Eugenie Jansen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iZgI0eF6VmM99EpDrLz9d1eY3gA.jpg","credit_id":"6026a8fb8b959e7de61fa91b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2518484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":781,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncwIS75mcisjT6dSkOnpoVjIgV2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
