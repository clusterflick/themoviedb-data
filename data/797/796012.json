All the while, the bodies of teenage and college-age girls pile up around the tri-state in a pattern the police haven't quite figured out yet involves the band's lead singer, who doubles as a serial killer, his tour dates are his hunting ground, with new groupies dying every show. A cat-and-mouse slasher/thriller will keep the audience at the edge of their seats as the cops chase the bodies and try to catch up with a savage murderer addicted to the thrill and getting worse with each new kill!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ohio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2974034,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jake Brown","original_name":"Jake Brown","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602593f4498ef9003df7b4bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11384184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
