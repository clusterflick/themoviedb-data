It is a deeply personal story, taking us on a journey from war-torn Poland and Ukraine to the Highlands of Scotland and then back again. Blending documentary, theatre and poetic drama-reconstruction, Circling a Fox tells the story of Matthew's quest to seek the truth about his father’s past and his efforts to use theatre to reach out to a family he never knew he had.","popularity":0.1059,"poster_path":"/2GT4SHaZH0wUFMzwbWKZsg5VAKR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13788,"logo_path":"/dNLCLFvMac9l8xIBhKOyJKfef7u.png","name":"Hopscotch Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circling a Fox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathew Zajac","original_name":"Mathew Zajac","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/eimpFgoPxaoUUqU87JmvwxlBY2T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"602839f1dfe31d003d487f46","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathew Zajac","original_name":"Mathew Zajac","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/eimpFgoPxaoUUqU87JmvwxlBY2T.jpg","credit_id":"602839dd9a358d0040fcf823","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1860046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Archer","original_name":"John Archer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602839ac3a48c500410c2859","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5254840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Ross","original_name":"Brian Ross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b4b53520b8dc549ae0c4e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2GT4SHaZH0wUFMzwbWKZsg5VAKR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Scotland","release_date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
