They are soon apprehended and sent to prison for ten years but the money is not recovered. Flash forward to 1936 when all three men have been released from prison and are about to be deported back to where they came from via the Deportation department at Ellis Island. They arrive by the ferry boat and already on hand to bid them adieu, and possibly learn where they stashed the missing money, is gang leader Dude and his three henchmen, Nails, Moxie and Bugs, and also Kendrich's niece Betty Parker there to bid old Uncle Ted a fond goodbye. Also on Ellis Island is a crook called Solo, who has an upper hand as he has stolen the credentials of a Treasury Agent named Peter James and has access to the prisoners, and has cut a deal with Kendrichs to get him off of Ellis Island.","popularity":0.6703,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invincible Pictures Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ellis Island","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Cook","original_name":"Donald Cook","popularity":0.1737,"profile_path":"/i0AgYtBb3jyorw1YU3odb4P726d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gary Curtis","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e20598d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Shannon","original_name":"Peggy Shannon","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/zBZnCypoaIJ6c85b4v4uZQPdl1w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Betty Parker","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e205991","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack La Rue","original_name":"Jack La Rue","popularity":0.3044,"profile_path":"/wskA4CUxsCtRHiEI63FTAkkDXAL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dude","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e205995","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Compton","original_name":"Joyce Compton","popularity":0.4196,"profile_path":"/z5rRRN40OSWX1G5i5edvfqe56wv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Adele","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e205999","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Page","original_name":"Bradley Page","popularity":0.2699,"profile_path":"/2V94P0WINKifnZQ0AydJqi5efCL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Solo","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e20599d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Arthur","original_name":"Johnny Arthur","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/f8mltNpEviyIDYnKFBbwRtFAm7o.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kip Andrews","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059a1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Black","original_name":"Maurice Black","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/1HQfoFmDIXwxE1e3sugCjJnTQQh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nails","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059a9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matty Fain","original_name":"Matty Fain","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/fxeyEXpCMt53DYyNqBOmhO4by0f.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Turk","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059ad","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryant Washburn","original_name":"Bryant Washburn","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":"/5UlSMWoAnoXIoa5cTv7yf1yECRn.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Peter James","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059b1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Kelly","original_name":"Lew Kelly","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/d3Euk0SE0EJE5K5TKhantKL5kg8.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Farmer","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059b9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Rosener","original_name":"George Rosener","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Uncle Ted Kedrich","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059a5","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Vandergrift","original_name":"Monte Vandergrift","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Moxey","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e2059b5","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Rosen","original_name":"Phil Rosen","popularity":0.4767,"profile_path":"/oA7r2vrVNAg27bTIJSVEItZA33w.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df0c3a368484e205989","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2292217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert S.
