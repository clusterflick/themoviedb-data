The film is visual dynamite: Upside-down and reversed footage, play with shadows and light, billiards and dice and balloons-- suggestive and surreal images. Tenets of Dada writing, such as games of chance, punnery, wordplay and loud nonsense noise are foist upon the viewer as Dada poems are read / performed by their orignal authors.","popularity":0.1481,"poster_path":"/mHlx2aRupB8ECi6oKCXjAYrJAMT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
