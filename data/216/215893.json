Recycling elements of surrealism and cubism, this animated short by Theodore Ushev focuses on the relationship between art and war. Propelled by the exalting “invasion” theme from Shostakovich’s Leningrad Symphony (No. 7), the film presents imagery of combat fronts and massacres, leading us from Dresden to Guernica, from the Spanish Civil War to Star Wars. It is at once a symphony that serves the war machine, that stirs the masses, and art that mourns the dead, voices its outrage and calls for peace.","popularity":0.1468,"poster_path":"/9mHOoaM9CORDf7uLLKS5UZlbTxM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gloria Victoria","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theodore Ushev","original_name":"Theodore Ushev","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/7yqGVWTwp1rpXF74MWliwXgVlSf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e0cc3a368484e20b6eb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theodore Ushev","original_name":"Theodore Ushev","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/7yqGVWTwp1rpXF74MWliwXgVlSf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e0cc3a368484e20b6e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114358,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Calvert","original_name":"Olivier Calvert","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":"/e3iZCsoamtUcVDmN1rwsxAJVFgr.jpg","credit_id":"614a3a009a9f9a004311d5c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Bertrand","original_name":"Marc Bertrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614a3a5c9a9e20006319dcab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3085067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diane Régimbald","original_name":"Diane Régimbald","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614a3a2622df2e0065712b4d","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2608802,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denis Gathelier","original_name":"Denis Gathelier","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614a3a0ba6ddcb002c0b3d22","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francine Langdeau","original_name":"Francine Langdeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614a3a3ad2c0c1006680a67e","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jocelyne Perrier","original_name":"Jocelyne Perrier","popularity":0.0854,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614a3a4422df2e0065712beb","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Chénier","original_name":"René Chénier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614a3a52b04228004380b1f7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3010302","wikidata_id":"Q15312783","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cr7cYl8pfvIHflP9qP7RkU46hvb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9mHOoaM9CORDf7uLLKS5UZlbTxM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6057,"name":"peace"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
