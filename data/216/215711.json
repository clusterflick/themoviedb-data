The film goes in-depth to portray the experiences and insights of both teachers and practitioners in the US and around the world. Along the way, it illuminates the wide ranging dialogs taking place between Buddhist teachings and science, psychology, gender theory and the arts. The film creates a vivid and entertaining portrait of the world of Tibetan Buddhism, as it is manifesting in the West and asks the vital question - 'In these increasingly chaotic modern times, can these age old teachings help us to find genuine happiness and create a saner, more compassionate 21st century world?'","popularity":0.1074,"poster_path":"/fKQWDTOIE87SwYr1E1kmSxvyXt1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beyond Words Publishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-20","revenue":13598,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Iron Bird Flies","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4540466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victress Hitchcock","original_name":"Victress Hitchcock","popularity":0.232,"profile_path":"/gyidZ13IU02joL2HpnddERH0wI6.jpg","credit_id":"661f0371ecaef5017cf9ab8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amber Bemak","original_name":"Amber Bemak","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f9e16b84cdd016464674a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2445488","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fKQWDTOIE87SwYr1E1kmSxvyXt1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
