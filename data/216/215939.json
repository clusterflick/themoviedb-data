Told from the first person unscripted perspective of the school teacher and DJ who were there that night, The Chaperone recreates the whole scene using hand drawn animation, miniature sets, puppets, live action Kung Fu and explosions all done in stereoscopic 3D. With over 10,000 hand drawings (many of which were colored in crayon by hand), an original blaxploitation score and featuring a cast of over 200 people, The Chaperone is an unconventional approach to documentary shorts.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/bzyJlETGgSkDiquRQ2GKCdZqIz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thoroughbread Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chaperone","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3837324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Whims","original_name":"Ralph Whims","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"63a07b67da10f01c6beaaeaf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3837325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Czernatowicz","original_name":"Stefan Czernatowicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"63a07b792f3b1700e6da34f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fraser Munden","original_name":"Fraser Munden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Young Stefan","credit_id":"63a07b8f2f3b1700e6da3501","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3837328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris McMahon","original_name":"Chris McMahon","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Young Ralph","credit_id":"63a07bbbda10f01c5158966d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1883408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Nguyen Khan","original_name":"Fred Nguyen Khan","popularity":0.7815,"profile_path":"/z4XxWOlKyrTIEugsmtpzKnueq4q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Kneebreaker (Blue)","credit_id":"63a07bd28ddc3414969c51df","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fraser Munden","original_name":"Fraser Munden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e0ec3a368484e20bc7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fraser Munden","original_name":"Fraser Munden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a07b42c8f3c400c070da6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3811157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Rathbone","original_name":"Neil Rathbone","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a07b542f3b1700e6da34da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3069670","wikidata_id":"Q61968375","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bzyJlETGgSkDiquRQ2GKCdZqIz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
