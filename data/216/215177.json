But behind this dazzling facade lies a disturbing story of history’s largest-ever slave population. Astonishingly Brazil, a Portuguese colony, received ten-times more African slaves than the numbers transported to North America. This programme looks at those estimated 4 million people with whose blood, sweat and tears Brazil was built. Without them none of Brazil’s present-day success and appeal would exist. Using contemporary testimonies, this film takes a hard look at Brazil s dark history through the eyes of those slaves. They lived in squalid conditions on remote plantations or in teeming cities harboring fatal diseases. Most Africans survived only seven years in this ‘New World’.","popularity":0.2808,"poster_path":"/AjMiUT6IsvHqxFd8xzYS8twtrcq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brazil: An Inconvenient History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Barrett","original_name":"Sean Barrett","popularity":0.1595,"profile_path":"/i2SvDD2QMYwadsZbpL1RJA34i10.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4df6c3a368484e206c03","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8BEReISVL3WgLr42ZE68m6213OI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AjMiUT6IsvHqxFd8xzYS8twtrcq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/22583a9bfc90457e9bc333e8d8f5c963","release_date":"2000-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
