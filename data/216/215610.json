Martin is the youngest son of the widowed head forester Thomas Rufmann. Martin's older brother Friedolin has inherited his father's love of hunting and is one of the best hunters in the area. He is also engaged to the pretty innkeeper's daughter Helene Schwarzaug. At the feast, Friedolin and his cronies drink heavily to the black liquor of the charcoal burner Krauthaas. Friedolin and the townspeople Günther have a loud argument in front of everyone. When Günther is found murdered a short time later, suspicion immediately falls on Friedolin. To save his brother, Martin accuses himself of the crime. The two brothers are arrested. The real culprit soon turns himself in, but in the meantime Thomas Rufmann has disappeared without a trace.","popularity":0.3519,"poster_path":"/wPsOARvCrmJ3XcvZcUsTm0GQM7Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maxim-Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1955-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Försterbuben","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Auer","original_name":"Erich Auer","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/iOqm98eWheUo0TVXPAYZAg4v8FJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Martin, zweiter Sohn","credit_id":"52fe4e03c3a368484e20992f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Rosar","original_name":"Annie Rosar","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/wDCJT9HbTrxXOFcHNBYCvmj3X9J.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Die alte Sali","credit_id":"52fe4e03c3a368484e209933","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Gretler","original_name":"Heinrich Gretler","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/w4kI5xWkrVjbea3sHKvzxlQWFSe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Köhler","credit_id":"54a3ed07c3a3680b2700f9d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bürgermeister Gerald","credit_id":"54a3ed16925141212700881e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hörbiger","original_name":"Paul Hörbiger","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/jrTXAidwAiHz5xW5M96uzvkTcDN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Michel Schwarzaug","credit_id":"54a3eda8925141198b0065b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Erhardt","original_name":"Hermann Erhardt","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Thomas Rufmann, Förster","credit_id":"52fe4e03c3a368484e209927","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herta Staal","original_name":"Herta Staal","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bianca","credit_id":"54a3edb5c3a3684d8f004946","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Heintel","original_name":"Kurt Heintel","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Friedolin, ältester Sohn","credit_id":"52fe4e03c3a368484e20992b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Probst","original_name":"Eva Probst","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":"/cc0lYf7Cuf6uNmT0WVXGPcza8o3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helene","credit_id":"54a3ed97c3a368764f00e7dd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franziska Kinz","original_name":"Franziska Kinz","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/3LMksPNG0oXxENLf7vVZ8lPJwK9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mutter von Helene","credit_id":"54a3edd2925141236b008e64","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
