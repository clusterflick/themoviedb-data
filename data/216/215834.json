In a country where a cadaver may serve as license for holding a sakla operation (illegal gambling) in wakes, people may exploit the dead in order to generate income from the profits of gambling, and possibly pay for its burial.  In Oros, a funeral parlor owner sells an unidentified body to Makoy, a kasero in a saklaan, who, along with his reluctant brother, Abet, set the stage for a three-week long fake wake holding the illegal saklaan.  The sakla personnel deals with everyone involved, including Linda, an impoverished homeowner, as they agree upon a fictional story which will “legitimize” the wake.","popularity":0.1487,"poster_path":"/zUwOzVx2xwqyWWwHefijaDwy6j9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death is a treasure.","title":"The Coin Bearer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Gomez","original_name":"Tanya Gomez","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/2zhNuuCzkUF5xzjfW5byTYiJzd6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e0ac3a368484e20af27","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristoffer Martin","original_name":"Kristoffer Martin","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/wfzDC35JGZgY2ExytXTdxwWwSgH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e0ac3a368484e20af2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristoffer King","original_name":"Kristoffer King","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/dU1vwHri198XFAGM4q4fb87R2IF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a3460ce925141547503071a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200448,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Sta.
