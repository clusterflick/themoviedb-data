The film concerns a couple visiting Vermont in order to be married, and interviewing local residents on the subject of marriage. Largely improvised and using non-professional actors, the film was shown at various film festivals including the Melbourne International Film Festival and the Hawaii International Film Festival. The movie was not very well-received by the national press, with the New York Times calling it, “vaguely amiable.” While the Washington Post review commented that the film was an “all-too-easy target for ridicule,” it also mentioned one of the film’s high points: “In one scene, a typically droll Vermont resident (playing himself) sums up his state’s fabled coolness to strangers by suggesting that a sign be placed at the state line, reading ‘Welcome to Vermont. Now Leave.’”","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/dBiufr6Xow23YvQjSRGgd0xAvu5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitgeist Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vermont Is for Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Thrush","original_name":"George Thrush","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"George","credit_id":"52fe4df4c3a368484e206435","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marya Cohn","original_name":"Marya Cohn","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Marya","credit_id":"52fe4df4c3a368484e206439","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann O'Brien","original_name":"Ann O'Brien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"52fe4df4c3a368484e20643d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John O'Brien","original_name":"John O'Brien","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4df4c3a368484e20642b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153908,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John O'Brien","original_name":"John O'Brien","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4df4c3a368484e206431","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0105737","wikidata_id":"Q7921729","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dBiufr6Xow23YvQjSRGgd0xAvu5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
