A hand-held camera frames parts of sculptures, or moves across their surfaces, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, almost always in close-up. The soundtrack, in addition to the voice, is discordant music. Light and shadows are paramount. Sometimes the camera repeats up and down movements; once, a set of jump cuts brings an object closer. The music can be shrill in contrast to the sculptures. Almost entirely of wood, they are the work of Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988): Abstract, usually smooth and rounded (but not always).","popularity":0.1567,"poster_path":"/3fJwTo64NcPyLEuCerHufgR1U3V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gryphon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visual Variations on Noguchi","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Menken","original_name":"Marie Menken","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/3LH6BrMX63UEWXLkliITRWuVcCC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4df1c3a368484e205d81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607460,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucille Dlugoszewski","original_name":"Lucille Dlugoszewski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714dfe3c3a3682f45000083","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183426,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ralph Dorazio","original_name":"Ralph Dorazio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714dfef925141361600355a","department":"Crew","job":"Title Graphics"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1299084,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Isamu Noguchi","original_name":"Isamu Noguchi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5714e0009251413616003560","department":"Art","job":"Sculptor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1438476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fJwTo64NcPyLEuCerHufgR1U3V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8SZWoX0JUpvdtIHqewBSVYHUn0S.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
