It starred magician Doug Henning. Produced by Edgar Lansbury, it opened on May 28, 1974 at the Cort Theatre in Manhattan, and ran for 1,920 performances, closing on December 31, 1978. Henning was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and director Grover Dale was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical. In 2001, a filmed performance staged especially for the cameras in 1980, directed by Norman Campbell at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Toronto, was issued on DVD by Image Entertainment. This production, originally intended for cinema release, differed notably from the original Broadway production, with several of the most memorable songs, such as \"West End Avenue\" and \"Solid Silver Platform Shoes\", removed. Doug Henning reprised his original starring role, while Didi Conn co-starred as Cal.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/wJSvPYBvJzAswZGp4UqIC0sudNq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corinth Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young magician with an unorthodox look and style's first big break is threatened by a villainous rival.","title":"The Magic Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Henning","original_name":"Doug Henning","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/rLP4Eg7TBPHQrG7woZwHe46uPv4.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Doug","credit_id":"5b22f7a30e0a26244a00065f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didi Conn","original_name":"Didi Conn","popularity":0.5223,"profile_path":"/jaWZ3Yi05oPq4mT0kpVsCN3ktFE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cal","credit_id":"5b22f7b0c3a368795c00063b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":159753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Morris","original_name":"Anita Morris","popularity":0.2766,"profile_path":"/yxAThKmM3IHTcLKo5lULozhMXqI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Charmin","credit_id":"60f561c1c439c00072817ef1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Finlayson","original_name":"Jon Finlayson","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/493IDi0LMWj9IUCbH8Vioehglp1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Van Zyskin","credit_id":"5b7f25219251416c820003c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Creley","original_name":"Jack Creley","popularity":0.4192,"profile_path":"/269fKAcaZaTJtOXOrKv84LDBVAI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Shumway","credit_id":"6106953e7719d7002c9c1eb0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Schwartz","original_name":"Stephen Schwartz","popularity":0.7425,"profile_path":"/qpW74Zt3IpAGArMQigQz0vK0pR0.jpg","credit_id":"64395e5d37b3a900f32bc422","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Schwartz","original_name":"Stephen Schwartz","popularity":0.7425,"profile_path":"/qpW74Zt3IpAGArMQigQz0vK0pR0.jpg","credit_id":"64395e674a52f800b6fbcba9","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Schwartz","original_name":"Stephen Schwartz","popularity":0.7425,"profile_path":"/qpW74Zt3IpAGArMQigQz0vK0pR0.jpg","credit_id":"64395e711d538600f40fdd9a","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Schwartz","original_name":"Stephen Schwartz","popularity":0.7425,"profile_path":"/qpW74Zt3IpAGArMQigQz0vK0pR0.jpg","credit_id":"5b22f873c3a368795900050f","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Campbell","original_name":"Norman Campbell","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7f22599251416c84000186","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1221168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Randall","original_name":"Bob Randall","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7f226a9251416c8900016d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216939,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jerry Ross","original_name":"Jerry Ross","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7f22789251416c940001ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130103","wikidata_id":"Q128518133","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1204,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wJSvPYBvJzAswZGp4UqIC0sudNq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":803},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AeezvvChzOgRXhAk2uj9h54gVev.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":855}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2343,"name":"magic"},{"id":4344,"name":"musical"},{"id":156028,"name":"broadway"},{"id":246884,"name":"filmed theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
