However, things take a dark, nightmarish turn when a transvestite chases, catches and begins molesting a woman. Soon, all of the titular “creatures” participate in a (mostly clothed) orgy that causes a massive earthquake. After the creatures are killed in the resulting chaos, a vampire dressed like an old Hollywood starlet rises from her coffin to resurrect the dead. All ends happily enough when the now undead creatures dance with each other, even though another orgy and earthquake loom over the end title card.","popularity":0.4764,"poster_path":"/agXfZnar50z6v1DrGdzjgssuth7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
