When Spike commits a terrible crime, Heaton decides to stand by him - an act of astonishing, almost foolhardy loyalty. There begins a chase across a vast Northern landscape of moors, rivers and dark woods, the increasingly exhausted fugitives being hunted not by the police but by a posse of farmers intent on revenge. No ordinary chase film, This Is Not a Love Song is a love story trapped inside the body of a thriller.","popularity":1.4096,"poster_path":"/5CLDRTKobYT5ke1sauGjEXV4EwQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8094,"logo_path":null,"name":"Strange Dog","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not a Love Song","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Glenaan","original_name":"Kenneth Glenaan","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Heaton","credit_id":"62c8a3f9498bc200dd08ab37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1541147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Colgan","original_name":"Michael Colgan","popularity":0.192,"profile_path":"/xtyM1UWL3m2uabbLx6ujcwBwJ6m.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Spike","credit_id":"62c8a42339a1a60068a6b1cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bradley","original_name":"David Bradley","popularity":1.2613,"profile_path":"/znpkwHitb3pcaJbUmgDqG0YenYp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr Bellamy","credit_id":"62c8a47595665800fd271136","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Henshaw","original_name":"John Henshaw","popularity":0.4859,"profile_path":"/tccV2fiYQujBGk7KDpRJfYgM7lQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Arthur","credit_id":"62c8a49cede1b0004f7bc61b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3616854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Pepper","original_name":"Adam Pepper","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"William","credit_id":"62c8a52ee8131d0055a7b596","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1656138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keri Arnold","original_name":"Keri Arnold","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gerry","credit_id":"62c8a551976a23004f35a159","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1800769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Middleton","original_name":"Chris Middleton","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"62c8a578e8131d0071b346cb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bille Eltringham","original_name":"Bille Eltringham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/a5G9063Ap1jgbW0ow5S50uUDtBm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4734c3a36847f8128d39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57631,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Beaufoy","original_name":"Simon Beaufoy","popularity":0.2236,"profile_path":"/sKFdQnGvtCQSCblBIBqcaciXHsw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4734c3a36847f8128d3f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71086,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robbie Ryan","original_name":"Robbie Ryan","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/qYbGiIVFjUdPIYXWeWIeDI9xTfr.jpg","credit_id":"62e3225e68b766005864ba27","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70525,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Ogborn","original_name":"Kate Ogborn","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbff7420e0a266e5b00c501","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0310224","wikidata_id":"Q7785921","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5CLDRTKobYT5ke1sauGjEXV4EwQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
