In 1972, the Stones bring their Exile on Main Street tour to Texas: 15 songs, with five from the \"Exile\" album. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman on a small stage with three other musicians. Until the lights come up near the end, we see the Stones against a black background. The camera stays mostly on Jagger, with a few shots of Taylor. Richards is on screen for his duets and for some guitar work on the final two songs. It's music from start to finish: hard rock (\"All Down the Line\"), the blues (\"Love in Vain\" and \"Midnight Rambler\"), a tribute to Chuck Berry (\"Bye Bye Johnny\"), and no \"Satisfaction.\"","popularity":1.731,"poster_path":"/27LUODpq70OJ6jxclGCy3kFbC58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ladies & Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones","video":false,"vote_average":5.625,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones","type":"Movie"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Ladies & Gentlemen -
