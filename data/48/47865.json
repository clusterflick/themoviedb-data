The King spends all his time on the platform of the knight's tower or at the famous 'round table'. The women figure that only the good old wizard Merlin can help. Merlin sends Guinevere a powerful magic potion that will help her win back Arthur's love. The ladies bake the potion into a pudding, but it is accidentally eaten by Arthur's favorite knight, Lancelot. To complicate matters, Peggy is in love with Lancelot, but the knight's overdose of magic causes him to fall madly in love with the queen.","popularity":0.2253,"poster_path":"/tJj0DkpVONabN92Q9S0hWtXJbRk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pannónia
