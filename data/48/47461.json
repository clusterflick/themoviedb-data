Off-screen, a voice recites fragments of oracular literature and purple prose. We see an eye, an ear, a mouth, a tongue, bits of hair, a hand, the tips of fingers, toes. Occasionally, the frame includes a larger scape of a body: a chest, a back, a breast. Usually the camera is stationery; sometimes, it moves across a body, remaining in close up. They hold hands for one moment. The bodies are without clothes; no genitalia are visible.","popularity":0.4958,"poster_path":"/lSVv7trJ6WIiKDAsm4jrN2YSH63.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Geography of the Body","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Geog Raphy of the Body","type":"On-screen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Barker","original_name":"George Barker","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator / Body","credit_id":"553276969251415295002db6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willard Maas","original_name":"Willard Maas","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/cdUt2AjkaTJAMdQovoAr6WlQVn6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Body","credit_id":"553276a3925141529b002cd9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Menken","original_name":"Marie Menken","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/3LH6BrMX63UEWXLkliITRWuVcCC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Body","credit_id":"553276b29251415291002cd5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willard Maas","original_name":"Willard Maas","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/cdUt2AjkaTJAMdQovoAr6WlQVn6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4734c3a36847f8128dd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Menken","original_name":"Marie Menken","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/3LH6BrMX63UEWXLkliITRWuVcCC.jpg","credit_id":"553276c2c3a3682219002f39","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0305597","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kNCp33TwjRoFZxdDRkdxkvlT6ZH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSVv7trJ6WIiKDAsm4jrN2YSH63.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2132,"name":"literature"},{"id":3722,"name":"human body"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
