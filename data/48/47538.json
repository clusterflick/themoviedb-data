Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was held in Coburg, Germany, at June 16–17, 2003. It lasted 2 days, with the band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations through the Looking Glass in June 14, 2004.","popularity":0.1982,"poster_path":"/wThiTfbvJfWX1nTnvnMal4t9AnS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgin Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Guardian: Imaginations Through the Looking Glass","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hansi Kürsch","original_name":"Hansi Kürsch","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/zBhGqmQ8Ng0PjtqAOHDwm4RL5Q3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cd05f7d0e0a262fcd08b16d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Olbrich","original_name":"André Olbrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cd05f8a0e0a2631b802b24e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Siepen","original_name":"Marcus Siepen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cd05f959251414f7c29e2c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomen \"The Omen\" Stauch","original_name":"Thomen \"The Omen\" Stauch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cd05fcc92514104812deedd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Holzwarth","original_name":"Oliver Holzwarth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cd05fd9c3a368472dd97c00","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mi Schüren","original_name":"Mi Schüren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cd05ff99251417cce2bca91","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Knézy-Bohm","original_name":"Matthias Knézy-Bohm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd05f6b0e0a2609810185d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306480,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vli Blämker","original_name":"Vli Blämker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd07e28c3a3681fd7d8f3a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306481,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vasco Tjong-Ayong","original_name":"Vasco Tjong-Ayong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd07e419251410650257fd0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wThiTfbvJfWX1nTnvnMal4t9AnS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2DAGxz55zOtyi4TIy622GWnE8SA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aRYN1mJyy8QorQStCKTfxovM7mY.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
