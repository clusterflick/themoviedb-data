Her thoughts drift back to that summer ... to bathing in the hot springs ... to when they first met ... and embraced. Down Under - Australia, the desert, a blistering heat wave. His pickup stops at an icehouse ... he lays the blocks neatly on the buckboard ... and drives off haunted by a aching memory. Without dialogue or comment, save for verses from a sonnet by John Keats, Fridrik Thor Fridriksson links the thoughts, the emotions, the sensual longing of young lovers at opposite ends of the world. A tone poem, a collage of sight and sound.","popularity":0.1345,"poster_path":"/t57XG3QIUYeNNuXsP4Nj9Ex7PhT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2002-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Top Down Under","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die schönste Sache der Welt - On Top Down Under","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Erotic Tales: On Top Down Under","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Nina Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"5a5c4c8e925141322c005aa6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason","original_name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/iq5hffgLNz7JEqqUIWdNCV3aegx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"5fd838b91f3e60003fb18686","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4724c3a36847f812577f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"5d42ad927719d7001463243b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0265458","wikidata_id":"Q20077133","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zLZxGAKrcxQY9JF3ZJGfRdzFmFF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t57XG3QIUYeNNuXsP4Nj9Ex7PhT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Montréal Film Festival","release_date":"2002-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
