Three young men merrily bop through the wreckage of razed buildings at the site of what would become Lincoln Center. Apparently, Scotch Tape was never edited and, instead, was cut in the camera by Smith, combining long shots and close-ups while filming mostly from overhead. The title comes from a small strip of scotch tape that was accidentally stuck on the camera and so is visible in the lower-right corner of the frame throughout the film.","popularity":0.1041,"poster_path":"/7VlSbuz1ada1H5brMynHMz7QluQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scotch Tape","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reese Haire","original_name":"Reese Haire","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4726c3a36847f8125e8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4726c3a36847f8125e91","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Sims","original_name":"Jerry Sims","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4726c3a36847f8125e95","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Smith","original_name":"Jack Smith","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/wmcKDsXdH6MunekpYt5TnxM1RXE.jpg","credit_id":"5a0a53e4c3a368219c00d4c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0168159","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfUcfKnUlPhNOo2r1ItG7zyCBl7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7VlSbuz1ada1H5brMynHMz7QluQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
