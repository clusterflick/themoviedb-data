Much of this fluid was produced by one Atlanta-based company, and Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon offers a panegyric to the Real Thing. The history of Coke is the history of its advertising, and this documentary draws on a rich archive of print, film, and television material to show how John Pemberton's soda recipe became such a potent symbol of American society. Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon is, unsurprisingly, a one-sided history. There is no suggestion that the Coca-Colonization of the planet might have a downside, and lines like \"If the world's having a bad time, it's OK because there's still Coke\" are delivered without a hint of irony. Nevertheless, this documentary offers some fascinating insights into the history of Coca-Cola.","popularity":0.0527,"poster_path":"/3IxmQ32PGw3nwNnyHJyqvZ04UAn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Martin","original_name":"Jeff Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4720c3a36847f8124bcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Martin","original_name":"Jeff Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cabf9284934445442d5c2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2kTN79BMZRDplrEjyB99x1xCnVm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.738,"height":286,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jDo0wtcztzfSWeoNyDEYOtVcboS.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":783}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3IxmQ32PGw3nwNnyHJyqvZ04UAn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
