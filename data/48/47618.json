It was produced at the request of sportswear maker Adidas as a part of its \"Adicolor\" viral ads campaign, in which advertising agency Idealogue gathered seven directors, assigning a different color to each of them, and asked them to produce a feature based on their emotional and creative response to the given color, later to be distributed in the form of podcasts.  The four-minute film, shot by Trent Opaloch in Blomkamp's usual handheld camera mockumentary style, deals with an Israeli robotic globe-trotter gone rogue.","popularity":0.5489,"poster_path":"/3z0013isIwGxA5PA03qpNZv3mPz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4545,"logo_path":"/k9dErisrlWRJLvIkJYgKrIZVSnO.png","name":"RSA
