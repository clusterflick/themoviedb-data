Shea Stadium was closed (in part to create more parking space for a new stadium, Citi Field), and on July 16 and 18, 2008, Billy Joel headlined the final concerts held at the stadium. Filmmaker Paul Crowder and a camera crew were on hand for Joel's shows, and the documentary THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA chronicles his historic two-night stand, as well as exploring Joel's career, his ties to working-class New York, and how his life and career paralleled the growth of suburban Long Island and the beloved ballpark.","popularity":1.2531,"poster_path":"/xnnmPEZJrZCQdjJlrU6UJW75LUe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4183,"logo_path":"/bPOaJehJ43bEq1sip5jE1G53IEE.png","name":"Diamond Docs","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Joel - The Last Play at Shea","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec Baldwin","original_name":"Alec Baldwin","popularity":2.4905,"profile_path":"/hzKy7x574eeUS3wt1R3yvWBRpeR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4735c3a36847f812920d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Bennett","original_name":"Tony Bennett","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/gcbLJMKNsbhkvOobTDOT7DfdDZF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4735c3a36847f8129211","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garth Brooks","original_name":"Garth Brooks","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/dN4cOZDdnkIknPDn7E6cjVuJjkX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4735c3a36847f8129215","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Daltrey","original_name":"Roger Daltrey","popularity":0.7913,"profile_path":"/wQUIoUytxAoqaMpq2jW51v4CLhJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4735c3a36847f8129219","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Joel","original_name":"Billy Joel","popularity":0.3871,"profile_path":"/wXlIKgFnXK2Af6cetw9oF0kGcRc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64a5f43d0398ab014edeceb1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4016530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Green","original_name":"Gary Green","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e0dd0c5ab81a00ad212b59","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682539,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roderick A.
