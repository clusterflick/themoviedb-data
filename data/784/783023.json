All material contained herein is 100% live. There are no overdubs of any kind.  Live album (Tilburg, 18.10.2015), sold only during the concerts from Towards The Blue Horizon Tour 2017 Issued in gatefold mini-LP sleeve pack (every disc in separate cardboard sleeve).  From the band: \"It was a remarkable concert. During the \"Love, Fear and the Time Machine Tour 2015\", the band were in excellent shape, and although we were promoting our more \"song-oriented side\", we played such compositions as \"Hyperactive\" or \"Egoist Hedonist\". On top of that, there is a 20-minute version of \"Escalator Shrine\" and a special, unique version of \"The Same River\" with a modified intro. The fact that it was one of the last concerts with Piotr Grudziński makes it even more emotional and memorable.\"","popularity":0.0794,"poster_path":"/iGBABgxNUbU5dqus3ial5C3ZTS4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riverside - Lost 'n' Found - Live in Tilburg","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2174038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Grudziński","original_name":"Piotr Grudziński","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/31LsmxTGHtWNbMkCu6pLQoJ0mpX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"5ff37d861a934f003f140e29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2174035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariusz Duda","original_name":"Mariusz Duda","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/fdxowDzMBSYy8DZcmzoWQTnOTzF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"lead vocals, bass guitar, acoustic guitar","credit_id":"5ff37db021118f003f28624b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Kozieradzki","original_name":"Piotr Kozieradzki","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/aUPj0C3eFWy9mJZcg8BvnPxRKCv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5ff37e0bfbe36f003ff94848","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michał Łapaj","original_name":"Michał Łapaj","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iqpzQxIuOutnyBkjQg0jGqgfKO5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Keyboards, backing vocals","credit_id":"5ff37e3d31d09b00406031ae","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iGBABgxNUbU5dqus3ial5C3ZTS4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tJ8X58X5bxuHDA01tM1eZZGgojN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Engels\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"Engels\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
