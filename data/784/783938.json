In the midst of this ecologically violent shift, communities are being ripped apart physically, economically and emotionally. The third poorest state in the nation, Paul Corbit Brown, president of Keepers of the Mountain explains the situation. “People here feel very isolated, they feel very forgotten. They feel very neglected, abandoned, abused – and hungry. For more than just food.” It's no surprise then that West Virginia is ranked number one in the opioid crisis. It's not surprising that forgotten folks have latched on to the lies and propaganda peddled by the likes of Trump.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tkeqZE8DDKoTq9I86oxih51tyzH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hard Road of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3208290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleanor Goldfield","original_name":"Eleanor Goldfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61227b3cd4b9d9005b487cf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":2090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tkeqZE8DDKoTq9I86oxih51tyzH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1408}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
