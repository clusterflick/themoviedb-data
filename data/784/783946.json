Their Red Rocks foray follows the form of the classic Gaither manifestation-the family hosts performances by longtime favorites such as Wesley Pritchard, whose \"I Never Shall Forget the Day\" is a particular highlight, and Donnie Sumner, who contributes a delicate, moving \"The Anchor Holds.\" As a celebration of traditional religious values, the HOMECOMING series is perhaps unequalled in contemporary worship music. RED ROCKS HOMECOMING is a fine example of the Gaither Family and its satellite members doing what they do best--singing simple, unadorned, traditional songs of praise.","popularity":0.9626,"poster_path":"/6q0nmFuDUDTVrbmooOLD8qfAi5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89341,"logo_path":"/9AFIfoY73ThHx19EEWdLnyVJsbP.png","name":"Gaither Television Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Rocks Homecoming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Gaither","original_name":"Bill Gaither","popularity":0.3835,"profile_path":"/ciC6nhZjAMfAg9YfVZ9f4kM2YVM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b811fcec2e0040129e2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":974363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Gaither","original_name":"Gloria Gaither","popularity":0.2318,"profile_path":"/c1oSwworwRY2ihYgCYibr26FnFe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b81761bac4003ea744ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Parker","original_name":"Ivan Parker","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/eoow6zYzu9j4AMWy3UJBkvLbqCO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b81cbbcae0003eac5761","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Phelps","original_name":"David Phelps","popularity":0.2065,"profile_path":"/lpuvtW3S4d6ZrqFCciecCObkrxI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b834fcec2e004112544a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Lowry","original_name":"Mark Lowry","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/jNqwQTlAPCZJf7xLQjOHuNBhWVb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b8397f1d830040f213ac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Penrod","original_name":"Guy Penrod","popularity":0.2802,"profile_path":"/pE7v2AocUfp1p8Mcg43o3G1KOzy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b840a0be2800408a666b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russ Taff","original_name":"Russ Taff","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/uJyae0Cu3KRamhtoVK6qxW1B02f.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b84bfdc4fa0040cd2bb0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Hess","original_name":"Jake Hess","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/x3kBZQA1I3e9VcgjFtKP9fAndM7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b862fcec2e003f12c549","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Allen","original_name":"Mike Allen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b867bbcae00041ac2d05","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reggie Smith","original_name":"Reggie Smith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/v6M8ZPz7Y4OA9oRWbqPdbhKqbuO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff7b86e61bac4003ea7450e","order":9}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2143,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6q0nmFuDUDTVrbmooOLD8qfAi5g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156064,"name":"homecoming"},{"id":191541,"name":"gaither"},{"id":206271,"name":"southern gospel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
