However, the wildlife diversity is threatened as human activity encroaches on their fragile wilderness. This film follows the meandering lowland rivers which drain into the vast floodplains, photographs the mighty cascading waterfalls and frames the picturesque warm, limestone springs and fertile landscape of the Karlovac region. Our camera flies across the interior valleys or 'Karst Polje' which form shallow basins for the annual rainfall that swell the underground waterways to resurface as gentle rivers and streams many kilometres away.We also see majestic Adriatic rivers flow to meet the sea, through the fast moving estuaries of the great Zrmanja canyon or through the mighty Neretva delta.","popularity":0.0464,"poster_path":"/bESIVZRmlyP67tUyxU8cxdVzAL7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivers of Croatia","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Kroatien Viele Flüsse, reiche Fauna","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","title":"Zeleni krvotok Hrvatske","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Croatie au fil de l'eau","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Ríos de Croacia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.
