In this way, the pornographic attraction of \"The Confessor\" is built through the perversion of the priestly vow of celibacy and the sacrament of penance. This film can be considered as another chapter in the cultural tradition of criticizing the vices of the clergy, and as a consequence of the environment and the new leisure culture that took place in the Europe of the so-called \"frivolous twenties\".","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/5lBxdfNsy5JIGOReq3d7SWjOVgv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confessor","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ramón de Baños","original_name":"Ramón de Baños","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603c312770700014908477b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo de Baños","original_name":"Ricardo de Baños","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6603c330d38b58017d1beaa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2344658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Alfonso XIII of Spain","original_name":"King Alfonso XIII of Spain","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/gUVe8Xvy4dPWx0HbXzaTLSkFsZv.jpg","credit_id":"670b0d44bbb1a9e81c61c574","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10773712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1452,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5lBxdfNsy5JIGOReq3d7SWjOVgv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":968}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
