Armed with a camera, Yael Abecassis followed her mother and stepped into a world where she had always been a stranger. \"You know, daughter, Morocco is a kind of therapy,\" Raymonde says, and for the first time, they embark on a journey together: from a childhood in the mellah of Casablanca to the dunes of Ashdod and back to Morocco, where the mother became the legendary Raymonde El Bidaoia - a world-famous Moroccan singer. As they journey, Yael discovers a woman who articulates her weaknesses and the complexities of her choices with keen self-awareness, even when mother and daughter are transposed, twined together by guilt, admiration, pain, and above all else - limitless love and music.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/k6YJUYEbvAEv10gN94xt55SzMrA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raymonde El Bidaoia","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymonde Abecassis","original_name":"Raymonde Abecassis","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff5aaf0c2ff3d003dff440d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaël Abecassis","original_name":"Yaël Abecassis","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/2Z6RCeQWU1dSiJW83abMaYBS86h.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff5acd2f48e0d003f72d865","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaël Abecassis","original_name":"Yaël Abecassis","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/2Z6RCeQWU1dSiJW83abMaYBS86h.jpg","credit_id":"5ff5aab0d38b580041cbb1b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703710,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hillel Roseman","original_name":"Hillel Roseman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff5ab30b865eb003cb1e688","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaël Abecassis","original_name":"Yaël Abecassis","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/2Z6RCeQWU1dSiJW83abMaYBS86h.jpg","credit_id":"5ff5ab1e28723c0040af8e4e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13027368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2FiFXvn4fzD2MBWp8cA4CgOnXK1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/k6YJUYEbvAEv10gN94xt55SzMrA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1716,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/2JQzlysdJR4Sa7x1b4k4ors8OfP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
