The camera was turned off only when it ran out of film. It was shot sync-sound fixed camera. The movie goers could see the camera clearly (no Allen-Funt cute). Like Monet's cathedral, this same image would never have been the same again. The image is composed of complex, multilayered planes of focus. And I love the way people ask for popcorn and tap their dollar bills. Film time and real time are the same.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vestal Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1935430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Kaplan","original_name":"Helene Kaplan","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff648fad6c3000040579065","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
