Didier Cros’ moving, intimate film forces us to question what underlies our notions of beauty as we join a talented photographer taking stunning portraits of several people with profound visible scars which have dictated certain elements of their lives but have not come to define their humanity. The subjects' perceptions of themselves are dynamic, unexpected, and even heartwarming. This is an unforgettable journey to be shared with the world.","popularity":0.4255,"poster_path":"/qeZTJiihQMGoDUiU7hK9s5446Hb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18740,"logo_path":"/11dLmhNuO6Pgd8tSDvktsOkP94R.png","name":"Zadig Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are you afraid to look at a different face?","title":"Scars","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Scars","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Scars","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798153,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Remy Revellin","original_name":"Remy Revellin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff58583abf8e200416904b5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1847112,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Romain Cadilhac","original_name":"Romain Cadilhac","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff585cbf056d5003df8108b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1934287,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Bataille","original_name":"Thomas Bataille","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff585661443f40046f952ba","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Magnier","original_name":"Vincent Magnier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff585b4e78687003e41b473","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emmanuel Cabanes","original_name":"Emmanuel Cabanes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff58911f48e0d0040724489","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laurent Didier","original_name":"Laurent Didier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff58597f48e0d00407241fa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2081668,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvain Delecroix","original_name":"Sylvain Delecroix","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff58605245dbe003c2ff52c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Cros","original_name":"Didier Cros","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff5852a245dbe003f2f8dbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2140799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Depardon","original_name":"Olivier Depardon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff5892728723c003fafb92b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqLdsOMEFGufU4qCzvFntj2RjQj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2719,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qeZTJiihQMGoDUiU7hK9s5446Hb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z43GpAPnbgLVJVaElaBf4YJN5FK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1087,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ktnl85469lMZQey7tPhxPDSx7iy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3679,"name":"society"},{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":3011,"name":"exclusion"},{"id":3722,"name":"human body"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
