Made in Chinatown is a street film in which the human presence is represented only indirectly and in fragments, either through its reflection in shop windows, cars, and other surfaces, or through the shadows it casts. There is nothing extraneous here, nothing which upsets the film’s fragile, delicate balance between what is physically substantial and the immaterial traces of that substantiality.” -Nathaniel Dorsky","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/t9o7zEM6SfVxlQ7An6Kpo58jmEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Made in Chinatown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jennings","original_name":"Jim Jennings","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/msfx2Tb9rP4KSAHI09SICAg4w9R.jpg","credit_id":"62c325d822e4802ab37caa22","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jennings","original_name":"Jim Jennings","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/msfx2Tb9rP4KSAHI09SICAg4w9R.jpg","credit_id":"62c325fb0443c9005abac67a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jennings","original_name":"Jim Jennings","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/msfx2Tb9rP4KSAHI09SICAg4w9R.jpg","credit_id":"62c325d222e4802ab4edfa21","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jennings","original_name":"Jim Jennings","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/msfx2Tb9rP4KSAHI09SICAg4w9R.jpg","credit_id":"5ff472ca549dda003f9b9c0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6347296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9o7zEM6SfVxlQ7An6Kpo58jmEF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iLdE4KIms7tPiQzWKmY9IeMmWWk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Views from the Avant-Garde 2005","release_date":"2005-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
