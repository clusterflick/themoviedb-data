A relentless circling around the establishment of guilt, underpinned by a soundtrack of techno beats that hit you in the gut. Ignas Krunglevicius' two-channel video installation is based on real-life police records: Detective Robert John is questioning murder suspect Mary Kovik. She is accused of killing her husband with his own shotgun. In the video, the people speaking can neither be seen nor heard. They are present only in the form of their words, which appear in the frame in written form, as if on an autocue. In this way, Krunglevicius - also a composer and musician - draws attention to the language of power and to the mechanisms of manipulation and coercion.  At the same time, he explores the activation of the imagination as an important prerequisite for empathy.","popularity":0.1116,"poster_path":"/8dpJTjTSwvtUNqpd85jkb9C2EqY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interrogation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","original_name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67d5620d31678cc3f80122aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kovik","original_name":"Mary Kovik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Kovik","credit_id":"67d5621c790d78633a012215","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert John","original_name":"Robert John","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Detective","credit_id":"67d5622f13d0e96b427ba378","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kovik","original_name":"Mary Kovik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67d5623513d0e96b427ba380","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770832,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","original_name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5623e31538de608f169b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770832,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","original_name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d562485963ebffde7bb164","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770832,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","original_name":"Ignas Krunglevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5625131538de608f169be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9SE1ToCTQKyhqYGIouYKpYnBEl5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8dpJTjTSwvtUNqpd85jkb9C2EqY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":278437,"name":"text"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"INTERROGATION","key":"52285861","site":"Vimeo","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-10-27T13:21:27.000Z","id":"67d562db0525f3d74f012a8c"}]}}}
