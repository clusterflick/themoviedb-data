The replicas were produced in Palestine with local artisans, the Twam family, and an anonymous family that works in the black market to make and sell forgeries. The original vessels in the glass gallery are replaced with tomb cards that narrate the violence of exhuming bodies to retrieve the \"grave goods\" and illustrate the power of the female body in the history of archaeology. The installation was accompanied by an experimental film that stitches personal histories with the history of glass.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":256320,"logo_path":null,"name":"V&A Jameel Fellowship","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Still Wears Kohl and Smells Like Roses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dima Srouji","original_name":"Dima Srouji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d47f14baf24b679ea98922","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Design Festival 2023","release_date":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
