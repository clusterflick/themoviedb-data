The film’s core value lies in its ability to provide an inside look at selected subcultures, achieving an exceptional level of engagement with their members. The filmmakers managed to break through the participants' initial reluctance to openly discuss their experiences.  The documentary directly addresses key aspects of these subcultures, including drugs, faith, and personal beliefs. It focuses on six specific groups: the techno scene, graffiti artists, antifascists, religiously oriented youth, skinheads, and young people inspired by Eastern spirituality. The film includes footage from illegal rave parties, graffiti sessions, and other underground activities. Overall, the documentary serves as an insightful map of Bratislava’s contemporary alternative scene.","popularity":0.2091,"poster_path":"/3lZMqUCexGsJVyK02dYmtt0wm34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A raw and unfiltered look into the underground subcultures of Bratislava.","title":"Propeler - subkultúry mládeže","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paľo Korec","original_name":"Pavol Korec","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4d5a124b7ebc3767b9292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paľo Korec","original_name":"Pavol Korec","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4d5ee31538de608f14928","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305169,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jana Žilčayová","original_name":"Jana Žilčayová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4d60813d0e96b427b9083","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3617493,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ján Meliš","original_name":"Ján Meliš","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4d6270525f3d74f011056","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Braňo Špaček","original_name":"Braňo Špaček","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4d6350525f3d74f01105c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Kordač","original_name":"Peter Kordač","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4d64a411f90fecdf14edd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":842,"iso_639_1":"sk","file_path":"/3lZMqUCexGsJVyK02dYmtt0wm34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":595}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":3540,"name":"bratislava, slovakia"},{"id":3627,"name":"techno"},{"id":155418,"name":"subculture"},{"id":193904,"name":"alternative lifestyle"},{"id":231020,"name":"anti-fascism"},{"id":233950,"name":"skinheads"},{"id":281463,"name":"social study"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":290672,"name":"slovakia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Propeler","key":"qIwgi-By2mI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-02-26T01:16:12.000Z","id":"67d4d813411f90fecdf14f74"}]}}}
