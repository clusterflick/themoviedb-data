At its heart stands Adela Hernandez, a trailblazing trans politician who rose from the dark days of UMAP  imprisonment to become the first transgender person in Cuba's government.  Alongside her, the charismatic Ramon Silverio transforms his cultural haven El  Mejunje into ground zero for change, taking his rainbow-colored caravan of artists  and performers deep into the countryside to challenge prejudice through the universal language of art. As archival footage reveals how machismo and religious  bigotry cast a long shadow over the queer community but then a new generation of firebrands - Las Isabellas and Ulises Suarez - picks up the torch, and charges  toward the historic 2022 marriage equality victory that would finally let love win in  revolutionary Cuba.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/mm8OZ6vJDRsLRwIqmvlsURfkIts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Equality
