These multiplexes steer a diverse public through branching hallways to imaginary worlds, where the labyrinth shatters into glowing handheld screens.  Designed as a movie for phones, PLEX is an architectural model of an endless cinema, made from a set of twenty black cube interiors filled with colored screens and artificial lobby music. A spiraling camera path connects the cube units into a free-form structure that occasionally loops back on itself, creating intersections of cascading screens. An external view would reveal a chain of cubes endlessly exploring a 3D grid of possibilities.  The cubes play like wind chimes, blown by chance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fg93GWjKZnsG4Mb9zBbDDTfFMJi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plex","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d464dbe9e5846a3f028db4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304439,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Zoe Knass","original_name":"Elizabeth Zoe Knass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d46754bf4818854c65185e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Holger Lang","original_name":"Holger Lang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d46765bf4818854c651876","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300308,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Casper McElwee","original_name":"Casper McElwee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d46773fac1630c2602a32b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d46799914de8d89102a23f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d467a3fac1630c2602a34a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fg93GWjKZnsG4Mb9zBbDDTfFMJi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
