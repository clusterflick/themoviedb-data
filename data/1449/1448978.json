A dialectical palimpsest between tradition and symbol. The atavistic is insinuated in the texture of primordial gestures, in topographies charged with telluric resonances, and in relics that exude an almost oracular collective memory; meanwhile, the artistic rises as an act of profanation and genesis, reconfiguring such vestiges in a dance of ruptures and epiphanies. Through a fragmentary narrative that disdains the vulgarity of conventional cohesion, the work interrogates the construction of the ego at the intersection between remembrance and mnemonic twilight, between the roots that constrain and the aspirations that sublimate. A speculative cenotaph, summoning the viewer to an introspective exegesis of his own reflection in the abyss.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"What is documented is fiction.
