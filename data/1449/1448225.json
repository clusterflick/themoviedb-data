They bring it aboard only to find it is missing one of its two power cells, and four symbols carved into the interior walls. The engines suddenly ignite, and Commander Moran is killed. Later, the crew finds two ghostly figures, Moran and an unidentified alien, roaming during the night cycle, soundlessly chanting before turning to attack the crew. The crew take shelter in the base's Faraday cage which the ghosts cannot enter.","popularity":0.9605,"poster_path":"/nt5Dh2VuZ3IKQnoj9MrL5ZiqMMN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor Who : Under the Lake / Before The Flood","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Capaldi","original_name":"Peter Capaldi","popularity":1.1237,"profile_path":"/uv5oQXq7uI6X82W6OowDM0l4qmD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Twelfth Doctor","credit_id":"67d40eb9506cc90d64027a02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenna Coleman","original_name":"Jenna Coleman","popularity":1.6894,"profile_path":"/9W77ENR6EAFbg8UjgeAl3F43rFy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clara Oswald","credit_id":"67d40ed7dcba70a26964f381","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin McFarlane","original_name":"Colin McFarlane","popularity":0.4546,"profile_path":"/tCLiWpKooSQJfyC260qNeNYTe9S.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Moran","credit_id":"67d40ee562e7d2336353b88b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1515606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Stone","original_name":"Sophie Stone","popularity":0.4593,"profile_path":"/vKxH5hMFnLNqVho4BGvNWlKMMvw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cass","credit_id":"67d40ef7914de8d891028ff2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1515607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaqi Ismail","original_name":"Zaqi Ismail","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":"/jv0IDqKDY064FVAsyuYFSz4TCMr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lunn","credit_id":"67d40f09506cc90d64027a1c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morven Christie","original_name":"Morven Christie","popularity":0.6597,"profile_path":"/fTlG9uWyaiQt9UATyPYswjo9EGh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"O'Donnell","credit_id":"67d40f1b914de8d891029006","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":814200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arsher Ali","original_name":"Arsher Ali","popularity":0.2881,"profile_path":"/vT4N5Fw5bKblS6yC5i9EdiIDYZg.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bennett","credit_id":"67d40f34ec4ebd28a253bd3b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel O'Hara","original_name":"Daniel O'Hara","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d40e12dcba70a26964f34c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216401,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toby Whithouse","original_name":"Toby Whithouse","popularity":0.1988,"profile_path":"/4NodpDFSaY2QH65WEbTEjdcKGL6.jpg","credit_id":"67d40e2d00bbfe6a7553bb17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47203,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Murray Gold","original_name":"Murray Gold","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/ih1ELPTC9QMDbK2KxskidkRqMFM.jpg","credit_id":"67d40e3cbf4818854c650023","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jRKu71kmdnevhh2eW9D1hvcKKOq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nt5Dh2VuZ3IKQnoj9MrL5ZiqMMN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":828},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j3UfeHGVmPx5G9vNBQKROF5weOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x7XiG6bOwhrLVHwjTRnO8gKAFJ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
