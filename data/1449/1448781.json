During the 1970s, actress Mariko Miyagi became heavily involved in the Silk Tree Academy (Nemunoki Gakuen), a rehabilitation center for disabled children. She appeared in several live-action films to promote the project, including The Silk Tree Ballad, Mariko-Mother, and Children Drawing Rainbows. This anime charts the 14-year period of Miyagi's stewardship of the academy and her relationships with several of the children. Divided into four seasonal chapters, the film uses highly realistic character designs based on the actual people involved and features storyboarding from versatile Battle Spaceship Yamato director Noboru Ishiguro.","popularity":0.0515,"poster_path":"/tkcESHkB0l48EuRq0TWDjLKYTlz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Love Letter: Mariko And The Children Of The Silk Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chiisana Love Letter: Mariko to Nemunoki no Kodomo-tachi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuzo Ishida","original_name":"Yuzo Ishida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d52cde577665ace5f15596","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tkcESHkB0l48EuRq0TWDjLKYTlz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1981-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
