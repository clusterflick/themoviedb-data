What was broken is made whole, what was wounded is healed, and lives are restored. Having been pulled backward through time and made a witness to their own death along with all it caused, this person who gave up their life is forced to confront the hate they feel for themselves and the love they feel for their family. A fantasy story about depression, addiction, and the fragile hope of redemption.  It's a symbolic tour of how our darkness, like a parasite, moves from host to host. It's a puzzle box with crumbs of detail and meaning that the observant viewer can sew together to deduce what more story there is outside of the frame. It’s an ambigram that unfolds both forward and backward—a fractured dream that, in the end, the viewer pieces together alongside the witness.  The song—written, performed, and produced by Kai Straw—and the video—written, edited, and shot by him—comes together as a uniquely singular vision.","popularity":0.1743,"poster_path":"/gJk4iAEofbejYauq4uCna7gS5yf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chokin'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3681384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serra
