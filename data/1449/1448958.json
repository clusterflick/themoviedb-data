From dimly lit staircases to the dreamlike glow of neon, FINAL is more than just a venue—it’s a cultural movement. This is where boundaries are pushed, genres are reimagined, and self-expression takes center stage. Through the voices of its founders, DJs, and the wider creative community, the film explores how FINAL became a sanctuary for experimentation, a home for those seeking freedom beyond the mainstream.  Shot entirely in Taipei, the film captures the raw energy of the city: its chaotic streets, intimate club spaces, and the relentless spirit of a scene that thrives against the odds. It’s a story of resilience, identity, and the power of music to bring people together, even in the face of challenges like the pandemic.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fnjYFsoFfX2WnwX6r42cMbjAnkz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2025-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boiler Room X FINAL Taipei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2579518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiao-Wei Lu","original_name":"Xiao-Wei Lu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mrk3iArFUZqABsQU021j60OAfrf.jpg","credit_id":"67d596e331678cc3f8013ac9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2579518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiao-Wei Lu","original_name":"Xiao-Wei Lu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mrk3iArFUZqABsQU021j60OAfrf.jpg","credit_id":"67d596f9191868c54ff15c6f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hmkLq6mu1oOziOJejsWTMMogZ1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fnjYFsoFfX2WnwX6r42cMbjAnkz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
