As these units are rearranged, each cut is equivalent to the toss a twelve-sided die.  If we perceive the wandererâ€™s movement from shot to shot as continuous, it will seem as if she is being tracked by numerous cameras positioned throughout a maze of unknown size. As our viewpoint constantly shifts to follow her path, a synthetic narrative emerges from random clips. The dreamer wanders endlessly.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zAglqm3XBMNuiMUqUaTi7DFNSOc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Alleys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsey Lapointe","original_name":"Kelsey Lapointe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"67d4662ee9e5846a3f028f01","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"67d465fef17459c8ff53d75a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rich O'Donnell","original_name":"Rich O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d46662914de8d89102a19f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5300308,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Casper McElwee","original_name":"Casper McElwee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d46675e9e5846a3f028f51","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304438,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Aaron Aubuchon","original_name":"Aaron Aubuchon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4669bbf4818854c651806","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304439,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Zoe Knass","original_name":"Elizabeth Zoe Knass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d466be00c85c5a28651199","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5304441,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Holger Lang","original_name":"Holger Lang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d466d362e7d2336353cb11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zAglqm3XBMNuiMUqUaTi7DFNSOc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
