To plant potatoes on the slope, the local people have to place a fistful of weed with the potato; otherwise it will roll down from the slope into the river.  Nujiang had been beyond social revolution, with no contact with the outside world but the annual relief by the government until the 1990s. In addition, having been isolated for a long time, the Nu people believe that Gods exist in the mountains, rivers and brushwood.  In 2000, with the promotion of the national poverty support policy and ecological protection policy in the Three Parallel River Area, Da Mashi's family was faced with a new option for survival. That's intriguing.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yhGnBw4t2A1oh0oBevn64TIyciV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family of Da Mashi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5303334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhou Weiping","original_name":"Zhou Weiping","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3acd2dcba70a26964e6b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yhGnBw4t2A1oh0oBevn64TIyciV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
