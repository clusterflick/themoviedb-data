He was known to the general public as a presenter of the VPRO Boeken program and also closer, with six collections of poetry to his name.  This documentary about his life and work, built entirely from archive material, pays tribute to this television personality. A portrait in which attention is also paid to his complicated relationship with death.  With a.o. Karl Ove Knausgård, David Sedaris, Ellen Deckwitz and Pieter Boskma. Brands' work merges with his rich inner life and that he chose death at the age of 56 casts a shadow over everything.","popularity":0.5948,"poster_path":"/4YJyujCYPBU4v2W9QET6VjW5bPb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strijdmakker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677101,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Wim Brands","original_name":"Wim Brands","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/pajKCZtxW7d1exSrNsZGWmeSlEz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self, archive material","credit_id":"67d344976b8cd9acc23e0d62","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Ove Knausgård","original_name":"Karl Ove Knausgård","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/2TcIU5cc3QHkgjyHZ6uGXPhXehj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d344a6cfb899019430f840","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sedaris","original_name":"David Sedaris","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/dsKXsIhzsB6HVUCe2pucKIupHc1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d344b2cfb899019430f84a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1028273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kleijwegt","original_name":"David Kleijwegt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d344d2cfb899019430f85d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Vroege","original_name":"Thomas Vroege","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3451c41ca4f51433e0989","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786036,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joost Oskamp","original_name":"Joost Oskamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3453341ca4f51433e099f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23582,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinier van Brummelen","original_name":"Reinier van Brummelen","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3456cdd12ee38607f54eb","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432242,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joyce Feijen","original_name":"Joyce Feijen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3458e41ca4f51433e09ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g1baBlWlF91LPSvr1LZ1E5ZenFd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4YJyujCYPBU4v2W9QET6VjW5bPb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":2132,"name":"literature"},{"id":1199,"name":"netherlands"},{"id":6964,"name":"tribute"},{"id":5757,"name":"public television"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":212894,"name":"eulogy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
