The Peacemaker Returns takes place in a time when the entire Earth has become a confederation of countries who truly recognize that we share one planet; that one person’s religion, language, sexuality, skin colour need not interfere with another’s; and that peace is not just the absence of war, it is the eradication of injustice. Now Earth has a new challenge, and Iotetshèn:’en, a young Mohawk woman, is travelling through space along with four other diplomats to a momentous rendez-vous.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peacemaker Returns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2912017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Skawennati","original_name":"Skawennati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d3976ffac1630c26027743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
