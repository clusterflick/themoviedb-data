Bloodroot, located in Bridgeport, Connecticut, is now the oldest and longest-running of these spaces, operating continuously for over 46 years. 'A Culinary Uprising: The Story of Bloodroot' is a short documentary that explores this feminist, queer, vegan restaurant and bookstore, highlighting the legacy of its pioneering proprietors, Selma Miriam and Noel Furie. The film offers an intimate look at their 46-year working partnership and how they navigate sexism, homophobia, and the realities of aging. Despite challenges, Bloodroot has endured as a beloved space for generations of feminists, vegans, and queer people who continue to return.","popularity":0.0554,"poster_path":"/2GE0BMuA4cQQJ8XNt7E50s3JnWB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Culinary Uprising: The Story of Bloodroot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5305135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selma Miriam","original_name":"Selma Miriam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4cf90411f90fecdf14be3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Furie","original_name":"Noel Furie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67d4cf990525f3d74f010eee","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809640,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annie Laurie Medonis","original_name":"Annie Laurie Medonis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4cf8024b7ebc3767b8f6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25457296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fc0Ff6SCiHbHFwz9VTCZXkVnhkE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2GE0BMuA4cQQJ8XNt7E50s3JnWB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Geelong Pride Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
