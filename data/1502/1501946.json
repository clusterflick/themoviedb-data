Made up of 42 members (20 of whom actually perform on stage), the Kodo group is seen training (four months each year, with eight months of touring) at Kodo village on the Japanese island of Sado, where the group had its origins in the early 1970s before officially naming itself \"Kodo\" in 1981.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9IcMoCMwOKZJsFScSSjgat5t9hF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kodō","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5519077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kodō Drummers","original_name":"Kodō Drummers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pL95qWZljPtGAgyjmo5Hnrn5bmW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6857132f4695d4563a036799","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29624250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9IcMoCMwOKZJsFScSSjgat5t9hF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VHS","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
