Written and directed by Gianna Cavarozzi and Lyanna Zammas, the film is composed of and created by a team of over 60 students, entirely grass-root and crowd-funded. Glory & Gore is an examination of wealth, class, cult mentalities, corruption, and masculinity through a feminine lens.  Glory & Gore, as you are able to view it today, is a proof of concept that its creators hope will become a greater feature film. As students working with limited time, funding, and resources, this film serves as a testament to all that this story can become. Its writers look forward to pursuing it, wherever it may take them.
