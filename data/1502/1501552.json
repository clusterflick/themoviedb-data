Captured in a grainy 5:4 frame that evokes the feel of a memory, this observational short film invites the viewer aboard a simple river cruise — not for grandeur, but for the fleeting poetry of sunlight on water, a breeze through aged stone. More impression than narrative, \"de Ouro\" gently reminds us that the smallest moments — like the river’s golden glimmer — are often the ones that stay with us, etched not in time, but in feeling.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lYlDir6NmLNbxABrNLMFoRfgVrJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where the light touches, the memory endures.","title":"of Gold","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mariana Silva","credit_id":"6855f4434ed15626a2cb46eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Silva","original_name":"Eduardo Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eduardo Silva","credit_id":"6855f45df8626067cca78f39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Moreira","original_name":"Sandra Moreira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sandra Moreira","credit_id":"6855f46f0058eb97d7fc71e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mário Silva","original_name":"Mário Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mário Silva","credit_id":"6855f47f3997b5a8b1fc71ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Pinho","original_name":"Teresa Pinho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Teresa Pinho","credit_id":"6855f490918c69c3d4cb46f2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Altino Silva","original_name":"Altino Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Altino Silva","credit_id":"6855f4a05345c31259ae16f9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f4ca023e2cda99492c19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f4de9d5d43d563fc728b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f4f182905cca9e53c63f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f5015d25629e0ccb46be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f50f15d445ecaacb46c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f51dd2be69c09c492c97","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f574656691ce18cb4673","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3535262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariana Silva","original_name":"Mariana Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6855f581125d252bb8cb46b7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/lYlDir6NmLNbxABrNLMFoRfgVrJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"Públicos","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
