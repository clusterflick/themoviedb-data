But under the new name of Famous Studios, a core group of artists kept at work - and brought a crazy cast of characters to life in Noveltoons a beautifully animated series of comedy and fantasy shorts. Now twenty of these classics are back, restored and remastered now in HD from original 35mm and 16mm film materials - brighter and more colorful than they've looked in decades. Famous stars like Raggedy Ann, Herman the Mouse, Blackie Sheep, and Baby Huey pop right off the screen... with anvils and shotguns in hand! Rediscover the Noveltoons or enjoy them for the first time!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z4h0r2lQdvZeGcEJu0m0M6cj7VX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":126251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thunderbean Animation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noveltoons: Original Classics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2806,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Buzzy Crow","credit_id":"6857345bbc662f227fcb4be2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.8289,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Little Audrey","credit_id":"6857347df47ff80fd44bce4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Shay","original_name":"Alan Shay","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Casper","credit_id":"685734a7db46044f27ded72f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Katnip","credit_id":"685734f441f2e4742da7939b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.2655,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"68573538fe50413f1f49308f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xwGZEu81yyAnzAEIutguB4jHoGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z4h0r2lQdvZeGcEJu0m0M6cj7VX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
