In the original Paramount cartoons, Casper would often frighten some unsuspecting grown-up while befriending \"Little Billy\" or a small animal, but he'd then rescue one of them from a perilous predicament to become a local hero. In the Harvey comics, Casper would explore an enchanted forest, while the antagonizing Ghostly Trio would tease and heckle. Friends like cousin Spooky, Wendy the Good Witch and Nightmare the Ghostly Horse round out Casper's supporting cast.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/54WXDi3L0tg2bxRbCMnvh4jnxp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12852,"logo_path":"/a2yqtzhDsTCsgccaed7tVCWjkhD.png","name":"Shout!
