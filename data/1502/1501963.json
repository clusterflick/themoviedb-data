This ambitious, innovative work features all new compositions.  Cycles explores the ever-changing rhythms of the natural world. The rising and setting of the sun. The rise and fall of the tides. The waxing and waning of the moon. To do this, Kodo challenged itself with a new approach: composing music based on spatial and mathematical concepts. The performers' souls resonate within these intriguing soundscapes, producing reverberations like never before.
