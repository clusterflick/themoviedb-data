Trapped between social pressures and impossible expectations, Roman embodies a generation burdened by anxiety, frustration, and disillusionment. But his battle runs deeper: he lives with schizophrenia, and in key moments, he sees his deceased brother, blurring the line between what’s real and what’s imagined. Through mental landscapes that distort the boundaries of reality and perception, the film raises powerful questions about mental health, structural injustice, and the urgent need for empathy. ROMAN offers no easy answers—only an honest and raw look into a mind trying to survive in a world that rarely stops to understand. An intimate, thought-provoking, and visually striking experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":1000,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tagline: In a world that demands clarity, his mind tells a different story.","title":"Roman","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
