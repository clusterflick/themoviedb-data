During her political career, she was a tireless champion of women, minorities, and the poor. She fought for education and wage reform, and touted herself as “the people’s politician.” After her retirement from Congress in 1983, Chisholm lived for several years in Williamsville, New York with her husband, Buffalo native and fellow former New York State Assemblymember Arthur Hardwick.  The statue was commissioned using state funding secured by Senator Ryan to honor Chisholm’s legacy and convey that women – particularly Black women – are capable of anything. It was designed by Buffalo artist Julia Bottoms and cast in bronze by Gareth Lichty.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Seat at the Table - The Making of Buffalo's Shirley Chisholm Statue","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Senator Sean Ryan","original_name":"Senator Sean Ryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6855973359c2f43fbdac65b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Bottoms","original_name":"Julia Bottoms","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6855973bb78618966ee17dca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Congressman Timothy Kennedy","original_name":"Congressman Timothy Kennedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6855978b26b8ebce670133f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Barbara Seals-Nevergold","original_name":"Dr. Barbara Seals-Nevergold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68559798483b742f2c8984ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1713466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Chisholm","original_name":"Shirley Chisholm","popularity":0.2907,"profile_path":"/e2XUbHLZsLXMJyQYkBmoyRCxomd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"685597a2546216babbac65b4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517692,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Quentin Jarzynski","original_name":"Quentin Jarzynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685597c5c065b2a0fb7753c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517692,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Quentin Jarzynski","original_name":"Quentin Jarzynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685597d22daffe258a0415b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Seat at the Table - The Making of Buffalo's Shirley Chisholm Statue","key":"_SE3p48R-ow","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-02T17:47:41.000Z","id":"6855980c26b8ebce67013400"}]}}}
