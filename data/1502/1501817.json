After the low-budget trauma of Escape 2 Swindon, Alex, Jamie, and James are hurled into a collapsing multiverse of forgotten content, rogue IPs, and increasingly fractured podcast dynamics. Guided by a nihilist argy and haunted by internal demons, the Jarcast must reckon with their legacy, their friendship, and the terrifying power of group think.  Old allies return. New threats emerge. The takes are worse than ever.  Reality might not survive â€” but maybe... the cast will.","popularity":0.1357,"poster_path":"/23uD6UMdOC9E3wW4z0ttuhzFksp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sponge Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2099-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"They saved the chicken jockey.
