The show begins with a plaintext \"memorial\" to the \"late\" John Cleese. It then cuts to a fairytale starring the troupe (\"The Princess with the Wooden Teeth\" from Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus), which then cuts to a poolside interview of a cranky, senile old man (Cleese) by Dayna Devon, a reporter. The supposedly 96-year-old Cleese usually answers her questions in the raunchiest manner possible, culminating in his \"death\" (by heart attack, apparently) at the end of the show.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pPGPiERYo5bSCMuyzuUwWpAK23r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monty Python's Flying Circus—John Cleese's Personal Best","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cleese","original_name":"John Cleese","popularity":2.3323,"profile_path":"/yonuTnGcc3q9A1w5P7N3dDRdPSh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Various Characters","credit_id":"6854c102033eff2ceb29e428","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Idle","original_name":"Eric Idle","popularity":1.3881,"profile_path":"/1Vj7Lvrl8OHby7AeOK1Z07JyeMp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Various Characters","credit_id":"6854c11ae9bebe120d955d96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Gilliam","original_name":"Terry Gilliam","popularity":2.4062,"profile_path":"/7qBkaXxANmnb6hqQCBc4iWqXEL6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Various Characters","credit_id":"6854c1268c0150029e29e4b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Palin","original_name":"Michael Palin","popularity":1.4126,"profile_path":"/7qCp6M2NxMWpUmO2t6IqHGNlBjz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Various Characters","credit_id":"6854c13cf1db2209e10cf5c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Jones","original_name":"Terry Jones","popularity":1.0841,"profile_path":"/keJpqxK8gykrrK2W6yeSeDUbYDK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Various Characters","credit_id":"6854c14a825fabcc6f955cf9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Chapman","original_name":"Graham Chapman","popularity":1.0828,"profile_path":"/qmTXDGNxuuwQ4IGNHwxmCdjuTGk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Various Characters","credit_id":"6854c17a31c4154520cc2572","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pPGPiERYo5bSCMuyzuUwWpAK23r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
