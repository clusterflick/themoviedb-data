Her father, a world-renowned author whose words once defined a generation’s understanding of love, and her mother, a sought-after creative director celebrated for capturing the essence of intimacy through her lens, built a life shaped by passion, artistry, and devotion until the foundation began to crack. As their love story fades from the idealized lens of the public into the stark reality of divorce, Simone begins to question whether love is ever as real as it seems. Now in her final year of college, she stands at the crossroads between the creative world she was born into and the growing disillusionment in her heart. Just as she prepares to give up on the idea of love altogether, she meets Myles, a charismatic transfer athlete with unexpected emotional depth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Jonesing: When Love Is a Habit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamaj Nixon-Myers","original_name":"Kamaj Nixon-Myers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Myles Cole","credit_id":"68562baa9d5d43d563fc7335","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaria Charaman","original_name":"Aaria Charaman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Simone Love","credit_id":"68562bb3e0e9aed792a78f69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khalil Kain","original_name":"Khalil Kain","popularity":0.9175,"profile_path":"/3uLKdggLtnST0oTceEKzl4yAd5t.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Attorney Fox","credit_id":"68562bbe013ad99bfa7e7668","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malik Yoba","original_name":"Malik Yoba","popularity":1.1584,"profile_path":"/nq7sNTe2I6xAoN2JiCrbDaZq5kn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Uncle Eric","credit_id":"68562bc7d5ee799d7ba45ff8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sajda Waith","original_name":"Sajda Waith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Layla Henderson","credit_id":"68562bd3a0793810f3ec56f3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena B.
