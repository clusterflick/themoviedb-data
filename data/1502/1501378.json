Set in a beloved East Village restaurant during the early days of reopening after the pandemic, it stars Victor Rasuk, Danny Hoch, and the real people who made the place a sanctuary for community. At once funny and poignant, the film is a meditation on grief, resilience, and the small rituals—both absurd and sacred—that keep us connected. It’s rich with character, brimming with the kind of imperfect charm only real life can deliver. Il Posto is about a neighborhood, a family—chosen and otherwise—and the quiet beauty of coming together after isolation. Made on a modest budget with a lot of heart, it captures a moment in time when the simple act of gathering felt nothing short of holy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":265835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Do Nothings LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It takes a Village.","title":"Sunday at Il Posto Accanto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Rasuk","original_name":"Victor Rasuk","popularity":0.7485,"profile_path":"/1vh2Yzp9bhmaxLfpNCrO7DVoURd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sixto","credit_id":"68557a46bf42c8820da04b87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Hoch","original_name":"Danny Hoch","popularity":0.9543,"profile_path":"/mbV5Ks15q0OMByJlvaerHt7XKFM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Danny","credit_id":"68557a592b9e1687e0a04bfa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Marte","original_name":"Judy Marte","popularity":0.3338,"profile_path":"/2ssKTCLuB1JxUVYw0nW0T3XqLtA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roxanna","credit_id":"68557a86b5a35a410529e5a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Pena","original_name":"Julio Pena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Julio","credit_id":"68557cd08f94550384cc2851","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032175,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seth Zvi Rosenfeld","original_name":"Seth Zvi Rosenfeld","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/4lMBwFooOvNWHOe3ogfEhn2RL5y.jpg","credit_id":"68557aa82d05671be47cb79f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032175,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seth Zvi Rosenfeld","original_name":"Seth Zvi Rosenfeld","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/4lMBwFooOvNWHOe3ogfEhn2RL5y.jpg","credit_id":"68557abc0d89251fb3550ce5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15017510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":5890,"name":"community"},{"id":10616,"name":"urban"},{"id":190464,"name":"downtown"},{"id":217452,"name":"buddy film"},{"id":255632,"name":"latino"},{"id":263237,"name":"covid-19"},{"id":280027,"name":"food culture"},{"id":293631,"name":"east village"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sunday at Il Posto Accanto - Trailer","key":"QA9nsNV40Jo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-06T17:12:15.000Z","id":"68557d60e44941f4d2a04bd5"}]}}}
