Ten strangers are brought together under the tutelage of John Smith, a mysterious and morally questionable leader. The group of social misfits and restless searchers have one thing in common: they are out of step with their surroundings and desperate for change. With thrumming unease, the class sinks deeper into their lessons as the process demands increasing devotion. When the line between real life and imagination begins to blur, the group's deepest fears and desires are laid bare. Exploring the tension between who we are and how we present and takes us through an unsettling American journey.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41077,"logo_path":"/1ZXsGaFPgrgS6ZZGS37AqD5uU12.png","name":"A24","origin_country":"US"},{"id":123620,"logo_path":"/ePRhZ3yb09Ya6WMzCCBYopwIYbE.png","name":"Square Peg","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acting Class","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquin Phoenix","original_name":"Joaquin Phoenix","popularity":2.7196,"profile_path":"/u38k3hQBDwNX0VA22aQceDp9Iyv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Smith","credit_id":"68558156f1db2209e10cf846","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Stone","original_name":"Emma Stone","popularity":5.8257,"profile_path":"/cZ8a3QvAnj2cgcgVL6g4XaqPzpL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6855815e19e9ba0db0550a27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":984629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Abbott","original_name":"Christopher Abbott","popularity":1.3923,"profile_path":"/qWmlTycQb3yXaGhxPb6LCyaDjqh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"685581653c8ca5430f5509d9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Aster","original_name":"Ari Aster","popularity":2.5756,"profile_path":"/7ycICw9yVpk6bzTKLRiPd9eSfHA.jpg","credit_id":"6855817690d7d964920cf827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Aster","original_name":"Ari Aster","popularity":2.5756,"profile_path":"/7ycICw9yVpk6bzTKLRiPd9eSfHA.jpg","credit_id":"6855817f15cdcf9b6d550bce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lars Knudsen","original_name":"Lars Knudsen","popularity":0.4209,"profile_path":"/y4ZPOAn2oe2KsszWkMGJeahONlU.jpg","credit_id":"6855819de140d525c5a233c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5517577,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Drnaso","original_name":"Nick Drnaso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685581bbf2a700a86dfc0c31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
