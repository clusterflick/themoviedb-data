The subsequent photo book, “Life in Philly”, is filled with raw and vivid images, capturing the atmosphere and the culture of the predominantly African American neighborhood of downtown Philadelphia in the late 80s. This film looks back on those days, bringing Myron to remembrance as Mao and his surviving family try to find the missing pieces.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3b2xScdyGDUpxLZTyyAQW1DhkvB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A black soldier's memoirs told through the photographs of Mao Ishikawa","title":"OKINAWA PHILADELPHIA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5516558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mao Ishikawa","original_name":"Mao Ishikawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6854d8bd248d4292e30cf610","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5516599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"QUAN CARR","original_name":"QUAN CARR","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6854d8d32531fe187f84e30b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5516601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MICHELLE CARR","original_name":"MICHELLE CARR","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6854d8e01426ce9b110cf545","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2818811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Sunairi","original_name":"Hiroshi Sunairi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6854d8f7cf3b5a3ccb1c1169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34265256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4t8Lx4MeeGgFv2AC4JmhqF8O3vr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9URCBZVn8RJ0TKt7m1dWVWr5W2k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxZVcO6XR91vxlP6S6vYQ8IUep.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2064,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3b2xScdyGDUpxLZTyyAQW1DhkvB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1460}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":1003,"name":"photographer"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":8676,"name":"okinawa"},{"id":163132,"name":"photographic memory"},{"id":231501,"name":"female photographer"},{"id":253063,"name":"black soldier"},{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"},{"id":345747,"name":"biographical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"World Premiere at 1st Cinema at Sea - Okinawa Pan-Pacific International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OKINAWA PHILADELPHIA | OK3 | Official Trailer","key":"MNW191gzCBg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-18T02:26:06.000Z","id":"6854d880179d1704bf5d8c28"}]}}}
