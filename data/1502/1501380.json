However, looks can be deceiving: they are actually dating! Afraid to lose the peace of their professional lives, Yui and Masugu play up their discord even more to ensure nobody discovers their secret.

Keeping up the pretense is not easy, but with each new day, their relationship only grows stronger.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4WnEjRQ84iAHfktE4DB96aRd7Fa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anime , Romance","title":"I Have a Crush at Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1036,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WnEjRQ84iAHfktE4DB96aRd7Fa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":735}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
