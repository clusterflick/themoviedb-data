At first, Annie's nerves and Berit's cool aloofness threaten to ruin their day before night falls. But their growing attraction, and the uniqueness of their chosen meet-cute, start to bring them together. That is, until Berit notices that something's up with Annie beyond first date jitters. Berit starts to lose time, and lose their head - not just to Annie's charms but to something deeper, darker, and more sinister out there in the woods. At least, Berit thinks the danger is out there in the woods...which drives them into Annie's tent, her arms, and a fate it's too late to escape from. When morning comes, a different Berit emerges.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zrj8UNHhgDhEOHyCgV1yAGLY4Fw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idle/Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Heuzé","original_name":"Elena Heuzé","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68562424dffc3a8814ec5685","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charly Dannis","original_name":"Charly Dannis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6856242e1299614955fc7283","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Jamison","original_name":"Spencer Jamison","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68562437ec258695d3fc7240","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaitlin Fontana","original_name":"Kaitlin Fontana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685623f9013ad99bfa7e764e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5518357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaitlin Fontana","original_name":"Kaitlin Fontana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6856240047b588c909492c9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33626526","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zrj8UNHhgDhEOHyCgV1yAGLY4Fw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
