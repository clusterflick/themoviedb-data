The two have always been on bad terms; their contrasting views and personalities only lead to endless fighting. However, everything changes when Saito's grandfather and Akane's grandmother arrange a sudden meeting and insist that the two get married!  Walking down the aisle is the last thing Saito and Akane want, but they are quickly coerced into accepting the ridiculous plan and soon move into a shared house as husband and wife. Although Saito and Akane despise each other, navigating life together under the same roof may just turn their bitter hatred into everlasting love.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/b9fmMMvfXJfB4zicLVwNxJa8A54.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anime , Romance , Harem","title":"I'm Getting Married to a Girl I Hate in My Class","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9fmMMvfXJfB4zicLVwNxJa8A54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
