Built around Campbell’s spoken-word poem, the film reflects on the experience of taking a break from a close friendship, capturing both heartbreak and hope. Visually, it uses layered drawn text that builds to a chaotic crescendo before dissolving—mirroring the rise and fall of intense emotional connections. Celebrating queer joy and vulnerability, the film embraces public expressions of love and self-acceptance. Deeply personal yet widely relatable, One Day has resonated with audiences as a moving tribute to compassion, resilience, and queer visibility.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gJ4cpYnm9Qbe1I1vMxbKPGyleJE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2753144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Campbell","original_name":"Lee Campbell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68563458da404e03177e7661","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gJ4cpYnm9Qbe1I1vMxbKPGyleJE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
