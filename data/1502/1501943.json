With his wry wit and sharp observations, he will share his thoughts on both today's and yesterday's Denmark.  The show asks the questions: Who are we? Where do we want to go? And who do we think we are?  With his unique attention to detail, Jan invites the audience on a journey through the familiar - with a completely new and hilarious angle.  Jan Elhøj steps away from the quirky characters to focus on the good story for a laugh. The language flowers are carefully harvested and ready to be shared from the stage in 2025, where Jan promises pure comedy - the Jan way.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Jan Elhøj: Ser man det","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1852302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Elhøj Nielsen","original_name":"Jan Elhøj","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/vUnNZ7PZyDtBm8wMM3j9WUCoX5J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68570facb73b7da0d9fc75f1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/ouQP4fTpO55XDx2gqYAhcAH54VN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"Bremen Teater, København","release_date":"2025-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
