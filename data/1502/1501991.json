Also covered in the film is background on the MiG-21, including details about the plane used (decommissioned tail number 8971) and how MiGs’ presence in the Angolan Civil War ultimately hastened the end of white rule in South Africa. See historical footage and personal interviews, including the Polish pilot who flew tail number 8971 in the 1980s, a South African Border War pilot and the team of artists and craftspeople in Southern Africa and the United States who took on the huge task of covering the aircraft in tens of millions of glass beads.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/l9aZC6H25z1BIyZ1SR8nxhEmTgZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2025-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"It has a presence\"","title":"The MiG-21 Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":88970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Ziman","original_name":"Ralph Ziman","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"68574186fe4de0d2cd398bb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5519768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Bonamy","original_name":"Nick Bonamy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"685741d4bbd92aa58aa7a2fb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5023502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Duran-Lemos","original_name":"Paul Duran-Lemos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685741b6c8b38e0de003683f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/giQuBnEuOQSzKxJ0GZqPnWxi3Kp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l9aZC6H25z1BIyZ1SR8nxhEmTgZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
