As the seasons go by we share the lives of teenagers who for two years commit themselves totally to the fulfilment of their dream: that of becoming a fully-fledged member of the KODO troupe. The only one of its kind in the world, this is a school that teaches not just an art form, but an entire way of life. The artistic director of the KODO ensemble is Tamasaburo Bando, the famous kabuki actor/dancer and Living National Treasure.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8zgh2Zbilk8AndcWZZ635BaKbUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109153,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Classiques","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kodō: The Heartbeat of the Drum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5519077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kodō Drummers","original_name":"Kodō Drummers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pL95qWZljPtGAgyjmo5Hnrn5bmW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"6857150f4695d4563a03679f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamasaburō Bandō V","original_name":"五代目 坂東玉三郎","popularity":0.3457,"profile_path":"/b3pBSOMPM6slp8n8vMNhnFrsYQH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6857166c302b7c0eb0ded70d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5519535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Kent","original_name":"Don Kent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68571599013ad99bfa7e7933","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29441631","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zgh2Zbilk8AndcWZZ635BaKbUU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":759}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kodo | The Hearbeat of the Drum (DVD trailer)","key":"3Wv3OKf-_xQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2014-02-07T12:11:34.000Z","id":"685715acdb8828dbc10367b5"}]}}}
