As the night unfolds, an unexpected moment shifts the emotional balance of the group, leaving one of them silently confronting an experience he does not fully understand.  Al Día Siguiente (The Next Day) explores the fragile boundaries between friendship, masculinity, and unspoken harm. Set in the aftermath rather than the event itself, the film focuses on what lingers once the celebration ends — the doubt, the confusion, and the isolation that follow when pain is difficult to name.  Through restrained storytelling and intimate performances, the film examines how silence can both protect and imprison, and what it means to face the day after everything has changed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/67ePgosGlQlIMK55tnouAnbSk9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Look Through My Eyes Films","origin_country":""},{"id":211224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pasto en Rollo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Nothing was ever the same","title":"The Next Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Next Day","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4934636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrés Revo","original_name":"Andrés Revo","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/f6uGd7mMUntVeohV7s9jX5LXdhG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Santi","credit_id":"698e61d5a68ad2e01a0c2171","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio \"Chos\" Rioseco","original_name":"Emilio \"Chos\" Rioseco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jorge","credit_id":"698e61e52394f3d5060c2159","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3400640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Íker Sánchez Solano","original_name":"Íker Sánchez Solano","popularity":1.1004,"profile_path":"/eHvL807cehcshUoxwJMSCod8IjR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alvaro","credit_id":"698e61efcd73e9a83f83e86f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6003914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha del Hoyo","original_name":"Martha del Hoyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sofía","credit_id":"698e6206c43ca961ea0c215f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3578808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanesa Burciaga","original_name":"Vanesa Burciaga","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/yO3bYfNUGbfJB0iZwbmhF2N7Aq8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cleo","credit_id":"698e6216224527c00483e8c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5028073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Said","original_name":"Alain Said","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eduardo","credit_id":"698e62244d66b68e16b6887b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6003917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulina Yerena","original_name":"Paulina Yerena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mariana","credit_id":"698e623bc43ca961ea0c2170","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4790019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Enrique V.
