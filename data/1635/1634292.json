It was filmed in 2003 to mark the 24th anniversary of filming this documentary about the Burzet pilgrimage. The first part shows the deserted Stations of the Cross filmed a few days before the procession. The second part, with Richard Copans behind the camera, shows me filming the procession on Good Friday. The final part is my own footage, only a fragment of which was chosen for inclusion in my film 24 Passions .
