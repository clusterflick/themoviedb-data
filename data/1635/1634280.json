His vital functions declining, the man hallucinates that he is becoming one of the glaciers, which he calls “crystal beings.” The heroic stance gives way to wonder. A meditation on annihilation — both our individual demise and that of the crystal beings — Supersymmetry frames climate change within a deconstruction of the tropes of Western conquest.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supersymmetry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6003479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Iris","original_name":"Denise Iris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698e3442ed866f84ef37bdbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1118,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/63Rx64Cn4gR7ZLwsxRKCViqjfdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1988},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1516,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/po1ZdTL3AEadPcyPhVXRGIWGIei.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2695}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
