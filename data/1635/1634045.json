The narrative centres on the dynamic between the group and a chicken flapping around in the corner of the room holding plain paper; inevitably the film shows in a comedic manner how the production studio 'Blanc' came up with their name.  Rather than focusing on action, the film leans on dialogue and tone: the “pitch” becomes a character study about aspiration, validation, and the awkward power imbalance between someone trying to make something meaningful and a wildcard... something that everyone disregards but could actually be the most important thing in the room.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oNCuN84iu3x2mlz5tCct4oRffux.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289070,"logo_path":null,"name":"blanc
