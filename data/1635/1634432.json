She is isolated in a house, remembering and fantasizing about such events. The source of her discomfort surrounds her, but in an apparent state of tranquility and peace. The physical and visual contact with the source of her traumas and fears, the Water Element, triggers a re-living of those moments when she almost drowned. Her partner Alex arrives on the scene, she intends to confront her with her irrational state of mind, and tries to make her react and leave this apparent limbo of continuous repetitions of the moments when she was submerged in the water... There will be unpredictable and unexpected consequences. What is true? Are her memories real? Is she really being threatened? Is Julia still at the bottom of the ocean?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drink!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851197,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Serena Grace","original_name":"Serena Grace","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"698e9702c9445644b82f3061","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6004274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ânia Bonança","original_name":"Ânia Bonança","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"698e9724cc357cd62d591361","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6004217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Inácio","original_name":"Tiago Inácio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698e9740d6aa5cf7f5109c86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6004217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Inácio","original_name":"Tiago Inácio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698e9756f147e081108f4f80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6004217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Inácio","original_name":"Tiago Inácio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698e976e15c0b534a1b6894f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827762,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Basil Al-Safar","original_name":"Basil Al-Safar","popularity":0.2596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698e97d26910d10833109d7d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1951116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
