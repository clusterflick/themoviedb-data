It follows Vishal Rawlley, an educator, as he opens the horizon of learning from a finite classroom to the entire world itself. He believes, connecting with nature stimulates all faculties of the human mind; thus, learning happens best in such an ambience. By taking children outdoors, into the wild, Rawlley encourages them to discover real wisdom. The film shows how these students learn to see nature, not as a resource to be exploited but as their alma mater. The documentary invites everyone to reimagine knowledge and learning through a different perspective, one rooted in nature itself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naturally Educated","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39299346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
