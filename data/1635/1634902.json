Owner Leo Goldberg stages a glamorous on-board show and private auction as the train travels from Vienna to Prague via Budapest, selling the Majestic to the highest bidder. But the train is more than a luxury relic: it is a controlled, mobile platform with secure compartments, limited exits, and near-total anonymity. That makes it irresistible to intelligence agencies. A Russian agent under deep cover, MI6 operatives posing as newlyweds, Chinese agents secretly wiring the train for surveillance, and a former special forces officer traveling with his daughter all converge on board. Behind champagne and polite conversation, a covert war unfolds. As the train speeds through the night, the stakes rise, trust erodes, and escape routes disappear.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jvAIhDbu1ER5UwB0YBs90niHAo6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236935,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westside Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The highest bidder sets the rules","title":"The Train","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mădălina Bellariu Ion","original_name":"Mădălina Bellariu Ion","popularity":0.3671,"profile_path":"/8M8HNOixq1S8YpJUytlIYw72F66.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Natalie Krug","credit_id":"698f60c5e2e0b1ae6d0c2763","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4897709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Dewall","original_name":"Dennis Dewall","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Major Alex Stirling","credit_id":"698f60d5cd73e9a83f83ef5f","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39284988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jvAIhDbu1ER5UwB0YBs90niHAo6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2026-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2026-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
