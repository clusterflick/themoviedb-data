Including short pieces available to watch on YouTube, the work consists of a series of 14 short episodes, each only a few minutes long, chronicling the period from the outbreak of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the beginning of the Iraq War.  It was produced and released before many of the films criticizing the Iraq War, including Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11.  It is significant that the film was released on DVD in 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monarch Sangen-Jaya 410","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6005310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryo Nishiyama","original_name":"Ryo Nishiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698f61642394f3d5060c251b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
