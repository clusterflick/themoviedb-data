The film centers on Srabon, a soul weary of the world’s \"poison,\" who attempts to bridge her internal isolation by writing a letter to herself. Through a haunting monologue, she confronts the words she has never dared to speak and the fear that has kept her silenced. As she watches pigeons soar above—messengers of a forgotten past—Srabon grapples with an existential exhaustion that threatens to consume her. Abalipi is a poetic, visual meditation on the edge of endurance, where the act of writing becomes a final attempt to find a reflection that isn't broken.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/t3ikIgpmyLigDiDzjaKmAtP0FWi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drishya Parampara","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abalipi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":5219478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","original_name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zIXIiycTqC7MuoMjHhr6Pc6BWqG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Srabon","credit_id":"698e25cd0beb4bdf6349659e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":5219478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","original_name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zIXIiycTqC7MuoMjHhr6Pc6BWqG.jpg","credit_id":"698e25ed559a43e28c37bce5","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":5219478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","original_name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zIXIiycTqC7MuoMjHhr6Pc6BWqG.jpg","credit_id":"698e25f96dd73242034965b4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":5219478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","original_name":"Sraboni Ashrafi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zIXIiycTqC7MuoMjHhr6Pc6BWqG.jpg","credit_id":"698e26081562b6e4517a0f20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3295482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudra Kawser","original_name":"Rudra Kawser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vwnKe6pkJWy9LCMVPMr6AlgWFln.jpg","credit_id":"698e261853620006291d26d6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3295482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudra Kawser","original_name":"Rudra Kawser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vwnKe6pkJWy9LCMVPMr6AlgWFln.jpg","credit_id":"698e2621088a97f6d409f309","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t3ikIgpmyLigDiDzjaKmAtP0FWi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
