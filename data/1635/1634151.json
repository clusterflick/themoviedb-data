The life led by these 3 men is meagre, having access neither to electricity nor employment that brings regular income. Farming is very arduous, as supply of water is scarce. The gharat becomes a site, which each character wants to own and sometimes disown, in the quest for a better life. The story documents the 3 men’s personal hopes, anxieties and dreams set against the rustic life in the mountains.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Men and a Bulb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pankaj Rishi Kumar","original_name":"Pankaj Rishi Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698e00eb24f7a03e57fb2227","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
