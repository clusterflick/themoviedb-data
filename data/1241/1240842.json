The film is led by filmmaker, Anna Jane (AJ) Edmonds, a bystander, as she takes audiences along the 401 Highway to meet survivors, their advocates and the change makers. These personal conversations detail the luring, grooming, hunting, torturing and exploiting of vulnerable people, most notably children, in our communities. The film exposes the present but invisible dangers of the crime; the places that young people are lured and groomed as well as how those who survive are then further exploited during the fight for justice. Though focused on a Canada perspective, the film mirrors global survivor commentary.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Highway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482446,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Jane Edmonds","original_name":"Anna Jane Edmonds","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0f9655cd16e01639dfb6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31122711","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kingston Canadian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
