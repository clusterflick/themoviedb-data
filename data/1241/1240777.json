At 6:31pm, a shot was fired from beyond the border fence into the crowd. The bullet killed Rouzan al-Najjar, 21, a volunteer medic. Two of her fellow medics, Mohammed Shafee and Rami Abo Jazar, were wounded at the same time. The death of al-Najjar, who was widely revered among the protesters, sent shockwaves throughout Palestine. Forensic Architecture was commissioned by the New York Times to undertake spatial analysis of the scene of al-Najjar’s death. By digitally recreating the protest site from video evidence, we used the precise location of the three gunshot victims as a means to derive the trajectory of the bullet, and trace its ‘cone of fire’ back to its origin, a sniper’s berm at the border fence. -FA","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/s2V4jXkRthCNLEBcRErtmodntDa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killing of Rouzan al-Najjar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0daf05cd16e01639de747","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1621,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s2V4jXkRthCNLEBcRErtmodntDa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
