Some saw it as the final hurdle in a 40-year marathon for equality. To others, it undermined an age-old building block of society. This controversial legislation continues to divide the country, and indeed the world, in half. Through interviews with the public as well as experts in various fields, 'C-38: The Search for Marriage' challenges common notions about marriage, sexuality and equality to answer these and other fundamental questions from an equal and fair perspective.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/xX7onSRDy523utqoH31rJSQomzl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Debate on Same-Sex Marriage Is About to Begin...","title":"C-38: The Search for Marriage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murray Billett","original_name":"Murray Billett","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65be71a6931ea100c999cad2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4251377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mishi Donovan","original_name":"Mishi Donovan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65be71adba480201826a6e6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Phair","original_name":"Michael Phair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65be71b6031deb0183ef50e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4516329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Smith","original_name":"Janet Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65be71c4a7e3630184543ced","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Somerville","original_name":"Margaret Somerville","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65be71d59020120162ca9935","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2020129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric B.
