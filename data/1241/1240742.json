A gothic masterpiece of tempestuous passions and dark secrets, Jane Eyre tells the thrilling story of an orphan girl and her journey from a childhood of loneliness and cruelty to a life at Thornfield Hall and an unlikely relationship with the mysterious Mr Rochester. Falling in love, she gradually uncovers a hidden past to the gloomy, forbidding Thornfield Hall, a terrible secret that forces her to make a heart-wrenching choice.  Captivating, brooding and intensely powerful, Jane Eyre is a moving and unforgettable portrayal of one woman’s quest for equality and freedom, and lives as one of the great triumphs of storytelling.","popularity":0.0774,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jane Eyre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsey Short","original_name":"Kelsey Short","popularity":0.1052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jane Eyre","credit_id":"65c0bfad1dbc8801631e3627","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Warwick","original_name":"Ben Warwick","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/p9BVLC5ttvqTMe4ixa0mOZP4lzv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr Edward Rochester / Mr Brocklehurst","credit_id":"65c0bfd99020120162cc8f58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Simson","original_name":"Camilla Simson","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs Fairfax / Aunt Reed / Bertha Mason / Mary Rivers","credit_id":"65c0c032ba480201616bbb9d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla Simson","original_name":"Camilla Simson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Blanche Ingram / Georgianna Reed / Helen Burns / Adele Varens","credit_id":"65c0c04da35c8e0163d637e9","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
