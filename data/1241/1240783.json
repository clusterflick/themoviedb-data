Thousands of migrants and refugees were funneled to a single point on the land border between the two countries, the border fence near Kastanies/Pazarkule, with the promise of an open route to Europe. The Greek government responded by deploying its police and military to the region. It warned migrants not to cross, and suspended its asylum system. On 4 March, violence escalated near the border crossing. Reports emerged of shootings, and casualties. Our analysis shows that it is highly probable that the shots that killed Gulzar and, in all likelihood, wounded the remaining six casualties were fired from the Greek side of the border. -FA","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":"/cQHX7P8zUGvm81GKcuXaz3BikwG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killing of Muhammad Gulzar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0dee55e120001821cba70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cQHX7P8zUGvm81GKcuXaz3BikwG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
