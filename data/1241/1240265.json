Mike and Alice recount their own involvement with this music, and briefly trace its history as we meet their mentors: the late Tommy Jarrell, Lily May Ledford, Roscoe Holcomb, Elizabeth Cotton and many other musicians.  Filmed in 1978 and 1979 in the states of Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Washington and California, the film follows Mike and Alice home, and to folk music festivals where a new generation of musicians are picking up and passing on American traditional music. The filmmaker grew up with this rich and beautiful music and wanted to share it with younger generations who might not be aware of it and its role in American cultural history.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"americana","title":"Homemade American Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Seeger","original_name":"Mike Seeger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"67b2057841ea6104626da88e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120714,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yasha Aginsky","original_name":"Yasha Aginsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/io1wbDusszajYejOgShBD0vOk3l.jpg","credit_id":"67b2053c536958672b9fb2a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HOMEMADE AMERICAN MUSIC","key":"gFi8RO_lwIE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-08T06:26:26.000Z","id":"67b205fd41ea6104626da8e3"}]}}}
