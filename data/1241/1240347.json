She swims over deep canyons, and uses underwater mountain tops like motorway service stations. Blue whales thunder by like juggernauts, and sharks dance a beautiful midnight ballet around her. Pacific means peaceful, but it is clearly not. One minute she is under fire from marlin, the next swimming over a coral reef, with crocodiles as well as sharks.","popularity":0.338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Turtle's Guide to the Pacific","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Quarshie","original_name":"Hugh Quarshie","popularity":0.8408,"profile_path":"/buBmcE8F8BpbL7M8yyxST2exMRP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65bf8998031deb0148ee2fb0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033940","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
