He started boxing at age 12, and by age 18, had over 100 amateur fights.  Starting with his first professional fight, you'll see highlights of all his important fights with opponents such as Archie Moore, Sonny Liston, Oscar Bonavena, Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, George Foreman, Leon Spinks, Larry Holmes, etc.  His fights with Uncle Sam over his conscientious objection to the war and the stripping of his title. His sparring with the press (which he learned to manipulate and use to his advantage) in his many interviews. His religious beliefs that led him to chance his name from Cassius Marcellus Clay to Muhammad Ali.  But no matter what name he was called by, \"Gassius\" Clay or \"Motor Mouth,\" he will always be remembered as a \"CHAMPION\" in and out of the ring.  So sit back and enjoy this one of a kind video.
