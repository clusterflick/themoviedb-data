During the raid, two people were killed: a villager, Yaqub Musa Abu alQi’an, and a policeman, Erez Levi. Israeli officials described the death of Levi as a ‘terror attack’, and suggested that Abu alQi’an was connected to the terror group ISIS. But local residents and activists told a different story: police had fired at Abu alQi’an without provocation. Our work pitted us directly against Israeli politicians and police chiefs, and exposed inconsistencies in the official account of the event, as well as mishandling of evidence after the fact. -FA","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/i0QaGS3J04WCmIwkE946Bocr5NZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Killing in Umm al-Hiran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0ceea031deb0183f322da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i0QaGS3J04WCmIwkE946Bocr5NZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
