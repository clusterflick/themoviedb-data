A prisoner is about to go on a journey. René is to be transported in a prison bus to another town for a court hearing. \"Raumfahrer\" describes the curious procedure of the transfer of a prisoner – or ‘Verschubung’ as it is known in German – from the point of view of the prisoner. It’s a case of constant stop and start in front of closed doors and gates, as well as endless periods of waiting around. As the bus travels through town and country, the world moves past René’s narrow observation slit in cinemascope. Everything seems close enough to touch and yet so very far away.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":220089,"logo_path":null,"name":"HiHead Film (Köln)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raumfahrer","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hajo Schomerus","original_name":"Hajo Schomerus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0f1cd031deb0162f07ae3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415043,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Georg Nonnenmacher","original_name":"Georg Nonnenmacher","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0f1b35cd16e017c9fadb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475880,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anika Simon","original_name":"Anika Simon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0f1db12c604016201e866","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1705093,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rainer Gerlach","original_name":"Rainer Gerlach","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0f1f8fc65380149e9afb3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3413360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
