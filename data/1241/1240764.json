The target of what came to be known as ‘Operation Gideon’ was Óscar Pérez, the leader of a small rebel group acting against the government of President Nicolás Maduro. Nine people were killed, including Pérez and six other members of his group. All but one were found to have injuries consistent with being shot in the head. Two members of the Venezuelan armed forces were also killed. In order to understand the events that took place that day, FA and Bellingcat analysed material recorded by citizens, security forces, and by Pérez himself, as well as official statements, and leaked audio of police communications. -FA","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/rdvbfEUqV2XJ4aV58Gf3bY5GV6Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standoff in El Junquito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2773522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Architecture","original_name":"Forensic Architecture","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0d455ba480201826e9737","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rdvbfEUqV2XJ4aV58Gf3bY5GV6Y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
