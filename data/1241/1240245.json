Nun imparts martial artistry to Lee, who will kill the old enmity when she grows into womanhood. Yan and his half-brother Luk Sun are assigned to capture the survivor. Fong-ping comes under the attack of an assassin dispatched by Sun when Butterfly comes to his help. Recruited to the Yan den, Ying Tin-lung summons the knights-errant of the martial world to the court. Lee infiltrates the congregation and has her eyes fixed upon Sun and strikes him with the Soul-snatching Tai Chi Dart which has mistakenly wounded Fong-ping. Butterfly puts Lee into a drug-induced coma to obtain the antidote to treat Fong-ping. Ying seizes the chance to capture the women. Fong-ping sustains another injury to rescue the hostages. Nun arrives in time and seizes the Lee family heirloom. Lee avenges her parents' death.","popularity":0.3487,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":219942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tai Shing Film
