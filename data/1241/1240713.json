The film material is sourced from fragments of rubble infrastructure dispersed and strewn about as older buildings are demolished and untold histories become erased. This film is an elegiac experimental map of the text and textures of cities in a state of flux.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/iBz68cSRHcDo60wded2XweDZ6YJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"an accumulation of our aftermaths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2672555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Solomon Nagler","original_name":"Solomon Nagler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c0a492fc6538017cedc7bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBz68cSRHcDo60wded2XweDZ6YJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":653}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
