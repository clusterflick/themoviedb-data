From heatwaves in the South to sub-zero storms in the North, from the most beautiful coastlines to majestic and at times intimidating mountain ranges, this journey had it all. I'll forever be grateful for the people I met, the hardships and challenges that pushed me to the limit, the landscapes I could scarcely believe were real, and more than anything, for the incredible feeling of being alive.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bikepacking","title":"Bikepacking Across Europe - Spain to Norway - One Thousand Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
