It seems that Moe was in debt and suffering a nervous breakdown so Larry and Joe took him to the country for rest and relaxation. After a marauding bear ruined the peace and quiet, their cabin became the scene of a shoot-out between the sheriff and an escaped outlaw. The boys captured the bad guy, and the reward would have paid Moe's debts, but the crook escaped and Moe went after Larry and Joe with an ax.","popularity":0.529,"poster_path":"/dE1SsM5lvL3xBWMft725aCw8eVr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Moe suffers a nervous breakdown and travels to the country with Larry and Joe for peace and quiet rest in a cabin.","title":"Guns a Poppin!","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"52fe4bb1c3a36847f820fb0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Besser","original_name":"Joe Besser","popularity":0.2981,"profile_path":"/A2pHRTtPh9CqQlXD5omN0TJ5yhc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"52fe4bb1c3a36847f820fb13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"5cdf8b9ec3a3684b551e0216","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Dent","original_name":"Vernon Dent","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/hIZai6jeEnoomMjlJm2bhHSQ15O.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Judge (archive footage)","credit_id":"62d5ab6c72c13e062fedf659","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Palma","original_name":"Joe Palma","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62d5ab7789d97f004f7f5e76","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elwood Ullman","original_name":"Elwood Ullman","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bb1c3a36847f820fb19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bb1c3a36847f820fb1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack White","original_name":"Jack White","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/p2zXJB3TnIUEyvDAkD5YIZc8EIp.jpg","credit_id":"657c41ceba131b00ad7228a8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34174,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry Freulich","original_name":"Henry Freulich","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c41e3564ec700acd67b42","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13864,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Cary Odell","original_name":"Cary Odell","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657c41f1ea3949011b3cf738","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33368,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Saul A.
