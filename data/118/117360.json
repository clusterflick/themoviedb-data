But he takes an opportunity to observe the upper class of 1900 Paris - Monsieur Boniface with a domineering wife, and the next-door neglectful husband Henri with a beautiful but ignored wife, Marcelle. Henri traces architectural anomalies (most ghost sounds are drains) and plans a night at the Hotel Paradiso, but this hotel is the assignation spot of Marcelle and Boniface. One wife, two husbands, a nephew, and the perky Boniface maid, all at this 'by the hour' hotel and consummation of the affair is, to say the least, severely compromised (not the least by a police raid). All of this is under Feydeau's eye, and his play is the 'success fou' of the next season.","popularity":0.9226,"poster_path":"/fdq2lqPhQV5FJlSR4QsUhOWpyQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5579,"logo_path":"/p3vXYhkpbws0QrdSAwI98ONX7Po.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer British
