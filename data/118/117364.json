Finding Home follows four girls striving to pull themselves out of the margins by attending a one-of-kind rehabilitation center in uptown Tehran. Forget about the Iran that you've seen before. With a virtually invisible camera, the girls of Finding Home take us on a never-before-seen tour of the underclass of Iran with their brave and defiant stories: Samira struggles to overcome forced drug addiction; Mitra harnesses abandonment into her creative writing; Sussan teeters on a dangerous ledge after years of sexual abuse; and Nazila burgeons out of her hatred with her blazing rap music.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":173307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fictionville Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2009-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Glass House","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065394,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Melissa Hibbard","original_name":"Melissa Hibbard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62559edee54d5d128d322a01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Bergeaud","original_name":"David Bergeaud","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62559f20cffeed017da160dc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamid Rahmanian","original_name":"Hamid Rahmanian","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62559ef11b1f3c0f8ea6747a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamid Rahmanian","original_name":"Hamid Rahmanian","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62559f07aaec7100505e5f87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamid Rahmanian","original_name":"Hamid Rahmanian","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bb2c3a36847f82100b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065394,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Melissa Hibbard","original_name":"Melissa Hibbard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bb2c3a36847f82100b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1175285","wikidata_id":"Q7736709","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
