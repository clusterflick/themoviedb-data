At the hospital, his parents agree to an organ transplant and a little girl receives one of his kidneys. She is seven years old and … she is Palestinian.  Yoni (Jonathan) Jesner had come to Israel for two years’ religious studies in a yashiva. Her was a brilliant student, very religious, yet he was open to the world and was always there for others. He wanted to become a doctor, but he died at only 19, in September 2002 – a victim of a bomb attack while he travelled by bus to Tel Aviv. He had still been alive on his arrival at the hospital, but he was soon declared brain-dead. The surgeons asked his parents to consider donating his organs for transplantation. At first, they hesitates, but after consulting with a Rabbi, they accepted.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59363,"logo_path":"/rkARRnarcj9AwpcoOQbgZTV8ayZ.png","name":"Sunset Presse","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Hatred","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064972,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emmanuel Francois","original_name":"Emmanuel Francois","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba8c3a36847f820e347","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064972,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emmanuel Francois","original_name":"Emmanuel Francois","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b4ae9bc3a368297e001d9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arnaud Hamelin","original_name":"Arnaud Hamelin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b4aed092514173640060bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1516513","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
