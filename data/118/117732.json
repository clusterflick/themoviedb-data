This unspoken affinity between them is on the verge of growing into something beyond simple commiseration when Yoav realizes he must decide where his priorities lie, with his military unit or with his personal life. Like others in his group, their excursions into civilian life so often involve consoling widows or parents or children, made all the worse by knowing that they must go back again and face future tragedies in action.","popularity":0.1501,"poster_path":"/o2tbVOH4yu1XbZxVM475yk4KoA5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Repeat Dive","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Repeat Dive","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":25818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mosko Alkalai","original_name":"Mosko Alkalai","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Yohi's father","credit_id":"551d76b1c3a3683a200006bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaharira Harifai","original_name":"Zaharira Harifai","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Yohi's mother","credit_id":"551d76b9c3a3683a1c0006ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelo Miller","original_name":"Angelo Miller","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"551d76c1c3a3683a0a000654","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816468,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Doron Nesher","original_name":"Doron Nesher","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Yoav","credit_id":"6448b58ff2cf2504b8adaf84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liron Nir-Gad","original_name":"לירון נירגד","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/udVJRhzbO9t0GbxCPU65obiAUvW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mira","credit_id":"6448b93c6a222704a0d14dac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ze'ev Shimshoni","original_name":"Ze'ev Shimshoni","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ami","credit_id":"6448bba6f2cf250560adb1e8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1988846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Muggia","original_name":"Dan Muggia","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Amos","credit_id":"6448bc0c49756004e6df2223","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ami Traub","original_name":"Ami Traub","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gidi","credit_id":"6448bc1c0f21c6046e280523","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2661223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yair Rubin","original_name":"Yair Rubin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Yossi","credit_id":"6448bc367f2d4a053b0b1f1e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalia Shimko","original_name":"Dalia Shimko","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Tami","credit_id":"6448bc9b497560048edf2204","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shimon Dotan","original_name":"Shimon Dotan","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551d76a392514137430006b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119299,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniel Schneor","original_name":"Daniel Schneor","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6448c84d2fdec604e4a0de62","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47105,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danny Shick","original_name":"Danny Shick","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6448c85a2fdec60573a0dd7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133290","wikidata_id":"Q7313943","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o48nRaHCAHQvD7tn5ZkKLl63Xcf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1675}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o2tbVOH4yu1XbZxVM475yk4KoA5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Los Angeles","release_date":"1987-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
