Ten years later, Meiselas returns looking for the people who appear in the photographs: where are they now, what do they remember, what do they think of their country and of the revolution? She finds a woman who buried her husband when she was 14; she talks to those who fought the Guarda Nacional - some are disillusioned, some still have the fervor of revolution; she talks to mothers about their sons; she finds a Guarda member who became a Contra. And she offers her own reflections on time and history and on the moment and meaning of a photograph.","popularity":0.1051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pictures from a Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Meiselas","original_name":"Susan Meiselas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4badc3a36847f820f0fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard P.
