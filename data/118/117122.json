This thin, combative woman is already a world-wide famous artist. She defines herself as a \"visual activist\" in order to highlight her commitment to politics, to communicating ideas and to art. Her work includes: provocative nudes (like a female Mapplethorpe); young Zulu couples, dressed in traditional costumes, embracing each other; a homeless socially excluded lesbian couple; a dignified portrait of Victor Mukasa, the gay human rights leader from Uganda; wonderful shots of Zanele with her white partner. Beautiful and poetic pictures which are \"militant\" in nature since they condemn homophobia, poverty, and the public and private conflicts of a country divided between tradition and modernity.","popularity":0.1075,"poster_path":"/9ODLguTcxsPK8Z8CwyKgEE8XEus.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Difficult Love","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zanele Muholi","original_name":"Zanele Muholi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4baac3a36847f820e81f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589200,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Goldsmid","original_name":"Peter Goldsmid","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d05648e925141488ab8209b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12471092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":824,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ODLguTcxsPK8Z8CwyKgEE8XEus.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":264386,"name":"lesbian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Difficult love, difficult truth","key":"z5IZEs_4ZmQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-10-04T10:33:57.000Z","id":"673ebd5c99961e3a1267344e"}]}}}
