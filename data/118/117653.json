When she leaves for a short while, her dog Fifi accidentally drops popcorn kernels in the dough. Mickey and Pluto come over and visit with Minnie and Fifi. When Mickey notices that something is burning, Minnie remembers the cookies, which are popping popcorn out of them. Minnie is upset and lies on her sofa crying. Mickey goes out and buys a large amount of cookies and crackers. He comes back and shows them to her and she is overjoyed.  The short was originally a theatrical advertisement for the National Biscuit Company (now known as Nabisco), where all of the products seen are various Nabisco products (i.e. Ritz Crackers, Oreo Cookies, Fig Newtons, etc.). These would later be edited out and replaced with generic-brands in television broadcasts and home video releases.","popularity":0.2837,"poster_path":"/dDWhiGOZby17vHDGaYrhlx230Ne.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mickey's Surprise Party","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":32,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mickey Mouse","credit_id":"54ba3cd9c3a3684046000f7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcellite Garner","original_name":"Marcellite Garner","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/wnR43U3x7gVV3PM3BAZ7Kr7HQ4h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Minnie Mouse","credit_id":"54ba3cebc3a3686c61005b93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pluto","credit_id":"55be31d2c3a3683921002db9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060535,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walt Kelly","original_name":"Walt Kelly","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ba3cfe92514148f0003382","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143786,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ollie Johnston","original_name":"Ollie Johnston","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/7LShcoYbJg7vfXV2lSjzTlGAGb.jpg","credit_id":"54ba3d10c3a3684046000f86","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamilton Luske","original_name":"Hamilton Luske","popularity":0.4351,"profile_path":"/bEccjwuG6QGc4V0AtA87rexRHYo.jpg","credit_id":"5ac8c45bc3a36834ce03d6fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"679e91ed80082986c8cb526d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0168072","wikidata_id":"Q3212991","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vAh7hGVf9WizCmrswhuwAhGuvx9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dDWhiGOZby17vHDGaYrhlx230Ne.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cbP4Ao8LXKdsgQNO3t7EcbrnyUO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ldSKMEUod3YKrV1hKykANUqcvDf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/aPzB0U6QtPHKYNnZ8y3tscCu8K4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209995,"name":"nabisco"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
