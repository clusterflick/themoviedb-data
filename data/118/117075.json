Now everything is sweetness, what continues is death: the voyage into death – the transfiguration – the images that return, only to disappear from memory, emerge from the recollections in a purifying vortex that take them back to their essence. It’s the gradual breaking down of the image into form and then into colours and then into light and finally it’s the beginning: the vibration that is the matrix of sound of light of life. It’s the cosmos that makes that meat good to eat for a million years.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/sSU186xnXIVMFkIxd5pP6bqn7vb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stricnina","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piero Bargellini","original_name":"Piero Bargellini","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/2RUZTL16k4Adi8nrS89EBEQ2ywZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e4c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1520384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sSU186xnXIVMFkIxd5pP6bqn7vb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival of Independent Avant-Garde Film","release_date":"1973-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
