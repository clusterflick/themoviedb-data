It feeds on a crab. In spring it's time to mate. A male grabs a female; he inserts his third arm in her respiratory cavity. We watch another pair: a larger female is the aggressor here. Mating is repeated over hours and days. The female releases strings of fertilized eggs that hang from the roof of a nest. She guards her spawn for a month, fanning the strings to circulate water for oxygen and cleanliness.","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":"/6gYPgIl7lG8uY59gUgTxmgwygj5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Love Life of an Octopus","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Painlevé","original_name":"Jean Painlevé","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/nPBl1BeNGekK6IxV4Ht6LFUmDxu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bbac3a36847f82116cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geneviève Hamon","original_name":"Geneviève Hamon","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/eruAyqP9u5QT5HUefspTWAHfQP2.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bbac3a36847f82116d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337946,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Henry","original_name":"Pierre Henry","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/injmx8aB9w3zFwdeo29hXn782xk.jpg","credit_id":"5fe6855bf36a32003d639307","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1441320","wikidata_id":"Q72523428","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rM75mMqStOc98gOS4Yz0X6SSuyU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1235,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6gYPgIl7lG8uY59gUgTxmgwygj5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":824},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kS4gilGlcgcrHWPl4kZ0YVAgmN8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j62K4FrHLxJYIKwy4mSkfhNZc6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2771,"name":"octopus"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
