The drama was filmed on the Devon coast near Torquay, not far from where Gosse lived. With a literal belief in the Old Testament, Philip Gosse is opposed to the new theories of Charles Darwin, espoused here by biologist Brackley. Assuming \"the Lord's will\" determines the fate of his ailing son Edmund, Philip Gosse creates a life-threatening situation, even suggesting the illness is God's punishment because of Edmund's desire for a toy ship.","popularity":0.3946,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Adam Stood","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Badel","original_name":"Alan Badel","popularity":0.2848,"profile_path":"/3cRgBUd9ktS8kB6IIdNkU29FgJM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5586e684c3a368273b0057dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Harris","original_name":"Max Harris","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5587ec3d9251416818001543","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Hines","original_name":"Ronald Hines","popularity":0.2412,"profile_path":"/pni7gPlQxJNkl434EyTZpAXEbCY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5587ec449251416b00001f94","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Boht","original_name":"Jean Boht","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/g9njuopM7qIgALSxh2XT8IKzvWU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5587ec4cc3a36827350071aa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Gibson","original_name":"Brian Gibson","popularity":0.1295,"profile_path":"/fJQ5EDCU3oNiQzaqCgCOp719XfX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e4b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dennis Potter","original_name":"Dennis Potter","popularity":0.3684,"profile_path":"/oiymzgh2XvUZVNjqIarbBW1il06.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e4bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075425","wikidata_id":"Q7993155","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
