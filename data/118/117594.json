This animal reproduces by buds, which we watch close up in time-lapse images. In another kind of jellyfish, the buds grow inside then live outside for a few days until being on their own. Another produces eggs, sometimes self-fertilized. Some single eggs become buds with colonies. Another clump gathered at low tide consists of filaments of a colony - plumes with poison ends. In images taking 72 hours, we see filaments grow and produce a feeding organ from which a plume emerges. New jellyfish emerge from buds twice a day at set times to form a new colonies.","popularity":0.1093,"poster_path":"/3PWCYsLTvWlj4ytI4A6xlgP5bGD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Some Jellyfish Are Born","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Comment naissent les méduses","type":"Original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Painlevé","original_name":"Jean Painlevé","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/nPBl1BeNGekK6IxV4Ht6LFUmDxu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bbac3a36847f82116b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geneviève Hamon","original_name":"Geneviève Hamon","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/eruAyqP9u5QT5HUefspTWAHfQP2.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bbac3a36847f82116bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0129836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2qsmYHDLmYlcLzxvPlBTZBPBpg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yZiqGFPk9CMnwElqk7wUAfbqCyk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3PWCYsLTvWlj4ytI4A6xlgP5bGD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
