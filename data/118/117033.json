Was it brilliance? Was it cheating? And how did he do it? \"Press Your Luck's\" host and crew, the family of Michael Larson - the man who walked away with $110,237 in cash and prizes - and Michael's opponents from that fateful day gathered in Hollywood 19 years later to relive the events of that remarkable event in TV history.","popularity":0.6654,"poster_path":"/pNpUsInXKVGVY1KFsxlm1J7UowR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Game Show Network (GSN)","origin_country":""},{"id":55996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Termite Art Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":26554,"logo_path":"/8KCY7SFDapSTQhEVH6jQMaabCmV.png","name":"FremantleMedia","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":28523,"logo_path":"/zzULw9w7d50BHR8fE30PZT3zJ1D.png","name":"Lionsgate Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Press Your Luck Scandal","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Big Bucks The Press Your Luck Scandal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Tomarken","original_name":"Peter Tomarken","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/cFxZyCVghvVSXqPktbbtjeAblU7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ba8c3a36847f820e251","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056991,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wes Dorman","original_name":"Wes Dorman","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bed88b858678009378e9ec","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James P.
