She and her mother consult a pandit, and he advises them to go to India to clear this matter up, as this pertains to her past life. Mr. Thapar will only let Anjali go there after she marries the man of his choice; so Anjali decides to run away. Her father alerts a ruthless CBI Officer Sikander Baksh (Danny Denzongpa), who is soon on her case. Anjali meets with car-thieves, Karan and his uncle (Arya Babbar and Shakti Kapoor respectively), and then begins her journey into a past life, as Nandini, the lover of freedom fighter Abhay (also Arya Babbar), and his subsequent death at the hands of British-aided traitor Tejeshwar Singhal (Ashutosh Rana).","popularity":0.3732,"poster_path":"/cSSnEsprUzdqubPIpN5uV0lA1yF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2002-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ab Ke Baras","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arya Babbar","original_name":"Arya Babbar","popularity":0.215,"profile_path":"/fPnrbaQVKuZKdKDCkwGhnqsGqVS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Karan / Abhay","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e695","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amrita Rao","original_name":"Amrita Rao","popularity":0.4848,"profile_path":"/sqbPQ3lbBCuGP6tLj6QuxnC62j5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anjali Thapar / Nandini","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e699","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashutosh Rana","original_name":"Ashutosh Rana","popularity":1.2236,"profile_path":"/jFlhAoEP3KGEXO3SXCA4YLM2Goc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tejeshwar Singhal","credit_id":"5ed5627a1b157d001e55120a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashish Vidhyarthi","original_name":"Ashish Vidhyarthi","popularity":0.5398,"profile_path":"/iBUUpfHZIfpC5afHrHwcyGTHKQF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rudra Singh","credit_id":"5ed5628c21c4ca0021e3d54f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Denzongpa","original_name":"Danny Denzongpa","popularity":1.4505,"profile_path":"/xDNLtgG8iDXxNRvSDjpuNSNfKvX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"DCP Sikander Baksh","credit_id":"5ed5629cc4f552001fbf094f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajat Bedi","original_name":"Rajat Bedi","popularity":0.2526,"profile_path":"/h6hJw3QLAoJjZBvdxHF2QhTR3PO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rajbir Singhal","credit_id":"5ed562b38ddc34001fd817a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shweta Menon","original_name":"Shweta Menon","popularity":0.302,"profile_path":"/31RBamV8AyHSmkrbp9FGYJCehiP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Chembakam","credit_id":"61e55a8cb7abb5006c4f8c19","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raj Kanwar","original_name":"Raj Kanwar","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e69f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4796904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ravi Rai","original_name":"Ravi Rai","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ca7c856c482fdfaaba242","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86782,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robin Bhatt","original_name":"Robin Bhatt","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ca84992ada985c28cd92d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0321067","wikidata_id":"Q4663011","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3wKW28C4cctnG8zNEEPQFxGbak.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cSSnEsprUzdqubPIpN5uV0lA1yF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
