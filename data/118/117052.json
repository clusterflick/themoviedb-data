The film follows the filmmakers as they travel through eastern Slovakia to interview Warhol's surviving relatives, ethnic-Ruthenians living near the Polish border in Miková, and to visit the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce. The museum is shown to be in a poor state, with the museum director and staff openly soliciting donations from the viewer and giving out the museum's bank account details.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":"/haEaokXKmf3XgfKUcSkt9z6eHkk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absolut Warhola","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanisław Mucha","original_name":"Stanisław Mucha","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba8c3a36847f820e37f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanisław Mucha","original_name":"Stanisław Mucha","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba8c3a36847f820e385","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1830426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Schüle","original_name":"Susanne Schüle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782d3b490f42c32837b196c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291672,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dieter Reifarth","original_name":"Dieter Reifarth","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782d3e390f42c32837b197c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanisław Mucha","original_name":"Stanisław Mucha","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6782d408ee84fa4def7b5053","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0303603","wikidata_id":"Q332364","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/haEaokXKmf3XgfKUcSkt9z6eHkk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
