You just keep rooting for all the love in the air.  Em Pillo Em Pillado is a teenagish love story at first, but shows surprising signs of growing up as it moves on. It begins with Bhadram (Pranitha) and Ram (Tanish) at loggerheads with each other in an excruciatingly school-kiddish way; with the kind of leg-pulling that can only mean love when you put yourself on a Freudian thought plane.","popularity":0.1866,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Em Pillo Em Pellodo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Em Pillo Em Pillado","type":"alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanish Alladi","original_name":"Tanish Alladi","popularity":0.2258,"profile_path":"/xfOUEyaqChfaciqCdIJNVsI8brz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e5e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pranitha Subhash","original_name":"Pranitha Subhash","popularity":0.9558,"profile_path":"/nYTdnt5wHIYHa0hK95ZNwsx2mdd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Actress","credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e5ed","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A S Ravikumar Chowdhary","original_name":"A S Ravikumar Chowdhary","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba9c3a36847f820e5f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1711472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
