Each of these conversations could happen any day, every day â€“ except that the young woman has been raped and murdered, the husband has died in a terrible automobile accident, the employer has perished in a fire, and the novelist has passed away from old age. The four intertwined stories weave a tale that is shocking, humorous, tragic and uplifting, in which secrets are shared, truths are revealed, and each of the eight characters comes to an understanding they could not have gained without the touch of death.","popularity":0.2229,"poster_path":"/4goagfRZ6QhhinwlcVXmPGIispw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unauthorized Films","origin_country":""},{"id":91035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Road Dog Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What would you say?","title":"Deadroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Goaz","original_name":"Harry Goaz","popularity":0.378,"profile_path":"/uITv4Ri24uokr44qFBxnWS7Emzg.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Layton","credit_id":"560b81159251417194004660","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grant James","original_name":"Grant James","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/uWaM5vPDs38KxbtB7JngDBbWwha.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Percy","credit_id":"560b81299251417191004ca8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Sebastian","original_name":"Bill Sebastian","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"560b8135c3a368680e004901","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul T.
