In this production by the distinguished film director, John Schlesinger, with spectacular designs by Maria Bjornson and William Dudley, Offenbach's nightmare world is brought to life. The all-star cast is headed by Placido Domingo as Hoffmann: his three loves are Ileana Cotrubas, Anges Baltsa and Luciana Serra and the manifestations of his rival are sung by Geraint Evans, Robert Lloyd, Siegmund Nimsgern and Nicola Ghiuselev. The score, which includes such favourites as the \"Barcarolle\" and the \"Doll's Song\", is conducted by Georges Pretre.","popularity":0.3921,"poster_path":"/nT3oV9tMxCF78REZuuua3CQjCbR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Contes d'Hoffmann","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Contes d'Hoffmann (1981) Royal Opera","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plácido Domingo","original_name":"Plácido Domingo","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/r0OUJ630b7dllOFBQ4SElP3XnpC.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Hoffmann","credit_id":"5693c3f4c3a3684d010050df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Baltsa","original_name":"Agnes Baltsa","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/kR8T4xiKWVSa6zo4uVppHgH9y6U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giulietta","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lloyd","original_name":"Robert Lloyd","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/39hqwFKidqj2K97pEmRMSjwzrzf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lindorf","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c3b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Cotrubas","original_name":"Ileana Cotrubas","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/seremgRpsF5TSUrGjj8N1zJ7WIV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Antonia","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciana Serra","original_name":"Luciana Serra","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/2dcL7sb75szv1ACdEpNurz06jbe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Olympia","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c43","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraint Evans","original_name":"Geraint Evans","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/vbynaZ02QVw0kG9tLrhrbA6YwpI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Coppélius","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolai Ghiuselev","original_name":"Nicolai Ghiuselev","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/qSCPFrJbT54nqPjMNeznWKzcqh7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miracle","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c4b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwynne Howell","original_name":"Gwynne Howell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/kNEDmHnxnYHa2kJtcS2ktcc4wW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Crespel","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c4f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Powell","original_name":"Claire Powell","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/gBBCkdhac9hRJjimDHfkBY9oQB7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nicklaus/Muse","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c53","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegmund Nimsgern","original_name":"Siegmund Nimsgern","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/eWdN76Rwryq5MQ8tJXS7JMBe0Mk.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dapertutto","credit_id":"52fe4bbcc3a36847f8211c57","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Gelling","original_name":"Philip Gelling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Schlemil","credit_id":"56acc95ec3a3681c3f006b1e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Egerton","original_name":"Francis Egerton","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vnN7GSYSSyzRYzMBppe0aQqxvCn.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Pittichinaccio","credit_id":"56acc9879251410e8f005c07","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1155237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Cannan","original_name":"Phyllis Cannan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Spirit of Antonia's Mother","credit_id":"56acc9c09251417e1100640f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Garrett","original_name":"Eric Garrett","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":28,"character":"Luther","credit_id":"56acc9da9251417e1a005cfb","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226499,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georges Prêtre","original_name":"Georges Prêtre","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/uVP8s0ByZNqJOxxhh3tYNx16T1I.jpg","cast_id":29,"character":"Self -
