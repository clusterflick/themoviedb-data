All you have to do is ask. Such advice is not so straightforward when you can't speak the language. By 1951, Australian postwar migration programmes were geared to receiving large numbers of non-British migrants.  Considerable efforts were made to overcome prejudice on the part of the predominantly British-derived community towards the newcomers.  Double Trouble was an attempt to make the point with humour.  Bob and Stan, two Aussie blokes, are magically transported to the streets of a foreign country, where their inability to communicate gets them into a tight spot. They discover that it's not easy being a foreigner in a strange land. The central message in this film is that Australia needs migrants so Australians should make them feel welcome and offer assistance, not complaints.","popularity":0.1242,"poster_path":"/leri3hKD0II1IKm7XVADp5jYLfq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian National Film Board","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Waters","original_name":"Frank Waters","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"60b5847fc58acd002b2e37f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken McCarron","original_name":"Ken McCarron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"60b5852aa61de10029dc364b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Travers","original_name":"Maurice Travers","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60b5854757d3780042872562","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Miller","original_name":"Rosemary Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"60b58581aafebd0058a3a661","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Farrell","original_name":"Charles Farrell","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"60b58628c740d900424cc088","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324205,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Inman Hunter","original_name":"Inman Hunter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b583d3c740d9002b2777ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoffrey Bell","original_name":"Geoffrey Bell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b5840f7d5504002a4f6eb7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110274,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roland Loewe","original_name":"Roland Loewe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b583bc435011003f837c71","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Robinson","original_name":"Lee Robinson","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b583ad899da20042467422","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110264,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Kennedy","original_name":"Don Kennedy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b583e13e09f300407787ed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2592588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Bagnall","original_name":"Frank Bagnall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b583c6498ef90057e04827","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Mason","original_name":"Richard Mason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645ed245a6725400e3d0e52f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1816511","wikidata_id":"Q5299910","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/leri3hKD0II1IKm7XVADp5jYLfq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
