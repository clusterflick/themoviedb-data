They are despised upon by their stepmother who abuses them, making Tanjong handle all the household chores, and chastises Atan at every opportunity. Despite the maltreatment, Tanjong performs her tasks with diligence and prepares snacks for her brother to sell in the kampong, but she suffers the humiliation of a lecherous crook. Atan is eager to learn after watching a class in session teaching the Jawi alphabet, but is scolded for outsmarting his half-sibling. Tun Setia, a visitor from afar, sympathises with the waif siblings and desires to help them. He is determined to rid the kampong of crooks and pirates, and bring justice against the wicked.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/jczP4ouf4V80K9MPOcIimOzMgEc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sri Tanjung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","title":"Sri Tanjong","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","title":"The Waifs","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1279271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hashimah Yon","original_name":"Hashimah Yon","popularity":0.2411,"profile_path":"/iYCpr3oSNW46htSdFYa5HhUNUP7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60b511787d5504007c3bc429","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Mahmud","original_name":"Ahmad Mahmud","popularity":0.2285,"profile_path":"/5B8nEB8WqjZkpWDYvztigiHvncu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60b51189c740d9002b26e8f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1279259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Normadiah","original_name":"Normadiah","popularity":0.1135,"profile_path":"/AXf84HMWPWCbj6JatXKmdzicvM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60b5119fec0c5800406e5236","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3109868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bat Latiff","original_name":"Bat Latiff","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60b511bb4350110029c1f1df","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dato' Haji Jamil Sulong","original_name":"Dato' Haji Jamil Sulong","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b511d2c740d90079d986bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0278054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jczP4ouf4V80K9MPOcIimOzMgEc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ms","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
