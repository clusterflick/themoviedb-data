The topics: sexual (borderline) experiences, traditional role models and the current understanding of male sexuality. The result is that the interviewees themselves subsequently begin to speak openly and frankly about their own experiences. And to reflect on their sexuality. To which social ideals does the male sex see itself committed, and do \"typical male traditions\" still exist at all today?","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/xwrjcXzIaqASvwKoWcFeAGupZfB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88759,"logo_path":"/9qsw4Bwz8MpiHyoj3fOB7Encen3.png","name":"StickUp Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strong Sex","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Being a Man","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Strong Sex","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Strong Sex","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das starke Geschlecht","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3195644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erkan Cakir","original_name":"Erkan Cakir","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629344341e9225004f6f1398","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Grice","original_name":"Oliver Grice","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62934440f2cf25004f4e41e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3568101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick H端bner","original_name":"Rick H端bner","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/pAu77kHWXXZB3SiVpqCfwtGvoBm.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6293444c1e922500640d6484","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Kreglinger","original_name":"Lionel Kreglinger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62934457df86a834e22a0c96","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Seufert","original_name":"Florian Seufert","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629344651e922500640d64d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivo Stagge","original_name":"Ivo Stagge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6293447076eecf590e19b35c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3568104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javid Wunsch","original_name":"Javid Wunsch","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6293447b5a4690009e49dbaa","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Rothlaender","original_name":"Jonas Rothlaender","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b4ddf762e86f002b3ea651","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Rothlaender","original_name":"Jonas Rothlaender","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b4ddff3e09f3007a051cff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Veiel","original_name":"Andres Veiel","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6293439d76eecf590d326ce9","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1878015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luis Singer","original_name":"Luis Singer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629343c05a4690009e49dac0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2401862,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Dennis Schanz","original_name":"Dennis Schanz","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629343cb76eecf590ca29948","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1886246,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia M.
