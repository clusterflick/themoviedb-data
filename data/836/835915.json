Мамлеев","overview":"Eternal twilight, passing trains, a man's hunched figure walking in the fog, a smiling girl, shadows and silence that are related to each other… Under the infernal sounds-noisy, creaking, howling-there are words that \" rub against each other, giving rise to something shaky, almost nonexistent.\" In the center of the metropolis, people with the\" Cain seal \" look for the forest and the sea to get lost,and there they stay. And death looks for people to look at, and finds them there… In the film by Valentina Antonova and Dmitry Mamulia, the 82-year-old founder of Russian \"metaphysical realism\" Yuri Mamleev plays himself shortly before his own death and as if before our eyes is preparing to move to another world.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incessant Conversation.
