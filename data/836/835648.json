Flickering, nearly rectangular patterns join on the image plane, at first in black-and-white, bringing to mind the sprocket holes in celluloid film and, not least due to the lack of geometric precision, giving the impression of a pre-digital origin. As the soundtrack rattles on in a minimalistic way, the patternâ€™s twitchy dance is submerged in various warm hues such as yellow, pink, light green and light blue, which in a different rhythm and to a more agreeable music could be perceived as the signature of slightly retro psychedelia.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2DRdDA24DPRDk58A0YJb363RIgt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frozen Jumper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Frank","original_name":"Tina Frank","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b5cb65a06645006e7d3445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110390,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Rehberg","original_name":"Peter Rehberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b5cc32abf8e200596b9a7c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2DRdDA24DPRDk58A0YJb363RIgt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1yPdm0DTiN0QxcEexiClPzTu8vl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VIS Vienna Shorts","release_date":"2021-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"25 FPS","release_date":"2021-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FROZEN JUMPER, Trailer","key":"513993114","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-18T19:53:13.000Z","id":"60b5cc13aafebd0058a41d53"}]}}}
