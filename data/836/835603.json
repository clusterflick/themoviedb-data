They fell in love and began to live together. At the beginning of 2021, Zhanybek flew home for a month, and upon his return, he learned that he was banned from entering Russia for two years due to administrative violations - smoking in the wrong place, improper parking and driving with broken headlights. Asya followed her beloved man to Kyrgyzstan to discover an unknown country, about which we hear so often and do not really know anything. The film began as a video for a new song by the band \"Zorkiy\", and became a portrait of two people trying to be free in a very unstable world, shot by the band's lead singer Vasily Zorkiy and cameraman Adeline Dzivaeva.","popularity":0.0993,"poster_path":"/99LVVWzlXLQjkIOn8uygzjokRXg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"До свидания","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3110247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasily Zorky","original_name":"Vasily Zorky","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b5721cefd3c2002a9db2c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110249,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adeline Dzivaeva","original_name":"Adeline Dzivaeva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b57238dbcade0040de210a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/99LVVWzlXLQjkIOn8uygzjokRXg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
