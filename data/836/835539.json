I assume the cinematographer used an Auricon, as the sound was recorded directly on the B&W reversal original. In 1998, he sold me the outtakes, strung together just like you see them.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/7lNB5d68Q141k8OTcb2YGkyn2ej.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Anatomy of Melancholy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian L.
