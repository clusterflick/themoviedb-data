However, they are faced with a reality where their idea is opposed by unfounded fears, corruption and hypocrisy of officials. The film by the Guatemalan director Pablo Rojas Castillo, a graduate of VGIK and the School of Documentary Film and Theater Marina Razbezhkina and Mikhail Ugarov, is not only about the company of dreamers and the rave at the sarcophagus of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but also about the need to recycle the Soviet heritage and the clash of values of different generations.","popularity":0.1901,"poster_path":"/9AvJXCEweZXGpyK3IyKpCxS1rC2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102208,"logo_path":"/m3NGbr5cr4XIF80L7BZzccEUsVl.png","name":"M.
