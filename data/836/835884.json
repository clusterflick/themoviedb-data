Residents of this ex coal mining village now at threat of eviction share their stories of community and family as they look to their future.  ‘Hanging On’ is a docu-drama that combines artistic visuals of residents suspended in mid air, literally hanging onto their homes and audio interviews about the strength of what happens when people come together. It reminds us about the struggles of people who are slipping through the cracks of society and what it means to have a home.","popularity":0.3321,"poster_path":"/njq8gCmbDM9qeTvggGxeBvxvmBr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A docu-drama spotlighting the strength of community in a neighbourhood united when faced with eviction .","title":"Hanging On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2806631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfie Barker","original_name":"Alfie Barker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b69d17c740d900424e417d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111122,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hollie Bryan","original_name":"Hollie Bryan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b69d24a066450041436ae8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1930844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben G.
