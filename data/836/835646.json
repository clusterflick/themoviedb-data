The walls of Boots hold many secrets, and the cantankerous bartender Douglas is there to hide them as best he can. Through Go-Go Motel, you will be taken deeper and deeper into this world. The Eastwood Inn Motel, Room 223 serves as the formidable centerpiece of the story. As run down and horrific as any home away from home could be, this house of ill repute shelters many anguished souls, including some of Boots' low class dancers. The hard life forces them there. It is a prison for the immoral of society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"...Some people don't want to talk about SEX, some people don't want to talk about THE LAUNDRY, I don't want to talk about that room...\"","title":"Go Go Motel","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Bell","original_name":"Dan Bell","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/v6deQtp8RPgutjtUGG7EzZIK0xG.jpg","credit_id":"60b5c3e6dd926a002948190d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0953415","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
