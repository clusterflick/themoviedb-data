The sophisticated score with a libretto by acclaimed theatre director Peter Sellars comes to life thanks to the Berliner Philharmoniker, whose intimate knowledge of Adams’s music stems from the composer himself: He attended the orchestra’s rehearsals. In the role of the Evangelist, Bubeck, Cummings and Medley lead through the narrative. A stunning highlight is Lazarus’s aria, sung by tenor Peter Hoare. But at the heart of the piece are Mary Magdalene and her sister Martha during the last days before Jesus’s death, impressively performed by mezzo-sopranos Kelley O’Connor and Tamara Mumford.","popularity":0.2464,"poster_path":"/ebvLxXda3Si79RtjEOCIIRrmJHu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings","origin_country":""},{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Adams: The Gospel According to the Other Mary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rattle conducts Adams: The Gospel According to the Other Mary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelley O’Connor","original_name":"Kelley O’Connor","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/uS4rgG95xT9ypgcvjKzpa2a5gn1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"60b6bab1c740d90079dbc3b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Mumford","original_name":"Tamara Mumford","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/aUHYvL0yoPmOSzcX3JHF93P3m1B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Martha","credit_id":"60b6bac1899da20042480675","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hoare","original_name":"Peter Hoare","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/aE6z4tLrTXpTFq8gGCk0ZZg3EI3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lazarus","credit_id":"60b6bae85c563400589b5b79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Bubeck","original_name":"Daniel Bubeck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zTUvQYIOf9Ltsv8kqAdwlWvPVlG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Countertenor","credit_id":"6115ab890f0da50080b0fd84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Medley","original_name":"Nathan Medley","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yv2xyR8gvBPJpYHzmQvl9FQmpzB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Countertenor","credit_id":"6115ab69cee48100458935fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Cummings","original_name":"Brian Cummings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xAtOtJSSbd805p3H7sP3BaJHMqz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Countertenor","credit_id":"6115ab4687f3f2005cbd1660","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Adams","original_name":"John Adams","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/jWSg6LhA7ZLv15ipUgVlOH0wh94.jpg","credit_id":"623bb39fd7dcd2008bc8f038","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b6bb35a055ef0057fd73af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rattle","original_name":"Simon Rattle","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/erFlB9B08lVMhEj70bLUpkr28iA.jpg","credit_id":"6115b013f1759c007ec84397","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":976,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ebvLxXda3Si79RtjEOCIIRrmJHu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":337056,"name":"berliner philharmoniker"},{"id":339047,"name":"rundfunkchor berlin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
