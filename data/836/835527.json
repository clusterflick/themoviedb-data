In this video, the filmmaker revisits her place of origin, the small village of Strengelvåg in the Arctic North of Norway. Over a period of two years, she explores through her camera, how the architectures and topographies of that place, that is: the mountains, oceans and built environments, has shaped the filmmaker´s attachment to her childhood place, as well as her thinking. Hunting for insight in and beyond the subjective, she renders her experience through three sets of film techniques, such as camera position, superimposition and algorithm, and tests her relation to place, against the agency of the camera, the agency of an algorithm and the subjectivity of other creatures, such as a fish and a crab.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/6MgnUUJwbRhr6OelFT6XAqzY84P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2021-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3xShapes of Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3110057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabeth Brun","original_name":"Elisabeth Brun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b5465b899da200598cf9fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6MgnUUJwbRhr6OelFT6XAqzY84P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vienna Shorts 2021","release_date":"2021-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"67th International Short Film Festival Oberhausen","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"3xShapes of Home (Trailer)","key":"534086349","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-07T17:32:50.000Z","id":"60b5474c50f7ca0040b116ec"}]}}}
