Roland Holet.  \"This film is in several short sections. Most are set in a single location or 'space'; the editing introduces a temporal element into that space. In the third section, for example, the setting is a European cafe; Chomont cuts between different shots that seem to be adjacent to each other in this single space, but various cues–such as the change in characters' positions–tell us that the shots were taken at different times. Chomont is exploring here a fundamental paradox of cinema: that time and space are interdepent, that one camera can film space in a way that make different parts of it seem simultaneously present, cut this simultaneity is an illusion – the time of the filming and of the strip of film in projection is always moving forward.\" – Fred Camper, The Chicagoan, March, 1978.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space Time Studies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Chomont","original_name":"Tom Chomont","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/reBMZAJIQC5buKki1Nj3LHITDTI.jpg","credit_id":"60b6b7e0a80673006edd8437","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
