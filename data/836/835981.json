The musicians themselves act as accomplices in the filming process here — one of the cameras, for example, is fixed on Shnurov's stomach. Other cameras follow the fans of the band, quite funny and accurately recording their emotions and actions from hugs to fights and transmitting the atmosphere of unbridled fun and off-scale adrenaline, which is famous for \"Leningrad\". Terribly funny, tearfully cute, sometimes scary - the effect of a full-length presence.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Х-Х","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1296420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalya Meshchaninova","original_name":"Наталия Мещанинова","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":"/8Jdkz6zF9o9Pq8iGJT1cmy0iQ2n.jpg","credit_id":"60b6da26498ef90027c241c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
