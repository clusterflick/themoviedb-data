In this city in decline, this young maid, flirtatious and lonely trying to escape his daily life. Legs gathered in a large tail covered with scales, she plunges into the sea and escapes. A secret ritual, until the day she decides to register for the Miss Sirène France contest. For a year, she trains tirelessly, doing pool training, jogging in the early morning on the cliffs.
