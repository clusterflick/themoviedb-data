Two patients are seen, one of whom had to change his job on account of reduced respiratory capacity due to bronchitis. This film uses very evocative footage of polluted city centres and inner city housing, showing widespread burning of fossil fuels in industry and the home, as well as a hospital. The result is smutty deposits over everything. Comparisons are made between Social Class 1, who can afford to live in the clean suburbs and Social Class 5, who fall victim to respiratory disease through constant exposure to pollution.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":134803,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Medical Association","origin_country":""},{"id":134804,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Life Assurance Trust for Health Education","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Takes Your Breath Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Martin","original_name":"Bryan Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ed14ca93dc3130020cb1877","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659248,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mary Catterall","original_name":"Mary Catterall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed14c0b3dc313001fccfee1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659248,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mary Catterall","original_name":"Mary Catterall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed14c2498f1f1001eeccb36","department":"Crew","job":"Medical Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Fensom","original_name":"Ken Fensom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed14c47aaec7100206c3f9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
