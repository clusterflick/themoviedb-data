The film is exploring Crimean life in the post-truth era, when the voice of common people is overlaid by governmental propaganda. 5 heroes express their opinion on the situation in Crimea under the Russian flag, talk about their hopes and fears. Real lives of characters are hidden under the official Russian position, full of enthusiasm, bravado and imperial pride. Moreover, propaganda romanticizes militarism and imperial expansion, making it desirable and «sexy» for Russians. While Crimean «homecoming to Russia» as media call it, is considered as the main Russia's achievement of the century, «home-comers» themselves don't feel that confident about their future.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flag of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pyotr Frontov","original_name":"Pyotr Frontov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0de81528b2e001e672043","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12260474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
