Isolation in Auburn’s migrant community is a huge obstacle, and cultural norms mean that women are often tied to the house or a limited locale. Rosemary, with her larger-than-life spirit and generosity, works tirelessly to draw the women out of their homes and into society. She hosts a lively African Women’s Dinner Dance and takes them on a trip to the Blue Mountains and the NSW South Coast – introducing them to an Australia they’ve never seen before.","popularity":0.4686,"poster_path":"/wD9IReoF9igIQnG7MkdO52IOXS9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bower Bird Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":134820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Racing Pulse Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosemary's Way","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Kariuki","original_name":"Rosemary Kariuki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed1adc16e44bf001d17166d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ros Horin","original_name":"Ros Horin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed1ad9398f1f1001eed40f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ros Horin","original_name":"Ros Horin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed1ad9e1b157d002050c60f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Fiske","original_name":"Pat Fiske","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed328d9e4b5760020302ca5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064328,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Arestides ASE","original_name":"Andrew Arestides ASE","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed328eeaaec71001f6d31d8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190315,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kathryn Milliss","original_name":"Kathryn Milliss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed32903aaec7100216adcb5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2660803,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carolyn Constantine","original_name":"Carolyn Constantine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed32914aaec71001f6d3230","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12747500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i1nKfkhdMMUIMZrId4XtqkMGvgh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1670,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wD9IReoF9igIQnG7MkdO52IOXS9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":972,"name":"refugee"},{"id":5976,"name":"multiculturalism"},{"id":10303,"name":"domestic abuse"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":171473,"name":"women's issues"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Sydney Film Festival On Demand","release_date":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rosemary's Way Official Trailer","key":"420910015","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-21T02:32:53.000Z","id":"5ed1ae7e6e44bf001d171759"}]}}}
