The 1993 ballet brought together onto stage the impishly sensual Brazilian ballroom dance and Corpo’s trademark sophistication. Composer José Miguel Wisnik wrote the soundtrack based on the works of Nazareth, the inventor of the “Brazilian tango.” He explored the concept of melodic mirroring to operate retrograde computer-generated movements that are assembled into crystalline surprising musical constructions, absolutely original contemporary recreations of Nazareth’s music. These pieces are commentaries, quotes, and variations on Nazareth’s music that point to a host of new exciting directions. Grupo Corpo’s remarkable team of creators worked hard to blend the erudite and the popular in this kinetic/visual rendering of Ernesto Naza­reth’s genius.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nazareth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grupo Corpo","original_name":"Grupo Corpo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed0c72e98f1f1001fed02c8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","original_name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0c726aaec7100206b3dfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
