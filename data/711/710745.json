In this land, the paths of an old farmer and a young Navajo boy cross, just prior to a world-changing event. This visual narrative piece features beautiful imagery and composition by Vancouver’s Todd Duym, which won him the award for Best Cinematography in a Short Drama at the Leo Awards in early June. It’s a poetic, silent contemplation of the beautiful landscapes and a memorable day long ago, recalled by the boy, now an old man who knows the implications of what he witnessed that morning. This is a powerful indictment of American military nuclear testing and its effects on Native Americans.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Navajo","iso_639_1":"nv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jörn Threlfall","original_name":"Jörn Threlfall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed3330b1b157d00205212e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jörn Threlfall","original_name":"Jörn Threlfall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed33313e4b5760020303b24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7427930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Encounters Festival","release_date":"2018-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
