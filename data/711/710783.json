Over the next four decades, the Chinese people were caught up in struggles with warlords, foreign invasion and a bitter rivalry between the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalist Party. The film highlights the two figures who came to shape events, Chang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong. First they worked as allies to unite the country and then they fought a bloody civil war that was won by the Communists in 1949.","popularity":0.337,"poster_path":"/wWcunlkmD3LFIoJX3MOaJEcOyN0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambrica Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part One: China in Revolution 1911–1949","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"China: A Century of Revolution — China in Revolution, 1911–1949","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Williams","original_name":"Sue Williams","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62344bea34e1520046192933","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tan Dun","original_name":"Tan Dun","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b687d1a89300671835b3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025271,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Sharp","original_name":"Howard Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b7d73d745415a4137098","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443552,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathryn Dietz","original_name":"Kathryn Dietz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b6bd57530e0066d17884","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1241717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith Vecchione","original_name":"Judith Vecchione","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b69e7fcab300509767c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0293034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pjS4vQVmeaEw5ozRHJ0go7NWZa9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWcunlkmD3LFIoJX3MOaJEcOyN0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/fqU5YZObQuwkr5hNPbPhEzb01xL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"英语","note":"","release_date":"1989-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
