Her Noise gathered international artists who use sound to investigate social relations, inspire action or uncover hidden soundscapes. The exhibition included newly commissioned works by Kim Gordon & Jutta Koether, Hayley Newman, Kaffe Matthews, Christina Kubisch, Emma Hedditch and Marina Rosenfeld. A parallel ambition of the project was to investigate music and sound histories in relation to gender, and the curators set out to create a lasting resource in this area.","popularity":0.279,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Noise - The Making Of","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Gordon","original_name":"Kim Gordon","popularity":0.3585,"profile_path":"/QxhtVBFDKFVn6loMj9a1AqNmUv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed203103dc3130021ca21f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":173096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peaches","original_name":"Peaches","popularity":0.1663,"profile_path":"/tNacwiLUZxFy3DKSHowfNH9p3IT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed203181b157d0020511973","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaffe Matthews","original_name":"Kaffe Matthews","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed2032b3dc3130021ca21fe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Lunch","original_name":"Lydia Lunch","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/xVuLoTxLvqhGplZ3cGqe7ckay5c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed2033d96386400247151bd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diamanda Galás","original_name":"Diamanda Galás","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/jeI7QjZlhaq3oxwkkI08TDgwmK0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed20347aaec7100206d75a6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim O'Rourke","original_name":"Jim O'Rourke","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":"/eF1HcAXQ5YUnagBkLBCoc60D2mA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed20389528b2e001f66ce38","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Hedditch","original_name":"Emma Hedditch","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed203a521c4ca0021dffc2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
