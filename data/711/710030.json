The film begins with a woman in deep space, on a ladder, painting a vertical tube-light on one side of the screen with \"White\" paint. As she works, there is less and less light-the dark reflections of light on the floor disappear and the frame becomes whiter. She paints a second light, continuing to white out the frame, and then she dis-appears, leaving nothing except a few traces of black where the lights have been painted over.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2k9AHRSA9u4eYWmrC5BSNJkxXeN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painting Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Haxton","original_name":"David Haxton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/o4UOTzv5WxfhExqmos7h6q45g1Z.jpg","credit_id":"5ed0672998f1f1001eebd44c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2k9AHRSA9u4eYWmrC5BSNJkxXeN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
