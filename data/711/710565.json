The Mexican army responded by killing hundreds of students in the streets. Employing disruptive montage, Parallax combines images from this original protest in 1968 and those filmed on the 50th anniversary of the student massacre, held October 2, 2018. The film offers a critique of the cyclical nature of political tyranny, while attempting to develop a new audiovisual language that drifts between the political and the poetic.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x8rUAcPxyBfqEUitpqjXjDxBssw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallax","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Los Ingrávidos","original_name":"Los Ingrávidos","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed279ba5c071b001e2f3ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.65,"height":1364,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x8rUAcPxyBfqEUitpqjXjDxBssw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":886}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
