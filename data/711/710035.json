From the left, a performer enters, carrying a bucket of paint. The film is in negative therefore everything light is dark and everything dark is light. The performer begins to draw black lines on what appears to be a white wall. The drawing gradually becomes to be a pyramid seen in perspective. The performer leaves and the drawing is left for contemplation by the viewer. The performer re-enters with a pair of scissors and cuts what appeared to be lines. The lines fall to the floor. The performer then commences to build a new pyramid with new strings stretched back and forth in the space.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AeGEEoIkluLxO8o4CzVt9W3qXgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pyramid Drawings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Haxton","original_name":"David Haxton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/o4UOTzv5WxfhExqmos7h6q45g1Z.jpg","credit_id":"5ed069cae61e6d001dccb945","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AeGEEoIkluLxO8o4CzVt9W3qXgb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
