Robin was nine years old, but he already knew what a prison looked like and the bad a punishment can do. Frida was not yet born when we filmed her mother Angela in 1983. Her sister Malin lived for several years in a foster family. Bosse was 14 years old and in 9th grade when we met him in 1978. He was the only guy in the class who had glasses. Marie received many postcards and letters from her father, but  very rarely met him while she was growing up.","popularity":0.1031,"poster_path":"/yU2HAly4VbuqeVEpIFODrOYCu2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2013-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What happened to the children?","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Alandh","original_name":"Tom Alandh","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/6e7MktN5efHy8X7urECVCbC0dcV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Speakerröst","credit_id":"660c545a0b5fd6017c382716","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Alandh","original_name":"Tom Alandh","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/6e7MktN5efHy8X7urECVCbC0dcV.jpg","credit_id":"5ed389231b157d001f54678b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Alandh","original_name":"Tom Alandh","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/6e7MktN5efHy8X7urECVCbC0dcV.jpg","credit_id":"5ed3892a1b157d001f546798","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1908588,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Björn Henriksson","original_name":"Björn Henriksson","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed3893afea0d7001e88930d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073878,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Heleen Rebel","original_name":"Heleen Rebel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed389461b157d001f5467c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EohtCc3y0eqHFKIvHh6RJhZXlR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":870,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/yU2HAly4VbuqeVEpIFODrOYCu2q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":581},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5IwLPJjsMjfEjMNsT7eZWuTmnPb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"Btl","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"SVT1","release_date":"2013-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
