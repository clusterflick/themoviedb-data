From working and devotion chants, from the memory of the rhythmic baião and from the exuberant and an ever present, entangled, rhythmic points and counterpoints, emerges choreography full of hip swaying and feet stamping. It’s a ravishing statement of maturity and of the expressive teachings, developed throughout many years, by the maker of Missa do Orfanato and Sete ou Oito Peças para um Ballet. The aesthetic of the votive offerings, from country side churches, inspire Fernando Velloso and Paulo Pederneiras in the creation of the 15 meter X 8 meter panels, which provide support for the ballet’s stage setting.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parabelo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grupo Corpo","original_name":"Grupo Corpo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed0c8c7528b2e001f65c41a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","original_name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0c8dd528b2e002068f39e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
