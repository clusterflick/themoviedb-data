With a choreography by Rodrigo Pederneiras, scenography and lighting by Paulo Pederneiras and costumes by Freusa Zechmeister, the creation of the Brazilian dance group is rocked by the original soundtrack woven by the hands of the Viganese musician and composer Carlos Núñez and by the Brazilian from (“the ocean”) of the city of São Vicente José Miguel Wisnik,  from the only set of pieces of music from the Galician-Portuguese medieval profane songbook that got to us with their respective original sheet music: the famous cycle of the ocean in Vigo, by Martín Codax. The seven chants, dated from the XIIIth century, are the oldest testimony and the most appreciated survivals of one of the aspects of the troubadouresque tradition in the region at that time: the so called “friend chants”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sem Mim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grupo Corpo","original_name":"Grupo Corpo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed0c956aaec7100206b41dd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","original_name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0c965e61e6d001ecf9cc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
