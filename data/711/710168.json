Written and directed by Sebastian Pańczyk, produced by studio Dobro and with visual effects created by Platige Image artists. Smoke plays important visual role for Syny – not only at concerts and live performances. Even the lyrics of “Nag Champa” are dedicated to the smoke generator, so it could not be missing in the video as well. Smoke is present almost in every frame of the film and creates mysterious, slightly unreal atmosphere.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SYNY: Nag Champa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Pańczyk","original_name":"Sebastian Pańczyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0e8a121c4ca001fdd5ed7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11372228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
