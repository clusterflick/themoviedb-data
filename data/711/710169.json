And become a pure silent movie performance. Suddenly it appears to be less powerful & impactful. Theatrical essence of propaganda is clear & striking. Journalists & hosts are actors on the scene of post-Greek theater embodying tragedy on screen. \"The Society of the Spectacle\" needs its own Avengers & propaganda fill these needs with fine actors. Sound is something we strive to find on YouTube, in social media or TikTok. Silent videos become uncomfortable unless they aren't filled with entertainment (including guns, murders or big newsbreak slogans).","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Arrivee d'un train à La Ciotat: propaganda 2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svyaznoy","original_name":"Svyaznoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0e92ae4b57600202d8399","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12320430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
