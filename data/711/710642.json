In the 18th century, its heady atmosphere of freedom produced an extraordinary cultural flowering. Famous artists like Vivaldi, Tiepolo father and son, Canaletto, Longhi, Guardi, Goldoni and Casanova hurled themselves into a giddy whirl of libertinage while leaving their stamp on the unique city. Then, in 1797, Venice surrendered to Napoleon Bonaparte. Carnival was over, and the masks came off.  Venice: Flamboyant to the End transports us from canal to canal, palazzo to palazzo, bathing us in the magical atmosphere of this maze of a city and conjuring up the uniquely flamboyant Venice of the 18th century.","popularity":0.1859,"poster_path":"/7aX3slh6r8pasEfD6Sd9qIoy1uv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illégitime Défense","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16457,"logo_path":"/9Wt2lcSsdMphUlt9UsguVSkiJaj.png","name":"Rmn-GP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venice: Flamboyant to the End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Venedig: Måleriet, musiken och erotiken","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Renauld","original_name":"Isabelle Renauld","popularity":0.3283,"profile_path":"/sFCZqQFyxiznqsCIJZ1FPDNqgLQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5ed2b5cbfea0d7001e875202","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2284580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Buscatto","original_name":"Mathieu Buscatto","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/6byCUHKpjjmmVEAvWZ9INKc55MH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5ed2b5dc528b2e00206c4c17","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2072047,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christophe Trarieux","original_name":"Christophe Trarieux","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed2b5ae21c4ca0020e3aaa5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2544513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Thiriat","original_name":"Laurence Thiriat","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed2b57daaec71001f6c522e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211944,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leslie Grunberg","original_name":"Leslie Grunberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed2b58c5c071b001c2cca65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2544513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Thiriat","original_name":"Laurence Thiriat","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed2b577fea0d7001e8751c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7aX3slh6r8pasEfD6Sd9qIoy1uv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1406}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Deutsch\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"Deutsch\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
