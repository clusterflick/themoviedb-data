Director Noel M. Izon captures their stories through the voices of the veterans themselves – only half of whom are still alive today – and delivers touching personal accounts of the men’s contributions and sacrifices during the war. Despite the fact that they endured a bleak, racist prewar climate and were not even considered U.S. citizens, these individuals rallied to join the war effort and cement their rightful place in American history.","popularity":0.1852,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Untold Triumph: America's Filipino Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Diamond Phillips","original_name":"Lou Diamond Phillips","popularity":1.917,"profile_path":"/yqGZwaGe8XgoxfO7zmx7weGBaXZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ed15e2121c4ca0020e1545d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855486,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Noel Izon","original_name":"Noel Izon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed15e0eaaec71001f6a34b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0367189","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Estimated","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
