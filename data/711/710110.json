First and foremost, the artistic creators of Grupo Corpo had to delve into the universe of Afro-Brazilian religions in preparation for the theme proposed by Metá Metá. However, the performance is far from being a mimetic representation of these syncretic rituals. Instead, the choreographer Rodrigo Pederneiras re(constructs) the powerful glossary of gestures and movement he accessed as he experienced rites of  ‘Camdomblé’ as well as ‘Umbanda’, particularly  ‘Exu’ ceremonies (giras de Exu).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gira","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grupo Corpo","original_name":"Grupo Corpo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed0c51796386400236e03db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","original_name":"Rodrigo Pederneiras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0c528e4b576001f2f002c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
