The film focuses on a Southern-Limburg clan in California and shows how this small group stays loyal to the Dutch-Limburg traditions and habits. In the spirit of the long-gone 50s the emigrants visit the church every Sunday and arrange a weekly night of cards. Many things they are attached to do not exist in America, and tragically also not anymore in the country they left behind.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1996-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle Frank","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frans Bux","original_name":"Frans Bux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6079555a66f2d2006d2f8421","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Bux","original_name":"Tiny Bux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"607955709f37b00040687ee7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900352,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rene Heijnen","original_name":"Rene Heijnen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6079553cfbe36f0029a94ea9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Heijnen","original_name":"Hans Heijnen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed20f061b157d001e51695f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rolf Koot","original_name":"Rolf Koot","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed20f1f1b157d001f51c5c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Heijnen","original_name":"Hans Heijnen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed20f2faaec710021693555","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557677,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Booy","original_name":"Alex Booy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed20f6896386400226e31ba","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659838,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ewoud Hendriksen","original_name":"Ewoud Hendriksen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed20f8b21c4ca0021e0072f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0128800","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Dutch\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"nl\", \"native_name\"=>\"Dutch; Flemish\"}","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
