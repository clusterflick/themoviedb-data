In just 15 years, under Deng Xiaoping’s leadership, China raced forward at an astonishing pace to become a never-before-seen hybrid of communism and capitalism. The world’s most populous nation has reinvented itself, changing from a relatively undeveloped and isolated nation into an economic giant and a major international power. For many Chinese, this transformation has brought unprecedented prosperity, but it has also raised troubling questions of national identity and social inequality.","popularity":0.366,"poster_path":"/6RjmXGhU5HzkSwMKNUKItwF6OGE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambrica Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part Three: Born Under the Red Flag 1976–1997","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"China: A Century of Revolution — Born Under the Red Flag, 1976–1997","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516314,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Kao Hwang","original_name":"Jason Kao Hwang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b85114956500502c8f31","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1241717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith Vecchione","original_name":"Judith Vecchione","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b893079a97006659ab48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Williams","original_name":"Sue Williams","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed35ad121c4ca0020e4a48a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Williams","original_name":"Sue Williams","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed35ae69638640024738fec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0118850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6RjmXGhU5HzkSwMKNUKItwF6OGE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"英语","note":"","release_date":"1997-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
