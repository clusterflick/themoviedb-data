The film begins with the celebrations marking the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, a moment of great hope for millions of Chinese. But the quarter-century of Mao’s rule was as turbulent as the decades which preceded it. Interludes of relative calm and increased prosperity were interrupted repeatedly by violent campaigns, purges, and a famine in which killed more than 30 million people. It culminated in Mao’s colossal and tragic experiment, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When Mao died in 1976, people were exhausted by the turmoil and longed for stability.","popularity":0.5308,"poster_path":"/bnnx5nMSbPadw5nwDOTukTEnpL8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambrica Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"GBH","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part Two: The Mao Years 1949–1976","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"China: A Century of Revolution — The Mao Years, 1949–1976","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Lyman","original_name":"Will Lyman","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/ymifKdrtMFEZVYTvOmYoshPg7HR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"62467960126ec3004e18811f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Williams","original_name":"Sue Williams","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624678deb3440900a5117500","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tan Dun","original_name":"Tan Dun","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624678ed8ee49c00648039ee","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1241717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith Vecchione","original_name":"Judith Vecchione","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6246795066f2d2006395b304","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025271,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Howard Sharp","original_name":"Howard Sharp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6260b7c5079a970095bf6c02","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue Williams","original_name":"Sue Williams","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed35c2721c4ca0020e4a646","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0293392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bnnx5nMSbPadw5nwDOTukTEnpL8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"英语","note":"","release_date":"1994-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
