Against the backdrop of a changing world, and channeled through the bodies of eight young dancers, Franco and De Keersmaeker offer an updated version of their own earlier work. As a part of their strategy they invited the young choreographer and dancer Louis Nam Le Van Ho to confront his own writing with De Keersmaeker’s choreography; his contribution builds a bridge to a new generation of creators and choreographers, providing a different perspective on De Keersmaeker’s and Franco’s ongoing examination of the essence of dance and composition. Franco joins Rosas’s dancers on stage, performing the piece live on the piano. In a broad historical gesture, the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Brahms, Arnold Schönberg, and Anton Webern stretches across the geometric principles and improvised sections of the choreography.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zeitigung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183882,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","original_name":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0cb8196386400226d2a32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
