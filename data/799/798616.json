Survivors and relatives report how they experienced the night of the crime and the months after it and how they defend themselves against the logic of the perpetrator who wanted to make them strangers in their own homeland. Since that February night, they have been fighting for the memory of the victims and for clarifying what happened. And they ask many pressing questions about the night of the crime and the perpetrator that no one has wanted to answer so far. The documentary consistently looks at the crime from the perspective of the bereaved and uses their stories to tell about troublesome life of a citizen of foreign descent in Germany today, about inequality and about the everyday racism of the authorities and educational institutions.","popularity":0.1678,"poster_path":"/rgTFUq3oibLJuxTr9puUcwdJlCz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"#SayTheirNames","title":"Hanau -
