The nomads' herds of reindeer move on thin ice. The warming in the Russian Arctic is becoming dramatically visible. Huge craters open in the thawing permafrost and expose dangerous viruses and bacteria. Forest floors dry out and the taiga catches on fire. The pack ice off the coast is melting and depriving polar bears of their habitat so that they approach human settlements in their desperation. The changes in the nature of the Arctic Circle combine with the measurements of researchers and observations of the indigenous people to form a disturbing overall picture: In the Russian Arctic, Pandora's box has been opened! The film team had the chance to shoot in regions that were been restricted areas for decades. The documentary shows in impressive and depressing images already existing effects, phenomena and ominous interlinkages of global warming.","popularity":0.3582,"poster_path":"/dhBOyRtPPXbAFbpwOvw64KcPX6d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94587,"logo_path":"/nYpIYwEo5bJK4JHEAvoMsrRVnNc.png","name":"Altayfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Thin Ice","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Coup de chaud pour les rennes de Sibérie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Auf dünnem Eis","type":"festival title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Erlebnis Erde: Rentiere auf dünnem Eis","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Klimabomba i Sibir","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Gerhardt","original_name":"Annette Gerhardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6031752220ecaf003e162ccc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Romanovsky","original_name":"Vladimir Romanovsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"6031753a6e3deb003e095dda","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Michel Claverie","original_name":"Jean-Michel Claverie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"60317554c26796003dca73a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Volkovitsky","original_name":"Alexander Volkovitsky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"6031756b9af171003d43981d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetsuya Hiyama","original_name":"Tetsuya Hiyama","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603175810a517c003e9309cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Gavrilo","original_name":"Maria Gavrilo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603175a176eecf003d65955b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Egor Kirillin","original_name":"Egor Kirillin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603175bbc26796003fca9421","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roman Petrov","original_name":"Roman Petrov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603175d0befb09003e8ed224","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juri Shdanov","original_name":"Juri Shdanov","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603175e47d5f4b003f95868b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonid Serotetto","original_name":"Leonid Serotetto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"6031760cc26796003eca817c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Egor Gorokhov","original_name":"Egor Gorokhov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603176567d5f4b0041959045","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khudi Timofei","original_name":"Khudi Timofei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603176757d5f4b003f9587b1","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludmila Vanujto","original_name":"Ludmila Vanujto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"603176866e3deb003f08c5ea","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":992639,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry M.
