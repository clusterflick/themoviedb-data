Only a few members are under 85 years old. As of recently, however, young Israelis are once again learning German. The film tells both stories: that of an intense and painful experience, and of a not entirely impartial curiosity. And so a space for dialogue is formed across generations - and the language is German.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Klang der Worte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerhard Schick","original_name":"Gerhard Schick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60300579944a570040166164","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1337649","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
