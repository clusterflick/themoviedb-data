In the first film, the pair and Clarkson each try to live as classic car enthusiasts with a particular classic car - Hammond picks a MGB GT, Clarkson chooses a Fiat 124 Sport Spider, and May drives a Peugeot 304 S Cabriolet - testing out their choices, before modifying and improving their cars, and competing against each other to see who's choice is the best. In the second film, the trio see which is the best second-hand 4x4 SUV on a budget of Â£250 - Clarkson pics a Vauxhall Frontera Sport RS, May chooses a Mitsubishi Shogun Pinin, and Hammond drives a Jeep Cherokee - facing a series of challenges that concludes with a race in which the loser must conduct an awkward after-dinner speech at their destination.","popularity":0.7683,"poster_path":"/a1PtKURyDaSgzPFhBeOz9EsLH1G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The end of an era","title":"Top Gear: The Big Send Off Special","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Top Gear: Series 22 Episode 8","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"602f895532cc2b0040845a00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hammond","original_name":"Richard Hammond","popularity":0.755,"profile_path":"/3H4Qz0Fpn36BBpS8kiY2gIpezZs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"602f895f4ccc50003ea660f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James May","original_name":"James May","popularity":0.9897,"profile_path":"/hiYZZKlWPPuo1KJjQErkzpTehKZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"602f8967efe37c003fbd1411","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236943,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Wilman","original_name":"Andy Wilman","popularity":0.0783,"profile_path":"/3N1V7RnkHNaOjAvJaqaLYIvbaBO.jpg","credit_id":"602f8a723e6f2b003e060006","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Churchward","original_name":"Phil Churchward","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/dFxstWbplR2vb5GqHnX6o9obNZ5.jpg","credit_id":"602f8c2109dda4003c104c3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4763228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3uoPtnVedBYA8OrR8cP3r7XHBr5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1374},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1B8wIzQOfDs6Cc5CMHR7ilFtNBh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1372},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":748,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/winSSBJDZDIOIqiLnLpB7Dl5GOt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1330},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kfHWPHP8I7fP71bz1pmVsriA4JJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1370},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":771,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiB5RgTYhDsAowMy5LzIZxMiu6v.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1371},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fLJSWe9QfaqErXRD3Vn5bBXiYFR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1589,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1PtKURyDaSgzPFhBeOz9EsLH1G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195721,"name":"double feature"},{"id":264598,"name":"tv special"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC","release_date":"2015-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
