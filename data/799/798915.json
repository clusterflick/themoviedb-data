The Netsilik Eskimos of the Pelly Bay region in the Canadian Arctic had long lived apart from other people and had depended entirely on the land and their own ingenuity to sustain life through the rigors of the Arctic year. The filming was done during the summers of 1963 and 1964 and in the late winter of 1965 under the ethnographic direction of Dr. Asen Balikci of the University of Montr√©al, assisted by Guy Mary-Rousseliere, O.M.I., both anthropologists of wide Arctic experience. Quentin Brown was Producer-Director, and Kevin Smith the Executive Producer for the series. A minimum of cultural reconstruction was required during the filming; the Netsilik families readily agreed to live in the old way once more and showed considerable aptitude in recalling and representing the earlier ways of life.","popularity":0.1808,"poster_path":"/3WJfizBHFsoZUfubYzY1qC0ekez.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Education Development Center (E/D/C)","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":630,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Netsilik Series","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Brown","original_name":"Quentin Brown","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60314e08c6006d003eca189f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Brown","original_name":"Quentin Brown","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60314e30c26796003dca406a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2984892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Asen Balikci","original_name":"Asen Balikci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60314e78dfe31d003f9bc5ea","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Mary-Rousseliere","original_name":"Guy Mary-Rousseliere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60314e9396e30b0041233aac","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Smith","original_name":"Kevin Smith","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60314ec1dfe31d003e9bb440","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3WJfizBHFsoZUfubYzY1qC0ekez.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eaVGvndGl0paizDNdj2FhgpBodv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
