As Lettie shares about her missionary work in the Orient with her husband Charles, Lettie reflects on how their big goals to reach every person in Japan are interrupted when Charles becomes ill and the two are forced to return home. During the decline of her husbandâ€™s health, Lettie begins writing a journal as the Lord gives her and Charles encouragement from the Bible and the library of books they had collected through their work. Little did they know that the journal would become the most beloved Christian devotional of all time, and their missionary work would continue to this day in over fifty countries on six continents.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/3VEtlcBuvVytjwh9vJlqv5kN2QK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Streams In The Desert-Words Of Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Bash","original_name":"Derek Bash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Car Buyer","credit_id":"6030097120ecaf003c1496e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1794830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Bash","original_name":"Heather Bash","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/86e8nKlfbvdSjZKEFUraI3s9OvZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Young Lettie B.
