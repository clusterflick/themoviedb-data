After attending the wake, the three go bar-hopping at an izakaya (tavern) and hostess bar in a town they’ve never been to, but they cannot find a way to cope with Kaji’s death. The next day, they go to Kaji’s parents’ house and receive, from his younger sister, Junko, a fan letter addressed to him. The letter is from a young Korean girl, and apparently, Kaji read it many times over before he passed away. The news of the death of Kaji, who was not a famous actor even in Japan, had no way of reaching a fan in Korea. The three are left at a loss as to how to tell her the news.","popularity":0.6174,"poster_path":"/csN7bZsyXSV8ND3TqWSRWAnuY8z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ramblers 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Yamamoto","original_name":"山本浩司","popularity":0.4336,"profile_path":"/w1ywYvhyoQ45244n1Bm1iPtmG6n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kinoshita","credit_id":"6030491270b444003f7fcd23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keishi Nagatsuka","original_name":"長塚圭史","popularity":0.4404,"profile_path":"/kKO5XdQhaZ3whyV75Jnar0hFGIc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tsuboi","credit_id":"6030493706f984003eec790d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeshi Yamamoto","original_name":"山本剛史","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/1QcQE09KgyLigZfy3CQpuM7rlOv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Funaki","credit_id":"6030494d9af171003d42569d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiro Yamashita","original_name":"山下敦弘","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/g4yJWbaA0scDMqFHJjSU6G3Ho8Q.jpg","credit_id":"60304987b4a543003f10e476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiro Yamashita","original_name":"山下敦弘","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/g4yJWbaA0scDMqFHJjSU6G3Ho8Q.jpg","credit_id":"6030499cc3c8910041da6875","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.76,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/csN7bZsyXSV8ND3TqWSRWAnuY8z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
