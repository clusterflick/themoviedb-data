Bubbles are formed but slowly the water regains its still quality. The glass then acts as a deformative device between the viewer and the artist, as a hand is writing \"don't do to her what you did to me\" on the back of the photographs. Everything is still again for a short while until, slowly and majestically, a flush of black ink flows downwards, staining the water...  The ink preludes the more dramatic fate of the repeated haunting images, the deceased woman.  One hears a metallic sound as the photographs move in a more frenetic spin.  One is aware of the glass again, of the limited space where a struggle takes place between a probable spoon and the photographs which dematerialise under one's eyes.  The sheer immediacy of the destruction process is intensified as the image dissolves into an organic paste.  Then, a woman, the artist, drinks the solution, the last ironic phase of the talisman.\" -S.Z","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xcMxk4cTmytSS7cR5vmGlrdktRw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Do To Her What You Did To Me","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2982658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zineb Sedira","original_name":"Zineb Sedira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602e86c7d94035003d780eff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xcMxk4cTmytSS7cR5vmGlrdktRw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
