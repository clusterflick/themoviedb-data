In desperate Gaza -not a country but a strip- people dig tunnels because the borders are too well-guarded. Not even a sheep may cross the border. So a shepherd who has run out of ideas takes his sheep along with him into the tunnel. Desperate, absurd and yet comic. Sombre and monochrome. Animation as if modelled with soil.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":"/bbk8mBBUdGT8oLCSwel0ffNqWU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maryam Kashkoolinia","original_name":"Maryam Kashkoolinia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602ff47a09dda4003b104d4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3080076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1179,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bbk8mBBUdGT8oLCSwel0ffNqWU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":786}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
