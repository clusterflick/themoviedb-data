In the pilot a few characters looked slightly different. Bokko's appearance was more rabbit-like and less feminine, and she didn't yet have the black tips on her ears, or the tuft of black hair on her head. Pukko didn't have his Beatle haircut. And Koichi looked much the same, but his face was altered slightly for the series. The pilot for the series is largely the same as the first episode – and some footage was reused for the first episode – but differs in a few respects; mostly with regards to how Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko first meet Shinichi. It is also only about 15 minutes long, and ends with Koichi's discovery of a hidden base, which isn't part of the first episode.","popularity":0.1194,"poster_path":"/vZ9QbrVtYx1uUtNyubG6V7SEyE4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20327,"logo_path":"/drfbo2T51CU0gvV5PWCre19P8nG.png","name":"Mushi Production","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amazing Three Pilot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Wonder 3 Pilot","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Wonder Three Pilot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Osamu Tezuka","original_name":"手塚治虫","popularity":0.918,"profile_path":"/4xOgZySBani7h7xkFwK4Rf0MqNg.jpg","credit_id":"602fc881cee48100420dad9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZ9QbrVtYx1uUtNyubG6V7SEyE4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
