A woman is looking after an obviously blind man. She undresses, bandages and dresses him again. Since the action takes place on two temporal planes running in opposite directions, the couple's relationship appears to be in a state of stagnation. In-between, we are shown the images in the protagonists' minds: nightmares, an optical machine, but also erotic dreams from perhaps better days. Tango motifs and an aria (composed by Anthony Moore) reinforce the impression of a romantic chamber piece. The man's blindness refers to the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau, who destroyed his sight through keeping his naked eye fixed too long on the sun while researching into the persistence of luminous impressions on the retina. The pictorial technique, with layer after layer dissolving into one another, is reminiscent of the overpainting technique deployed by the director in her work for the canvas.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/9anPdfzi1UAdYeZYbmUznqVU6lE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blindman's Ball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4591208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Moore","original_name":"Anthony Moore","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f25d80e9da6901635ed199","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dore O.","original_name":"Dore O.","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/aqs4hsNBxdZug5EpAcrrMrrQp0b.jpg","credit_id":"602eb28d44ea54003fd74359","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9anPdfzi1UAdYeZYbmUznqVU6lE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
