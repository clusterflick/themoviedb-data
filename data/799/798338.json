Even in the sweatshops of New York they heard about Petaluma where the Jews were not the shopkeepers and the professionals, they were the farmers.  Meet this fractious, idealistic, intrepid group of Eastern European Jews and their descendants as they confront obstacles of language and culture on their journey towards becoming Americans.  Jack London, California vigilantes, McCarthyism, the Cold War and agribusiness all come to life in this quintessentially American story of how a group of immigrants found their new home, a home on the range.","popularity":0.3714,"poster_path":"/pjrkHgHowCymn1IHzvPKi1O4vMN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonnie Burt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Home on the Range: The Jewish Chicken Ranchers of Petaluma","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983100,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bonnie Burt","original_name":"Bonnie Burt","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602ee068b04228003fd118a0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bonnie Burt","original_name":"Bonnie Burt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602ee0765f4b73003f1d3538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983102,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith Montell","original_name":"Judith Montell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602ee08e8c7b0f003f623a84","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Montell","original_name":"Judith Montell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602ee09ab042280040d11700","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pjrkHgHowCymn1IHzvPKi1O4vMN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5888,"name":"agriculture"},{"id":7059,"name":"anti-communism"},{"id":10144,"name":"antisemitism"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":192279,"name":"usa history"},{"id":245769,"name":"jewish history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
