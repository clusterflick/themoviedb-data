In between the rampant foliage are thousands of stones – large and small, some artistic-looking, others simple, some magnificent and crumbling; some nameless and others with indecipherable inscriptions.  Weißensee is the largest Jewish cemetery still in use in Europe. It is so large that it could contain approximately eighty-six football pitches. Walking through the cemetery is like taking a walk through history and the list of famous artists, philosophers, lawyers, architects, doctors, teachers of religion and publishers who are buried here is long indeed. Not many are aware that in a few years’ time, this protected area will officially be listed as one of UNESCO’s world heritage sites.","popularity":0.1382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88787,"logo_path":null,"name":"Britzka Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Heaven Underground: The Weissensee Jewish Cemetery","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Im Himmel, unter der Erde - Der Jüdische Friedhof Weißensee","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Wolff","original_name":"William Wolff","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f08151255bc3500332136e1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Britta Wauer","original_name":"Britta Wauer","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e939251416c7515b0eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48771,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karim Sebastian Elias","original_name":"Karim Sebastian Elias","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6849420e0a262be694d067","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793966,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kaspar Köpke","original_name":"Kaspar Köpke","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6849220e0a2656279d37dc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793967,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Berthold Baule","original_name":"Berthold Baule","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c68492e9251412fb4057826","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Britta Wauer","original_name":"Britta Wauer","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6849150e0a267b909d17d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Britta Wauer","original_name":"Britta Wauer","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c68494e9251412fc6057de6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1833710","wikidata_id":"Q1659384","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cW7zaex8IsQJaOTKFbMPTnR7evY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/n5Lb5LXaqbw2o9Y2VBts7jFwwIL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
