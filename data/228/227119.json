The band then took to the road for an extensive tour which included this 1995 live concert in Dusseldorf filmed for Germany’s famous Rockpalast TV series. The set features several tracks from the “Stranger In Us All” album alongside classic Rainbow and Deep Purple tracks. The band are on blistering form and Ritchie Blackmore shows just why he is so revered as a guitarist. This previously unreleased show is a great addition to any Rainbow fan’s collection.","popularity":0.1813,"poster_path":"/g5REmxY8NcfIKjS7A2WXewpK9Jd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Black Masquerade is a live concert by British Hard Rock band Rainbow","title":"Rainbow: Black Masquerade","video":true,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow: Black Masquerade","type":"Alternative"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ritchie Blackmore","original_name":"Ritchie Blackmore","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/m6AeffGBbRvKHdiw3dgyyiMa9gD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"5426df900e0a2655620001d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Morris","original_name":"Paul Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3zm5poApf9qN2QTOBtb3XD0jAq8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Keyboards","credit_id":"5426e00e0e0a26557200019d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doogie White","original_name":"Doogie White","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/zF6Ka12HEYjR0M1bchahYGlH90f.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"5426e031c3a3680b2100019e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1083804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candice Night","original_name":"Candice Night","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/ugx2ZmPRpqeGPP2XJhcQa203JvB.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"612ba007e04aca0043e35672","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2227502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Burgi","original_name":"Chuck Burgi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3wZ87Nhv6NIzicHX8aNW3ekXAaJ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"612ba04439b6c3004223f792","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Smith:","original_name":"Greg Smith:","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/8sLgfVvurAz3Y83dnYhXeJZTUkh.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"612ba1cba4af8f0043d32f51","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerd F.
