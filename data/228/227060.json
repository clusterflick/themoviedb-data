A camera trained on the theater's front doors shows a crowd exiting. Most patrons are well dressed: some women carry muffs, almost all wear hats, some are elaborate; the men are in suits, as are many of the boys. All are white. Occasionally, the camera pans up to the marquee. The same people exit more than once; a woman pushing a baby carriage exits twice, By the end, the crowd is more animated, moving more quickly, smiling more. A final shot shows the whole theater in the frame, a crowd in front, a restaurant above.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claremont Theatre, N.Y.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0336180","wikidata_id":"Q21184370","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Claremont Theatre in New York City (1915 Original Black & White Film)","key":"cGjtFJg1HM4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-02T04:17:58.000Z","id":"67496d03b3ac67c96bafdd6b"}]}}}
