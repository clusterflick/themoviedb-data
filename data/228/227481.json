His name was Pierre Delpeuch and in the last days of his life he and his comrades shared an extraordinary human adventure. Exhausted, cut off from the front, huddled in their trench, Pierre and four others bravely stood firm. Facing them was another trench containing five similar exhausted and determined Germans. Their only aim was to resist, whatever the cost, until reinforcements arrived.","popularity":0.2782,"poster_path":"/1XIfw4APTwl702TX6SlDuyG8jyg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Native","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trench of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Yves Berteloot","original_name":"Jean-Yves Berteloot","popularity":0.3625,"profile_path":"/x8uFQOAsLSbWcbRMyItUj2nMZuo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pierre Delpeuch","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d633","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":378552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristiana Réali","original_name":"Cristiana Réali","popularity":0.7742,"profile_path":"/c2dZ7nQCjRDP9ion7iODsTPazzc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sylvaine Morillon","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d637","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Putzulu","original_name":"Bruno Putzulu","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/dM26X3josyxBavgTEqvb6XSG5cd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lieutenant Saint-Jean","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d63b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc-Antoine Diquéro","original_name":"Luc-Antoine Diquéro","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/9rOKHWW4PM0IPYicKDjtreqz9PM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gustave Hornoy","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d63f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Jérôme Esposito","original_name":"Jean-Jérôme Esposito","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/6tRAkwLPymCve7FUXfOTDUJGRxX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Zéphyrin 'Zeph' Biron","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d643","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Lochet","original_name":"Bruno Lochet","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/SNuKtVcGejDrxmMrvHBksrTs5x.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ludwig Boehm","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d647","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Baumgatner","original_name":"Julien Baumgatner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Auxence Memling","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d64b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benoît Giros","original_name":"Benoît Giros","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":"/niFbrR8FSWJgVpFzkY1VVRods1R.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Willy Reinicke","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d64f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Vadim","original_name":"Christian Vadim","popularity":0.2308,"profile_path":"/h2nNJv5jqxZrlpygTgGDJHEXc9L.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ernst Wegel","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d653","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Mlekuz","original_name":"Mathias Mlekuz","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/e0gryLs0wxbiMSwOr71F423rB39.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Johan Landrock","credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d657","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Louis Lorenzi","original_name":"Jean-Louis Lorenzi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c7515d65d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0386831","wikidata_id":"Q3213243","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1XIfw4APTwl702TX6SlDuyG8jyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Luchon Film Festival","release_date":"2003-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 2","release_date":"2003-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
