They are aided by a talented but mysterious cast. It becomes apparent that the men are engaged in a dangerous game with their own mortality. When one of the men falls in love with the leading lady, the rules of the game are threatened, but the men's overarching desire to transcend their worlds and feel complete - once expressed - can never be controlled. Three of the men must experience what it is like to die, and for the other, the opposite.","popularity":0.0082,"poster_path":"/fI8HIC2F5Tg5aCXfC95Pqtkt8Nw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We set out to be wrecked.....","title":"The Boy Castaways","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505070,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Judd Overton","original_name":"Judd Overton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62688781924ce600a066b714","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082004,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lisa Tomasetti","original_name":"Lisa Tomasetti","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626887b5614c6d00662d0676","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kantor","original_name":"Michael Kantor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eaf9251416c7515ecdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1805805,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Jen Rossiter","original_name":"Jen Rossiter","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a603436c3a368776600f818","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Hairstylist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1805805,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Jen Rossiter","original_name":"Jen Rossiter","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6034519251415a5800eef5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2642912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fI8HIC2F5Tg5aCXfC95Pqtkt8Nw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
