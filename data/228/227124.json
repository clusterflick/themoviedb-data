When Ahimsa was a young boy, a shaman had the mysterious man removed, but the man returns when Ahimsa is a young man and starts taking drugs and getting involved in rave culture. Ahimsa's behavior soon causes trouble for his friends, Ukhoht and Einstein, and a female physician, Dr. Pattaya.  The film was Thailand's official entry to the 79th Academy Awards. It was chosen after Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's \"Invisible Waves\" had been withdrawn by the Federation of National Film Associations of Thailand.","popularity":0.1581,"poster_path":"/p5LjYPSMj3sU0mV03PkRZ3aCONP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25484,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.S.
