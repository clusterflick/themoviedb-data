From a formal podium, she attacks the white male power structure of the US. Next she takes on her parents. Then, the volume lowered and the background the streets of New York, she lets us know what she thinks of life, of herself, and of us, anyone who's watching or listening. Life is depression, despair, and death. She's the girl next door gone bad. And us? Compliant sheep. Lunch lays out a challenge.","popularity":0.2327,"poster_path":"/qwL1OOOpuEa3jb3KwYH1Jwt9j5K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gun Is Loaded","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Lunch","original_name":"Lydia Lunch","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/xVuLoTxLvqhGplZ3cGqe7ckay5c.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"57f12e82c3a36859130024ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merrill Aldighieri","original_name":"Merrill Aldighieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f12ebf9251414abf000215","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Tripician","original_name":"Joe Tripician","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f12ecbc3a36859130024d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486271,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.G.
