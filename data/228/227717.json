It's received by \"Wolf\" Larson, who immediately throws it away, but his sensitive, dreaming--and short--buddy John McPherson snags it, and begins a correspondence with Evie, pretending to be Wolf. But things get complicated when Evie wants to meet her tall, handsome soldier. And even more complicated when Wolf sees Evie and likes what he sees.","popularity":1.1507,"poster_path":"/mCkk81hTnQO34pFcmzH4xMmTAl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter for Evie","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1215925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marsha Hunt","original_name":"Marsha Hunt","popularity":0.4358,"profile_path":"/r4vTrX77yxFSTbIYXZVWRaDfCZ3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Evie O'Connor","credit_id":"52fe4eaf9251416c7515ec65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carroll","original_name":"John Carroll","popularity":0.3552,"profile_path":"/jYbxj0cK0BilxRIjTyc5cs8vyND.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Edgar 'Wolf' Larson","credit_id":"52fe4eaf9251416c7515ec69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hume Cronyn","original_name":"Hume Cronyn","popularity":0.6138,"profile_path":"/dM7Yfswa4Hi6TU9jvMFrT9RbEDx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John Phineas McPherson","credit_id":"52fe4eaf9251416c7515ec6d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spring Byington","original_name":"Spring Byington","popularity":0.3843,"profile_path":"/uXyfIzuEwtMhcFufThCITAAxKRh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. McPherson","credit_id":"52fe4eaf9251416c7515ec71","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Britton","original_name":"Pamela Britton","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":"/dRDBaqZRfyKFSiBf5ZgbM6sVFuY.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Barney Lee","credit_id":"54771ee7c3a368764e00400f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Lloyd","original_name":"Norman Lloyd","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/z7jg1zuFfC5jqn4kI40OGAOrD5U.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"DeWitt Pynchon","credit_id":"54771ef6c3a36836cc0020fd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Percival Vivian","original_name":"Percival Vivian","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Mr. McPherson","credit_id":"54771f26c3a368069c002567","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Curtis","original_name":"Donald Curtis","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/2VrI2eZXGhESrx9E5EuAbGtqkFF.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Capt.
