The title refers to a custom in some parts of Rajasthan—where aristocratic women were long kept secluded and veiled—of hiring professional women mourners on the death of a male relative, a rudaali (pronounced “roo-dah-lee”—literally, a female “weeper”) to publicly express the grief that family members, constrained by their high social status, were not permitted to display—or at times, perhaps did not feel.  Underwritten by the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and Doordarshan (Indian national television) and based on a short story by famed Bengali author Mahasweta Devi—whose tales often focus on the travails of low-caste women.","popularity":0.3988,"poster_path":"/pXYf3GwYVU3xJlv1reKYq13QeEg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development
