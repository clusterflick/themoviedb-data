In this magical, yet forbidding place, wildlife coexists and behaves as nowhere else on earth. As this precious arc of habitat faces an uncertain future, threatened by chainsaws and fish farms, a team of dedicated scientists are racing to prove that it must be protected. National Geographic joins these experts on a 250-mile adventure through remote and unexplored territory, battling nature's most brutal elements and witnessing its breathtaking best. The scientists form a wilderness detective squad, collecting clues that will decipher the secret life of the forest's elusive inhabitants and perhaps even reveal a glimpse of the rare white spirit bear in Great Bear Rainforest.","popularity":0.2833,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Explore the wilderness at its breathtaking best","title":"National Geographic: Great Bear Rainforest","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":952516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Long","original_name":"William Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea19251416c7515cf97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10468,"name":"bear"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
