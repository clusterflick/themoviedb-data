But when his brother David is diagnosed with cancer, Chad's entire world comes crashing down around him.\r Chad has a shot at a full track scholarship at San Angelo State and David's earth-shattering news couldn't have come at a worse time.  Further complicating Chad's struggle is David's insistence on mending the bitter relationship between Chad and their father, who recently walked out on their family.  In this emotional fight to find out what really matters most in his life, Chad learns to trust God and to go \"beyond belief\".  This one hour mini-movie is built around six state-of-the-art concept music videos by the rock band Petra, featuring songs from the album Beyond Belief.","popularity":0.2737,"poster_path":"/veBleLSCQZdsYsnJdkruJ7LNOr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Word Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Petra: Beyond Belief Video Album","title":"Petra: Beyond Belief Video Album","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tony Leech","original_name":"Tony Leech","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Chad","credit_id":"5db868d3a1d3320011e753b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Rogers","original_name":"Jason Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"David","credit_id":"5db868dd0792e1001844fd73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2443944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hartman","original_name":"Bob Hartman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5db868f90f2fbd0011745ddb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2443946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louie Weaver","original_name":"Louie Weaver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5db86904a1d3320017e7fcc2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Schlitt","original_name":"John Schlitt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5db869112d37210013e9c1e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2443968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Cates","original_name":"Ronnie Cates","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5db8691aa1d3320017e7fcd2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2443947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lawry","original_name":"John Lawry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5db869220f2fbd001774ada6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5159449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicci Jo Witty","original_name":"Vicci Jo Witty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Warren","credit_id":"6779faf155d4b38f9366d884","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2342459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Maras","original_name":"Bob Maras","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Mr. Warren","credit_id":"6779fb059cb089e05166ce01","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monte Light","original_name":"Monte Light","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Young Chad","credit_id":"6779fb2cab5ec4c3dc729b04","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Maras","original_name":"Adam Maras","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Young David","credit_id":"6779fb409cb089e05166ce31","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5159450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Smith","original_name":"Larry Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Coach","credit_id":"6779fb6eeca85bd508726847","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5159451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Holder","original_name":"Tom Holder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"6779fb7e1a2df59ad374e74a","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443973,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J.
