Lacking any previous experience, they studied movies to learn the trade. The robbery did not go as planned and ended with the escape vehicle breaking down in front of a prison. Who where they and why would anybody chose such a solution? The film explores the real events of an absurd and tragic story from 2009 through the eyes of a Swedish filmmaker.","popularity":0.0542,"poster_path":"/xOsFtomE5QEWug0unMDsirHlXvM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wartburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Márton Kisteleki","original_name":"Márton Kisteleki","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"István","credit_id":"5db5eaba0f2fbd00146fb5d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Nagy","original_name":"Gábor Nagy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"József","credit_id":"5db5eb02d40d4c0012fd3643","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoltán Háberman","original_name":"Zoltán Háberman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5eb10d2c0c1001813b40f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"József Kó","original_name":"József Kó","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5eb1a0f2fbd00146fb660","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zsolt Pápai","original_name":"Zsolt Pápai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5eb233faba0001635970c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildikó Ritter","original_name":"Ildikó Ritter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5eb2dd40d4c0014fe74ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Károly Nyilas","original_name":"Károly Nyilas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5eb79d2c0c1001b14287c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Borbás","original_name":"David Borbás","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5eb9bd40d4c0014fe75e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Borbás","original_name":"David Borbás","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5ebbed40d4c0012fd3842","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442217,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Orsolya Vida","original_name":"Orsolya Vida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5ebf6d2c0c1001813b545","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Borbás","original_name":"David Borbás","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5ec000792e1001341810b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Csaba Szentgáli","original_name":"Csaba Szentgáli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5ec1c0792e10013418120","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442219,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dániel Tokár","original_name":"Dániel Tokár","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5ec920f2fbd00116fbec5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5311162","wikidata_id":"Q24734054","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xOsFtomE5QEWug0unMDsirHlXvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"Göteborg Film Festival","release_date":"2016-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wartburg - Trailer","key":"176082637","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-07-24T23:53:32.000Z","id":"5db5ed330792e1001540fa05"}]}}}
