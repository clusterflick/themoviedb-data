In short: Ali-Musa Sarhan, a refugee whose parents drowned while traveling by rubber boat on the Italian coast in search of a better life, is accepted by family, husband and wife who have lost a child. They are trying to find solace in little Arab and a sort of replacement for their early deceased son, Mark. Valeria (Donatella Finokjaro) and Paolo (Giorgio Tirabasi) are increasingly confronted with resistance from the environment and their own family, who do not accept their decision to keep Muhammad - It is also a story of a world that is increasingly sinking into xenophobic fog.","popularity":0.3777,"poster_path":"/ouwMK8HPPoeXKrFPw7wVmoKJnKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemusa","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":67007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nova
