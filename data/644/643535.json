The material removed is processed and returned to nature through forest liming. This measure attempts to counteract acid rain that troubles the forest floor. A cycle like a Mobius strip – an irreversible consequence due to the mining materials in order to restore the fragile natural balance. Lime dust delicately dusts the forest floor. A white, spherical alternative world opens, questioning our ambivalent relationship to nature.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/wx8Q9KknS9KrAhRrfWfuGXMsg5t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule
