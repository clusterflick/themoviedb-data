Nicolas’ Gidget is a self-absorbed young white woman who remains clueless to the violence erupting around her, ultimately to her own peril.  The film asks whether such police brutality would be tolerated if the victim were a middle-class white woman.","popularity":0.4065,"poster_path":"/x3XvRxDysAfdGkb0AHyut4hVPFd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gidget Meets Hondo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernard Nicolas","original_name":"Bernard Nicolas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/32KCaHyXnb9FESaizBi9rfhYsqU.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e348d96ac8e6b0015c29eaf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Skomal","original_name":"Peggy Skomal","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e34834715376c0013a79765","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Bruce","original_name":"Reginald Bruce","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e34834e76eecf00158e25c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Paspachel","original_name":"John Paspachel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e34835398f1f1001802da9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2525915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Contin","original_name":"Marie Contin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e34835815376c0017a79e31","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1094119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Friend","original_name":"Michael Friend","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/x9hW7GpoQI3PhADWiUi6n3TddIC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e34836143250f0013bfd027","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Amis","original_name":"Don Amis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e34837a43250f0015bfc83f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426458,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Caldwell","original_name":"Ben Caldwell","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/svBwooUn64i04lmhfMpcspMKy9a.jpg","credit_id":"5e348370ac8e6b001ac232fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernard Nicolas","original_name":"Bernard Nicolas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/32KCaHyXnb9FESaizBi9rfhYsqU.jpg","credit_id":"5e348d8a98f1f1001802e1e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2075189","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x3XvRxDysAfdGkb0AHyut4hVPFd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":796,"name":"police brutality"},{"id":12670,"name":"los angeles, california"},{"id":233840,"name":"black lives matter"},{"id":240240,"name":"l.a. rebellion"},{"id":337489,"name":"police shooting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
