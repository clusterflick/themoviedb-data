It is a conventional melodrama directed by Oscar Micheaux. Like many of Micheaux's films, Deceit casts clerics in a negative light. Although the film was shot in 1921, it was not released until 1923. It is not known whether the film currently survives, which suggests that it is a lost film.  The 1922 film The Hypocrite was shown within Deceit as a film within a film.","popularity":0.1428,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Micheaux Picture Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deceit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":249488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Preer","original_name":"Evelyn Preer","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/9zVKWL61QRhQwtHwtsVN8hmr6u7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Doris Rutledge/Evelyn Bently","credit_id":"5edd05a98d52c90023a5a079","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Fountaine","original_name":"William Fountaine","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5edd05ae9c24fc00236870c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Johnstone","original_name":"Norman Johnstone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alfred DuBois/Gregory Wainwright","credit_id":"5edd05b4f36a32001d8ac4fc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.B.
