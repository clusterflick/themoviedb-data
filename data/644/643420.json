Following 20 sold out shows in Los Angeles, his Sagayn tour took him to Yerevan, Beirut, Istanbul, Paris, Sydney, Cyprus, Geneva and a dozen other cities.\r Four years have passed since Sagayn and Berberian is thrilled about his new monologue. “I love writing, painting and directing, but being alone on that stage is a completely different sensation. I feel empowered, because there’s nothing more difficult than getting up on a stage and trying to make people laugh for an hour and a half. If you fail, you can’t blame anyone else for your failure and you’ll be crushed, but if you succeed, you feel exhilarated,” says Berberian.","popularity":0.2767,"poster_path":"/iy4SMdGbdYd9kwDXWeZ7DU49Sgk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wet Paint","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A funny, witty look on anxiety","title":"Yeté","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2230645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vahé Berberian","original_name":"Vahé Berberian","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/6R8X4442z0IKNG68bxO9U48D9AH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5db7c200d2c0c1001617c734","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christina Shirinyan","original_name":"Christina Shirinyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c2492d37210019e878bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vigen Khachatourian","original_name":"Vigen Khachatourian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c2312d37210013e8a2ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4iHE372jqv5DXquWRmyXRu78T5E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iy4SMdGbdYd9kwDXWeZ7DU49Sgk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215443,"name":"armenian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
