It certainly outshines Bohm's dated approach, and Bernstein's lethargically slow performance. (No disrespect to them, I enjoy them but this is better :) It also gives us a superb opportunity to view Solti at work, and I wonder why don't have more of his performances on video. One may also enjoy seeing (and hearing) Rene Pape at only 27 years old, likewise Cecilia Bartoli in her young prime.","popularity":0.4731,"poster_path":"/vPikd9d1pDcDTkJfP1qcnSkIOqh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't even bother looking for another version!","title":"Mozart Requiem","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234023,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Solti","original_name":"Georg Solti","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/aeGFb8BBQq8jIywJPpJJBaWF1EN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db9f6670f2fbd0011769f4e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Bartoli","original_name":"Cecilia Bartoli","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":"/wP24X3n757HiJgAbYpZJmwRqDpw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db9f67a0792e10013489cbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2356545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arleen Augér","original_name":"Arleen Augér","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db9f6aadbf1440016503c66","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db9f6dd89d97f0019bf214e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinson Cole","original_name":"Vinson Cole","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db9f6cfd2c0c100181a1564","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff34f75156cc70040f35f17","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"637ac915a3b5e60082951f88","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db9f70d0f2fbd00177728b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qdWNilMuMpc3trjjr1f2MB9BU0L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vPikd9d1pDcDTkJfP1qcnSkIOqh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":217325,"name":"masses"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"la","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
