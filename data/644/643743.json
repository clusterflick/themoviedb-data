Strangely enough, their campground happens to sit right beside an old creepy cemetery, named \"Ha Ha Cemetery.\"  As the night goes on, the group slowly starts to realize their stories are starting to tie together, and what starts off as a quiet night, soon becomes a night of terror.  What would make a group of campers decide to camp out beside an old cemetery? What secrets does \"Ha Ha Cemetery\" hold? Prepare yourself for four deadly tales of terror.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/3yMn6JngNp0qVH5xmf0tQnpaF5V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Night of Terror Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales From The Campfire","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2172357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave McRae","original_name":"Dave McRae","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":"/24ziSIkBfynbNSlvWkSSDXYd5F9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zombies (voice)","credit_id":"5db966f30792e10015472e0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Bolton","original_name":"Cody Bolton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ethan","credit_id":"5db9672ea1d3320014e938f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Bernard","original_name":"James Bernard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"5db967bdd2c0c100161a7e8c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon Tatlock","original_name":"Shannon Tatlock","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jade","credit_id":"5e9ee4e5d05a030020be4c54","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Bell","original_name":"Tim Bell","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db9660cd2c0c1001b1a40ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Bell","original_name":"Tim Bell","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db965f80792e10018467b1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Gallant","original_name":"Donna Gallant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ee523eec5b5002141974f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Gallant","original_name":"Donna Gallant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ee531d05a030019be4246","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tatlock","original_name":"Michael Tatlock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ee57ac92c5d0021b7a601","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tatlock","original_name":"Michael Tatlock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ee56deec5b50021419777","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tatlock","original_name":"Michael Tatlock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ee5541f3319001f4c45e4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3726408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yMn6JngNp0qVH5xmf0tQnpaF5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Capitol Theatre, Moncton","release_date":"2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
