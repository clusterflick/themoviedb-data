For the concertos, Bernstein enlisted the services of some of the finest Brahms interpreters of the time: the violoninst Gidon Kremer, the cellist Mischa Maisky and the pianist Krystian Zimerman. Seeing Bernstein enjoying himself while conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in these lighter, familiar works by Brahms added to the pleasure I got from them. The Academic Festival Overture is especially well done. Some conductors don't seem to get it, but Bernstein did.","popularity":0.3775,"poster_path":"/cDPoMzerb44t3q9uIW46zjVLQjI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Highly recommended","title":"Brahms Academic Festival, Tragic Overtures/ Variations on a Theme by Haydn/Serenade No. 2","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dba047a2d37210019ebde03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff37398fbe36f003ff933d9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dba04902d37210019ebde19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26178,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Brahms","original_name":"Johannes Brahms","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/6cZcrCSTaQ8DuMcvD5q5Py8EMn5.jpg","credit_id":"5dba04a02d37210019ebde29","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cDPoMzerb44t3q9uIW46zjVLQjI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":192471,"name":"orchestra conductor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
