Dickie Rogers takes a liking to the stranger who is allowed to remain to do odd jobs and to entertain the boy. An old man who is hard of hearing mistakes Lighton for \"Lightning\" and the nickname sticks. Uncle Henry, heir to Dickie's share of the estate in the event of the latter's death, has been systematically cheated at cards by Bill Harvey, who now demands his money, using dire threats. Fearing a penitentiary sentence, Uncle Henry sees Dickie rolling helplessly in his wheel chair towards a cliff and does nothing to save him. Lazy Lightning saves the boy's life and the uncle covers himself by pretending to have sprained his ankle. Following the fright, the boy weakens and is close to death. The doctor thinks he can save him with serum. Uncle Henry goes in the car to get the serum. Mistrusting him, Lazy follows him to town on horseback through a driving rainstorm. A lost film.","popularity":0.3335,"poster_path":"/pDikPWoyJvNJvLhDyjkbbVd3dKX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lazy Lightning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Acord","original_name":"Art Acord","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/oQkLrz7mdwkawVQE9KtMTM7ydDL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lance Lighton","credit_id":"5db70ff83faba0001637a803","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay Wray","original_name":"Fay Wray","popularity":0.5033,"profile_path":"/zE36ekZdFQ53Bvk5JauwIeOeKlR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lila Rogers","credit_id":"5db7100b0792e1001842b172","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gordon","original_name":"Robert Gordon","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/6XrlAuz0rmQHaoePkqDm5zUZ4vH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dickie Rogers (as Bobby Gordon)","credit_id":"5db71021d2c0c100161640e2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vin Moore","original_name":"Vin Moore","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sheriff Dan Boyd","credit_id":"5db7104f0f2fbd001771def8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Morrison","original_name":"Arthur Morrison","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Henry S.
