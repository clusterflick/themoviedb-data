And staying there until the rehearsals are concluded and the concert is about to begin. The conductor goes on stage and moves in front of the orchestra. He lifts his hands in the air - ready to embody music. In his documentary 'Brossé', Jacques Servaes gives us a behind-the-scenes look at the day-to-day life of conductor and composer, Dirk Brossé.","popularity":0.1257,"poster_path":"/aOYumEAFwhgaZx7Ay931E2AVJHw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54850,"logo_path":"/kcZniXFtwC4vE3YqK7TRrovzxVA.png","name":"Bulletproof Cupid","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":22071,"logo_path":"/b3YwzlhTVkrcv1G6nl8XHJBidZk.png","name":"Mollywood","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":56961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canvas","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Destiny in Music","title":"Brossé","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk Brossé","original_name":"Dirk Brossé","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/voAjz2rDB5ZeUa0YEjVMn5qcL6U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5db71d1f0792e1001842d52b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427507,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Els Voorspoels","original_name":"Els Voorspoels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db71d7c2d37210015e72a62","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk Brossé","original_name":"Dirk Brossé","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/voAjz2rDB5ZeUa0YEjVMn5qcL6U.jpg","credit_id":"5db71d892d37210015e72ab8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Servaes","original_name":"Jacques Servaes","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db71d3ea1d3320017e54568","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Goossens","original_name":"Kathleen Goossens","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db71d6a0f2fbd001771ef2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Servaes","original_name":"Jacques Servaes","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db71d523faba00014378e24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3237084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOYumEAFwhgaZx7Ay931E2AVJHw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
