One night he finds Barbara Seaforth, a young blind girl, lost in the swamps and takes her home. The two unfortunates fall in love, marry, and have a child. One day, a visiting doctor tells Jerry that Barbara's sight can be restored. The operation is performed successfully, but the doctor warns his patient to shield her eyes from the light or risk reversal of the surgery. Barbara, realizing her husband's dread of exposing his disfigurement to her, looks at her child and then permanently blinds herself by staring into the light, thus sacrificing her sight for the love of her husband.","popularity":0.3397,"poster_path":"/jsaffKzcBjzIrE5klS22MkOgv8F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kendall-Chambers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of the Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Martin","original_name":"Vivian Martin","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/wtuYbYrRgqLbuyqFyrR4QmsKu7a.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Barbara Seaforth","credit_id":"5e27a3f12dda89001956f884","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Leiber","original_name":"Fritz Leiber","popularity":0.2443,"profile_path":"/hWMaGqZ2eMAsGlywuytymjx9uKl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jerry Wendover","credit_id":"5e27a3f84ca67600123ff0f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2517317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles E.
