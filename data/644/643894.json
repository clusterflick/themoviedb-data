He was not alone. Many other anonymous French men and women wrote of the beauty and warmth of those summer months and how threats of war were far from their minds.

about to unfold.","popularity":0.2566,"poster_path":"/8cPGrqgCK94ZjSkdcWUYAEQDCQo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18740,"logo_path":"/11dLmhNuO6Pgd8tSDvktsOkP94R.png","name":"Zadig
