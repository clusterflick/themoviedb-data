She is returning home to the Philippines for the first time in 30 years. En route home, she delays her return by stopping over in Singapore. Her interactions with her fellow Filipinos help her reflect on the nature of her loss, the cycle of sacrifice and longing that marks them all.  Gripped by the fear of returning home to a life she has left behind but is still intricately connected to, she finds moments of enchantment among other lost souls. They have created their ways of living with disenchantment through a Dreamtime that shelters them from the storms of trauma.","popularity":0.4438,"poster_path":"/eO72T2Rb9dNxrCdNIzO0RG8fLAF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33812,"logo_path":"/fwpLmRnRFxnYg9mD8K4FOb0GqwT.png","name":"Sine Olivia Pilipinas","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":360,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henrico's Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charo Santos-Concio","original_name":"Charo Santos-Concio","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":"/dLuewCQj4GqnzHg4uCxmW2ypXt6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0200dbf14400135042ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaina Magdayao","original_name":"Shaina Magdayao","popularity":0.3621,"profile_path":"/nL10Qbz1bqDawZIhr5xZ8LMJqLF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0217d2c0c100181a2fcd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":462483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angeli Bayani","original_name":"Angeli Bayani","popularity":0.1953,"profile_path":"/8lESf7mxEKl9ETLOfMO91ol2MmD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba022289d97f0019bf2d1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Orencio","original_name":"Hazel Orencio","popularity":0.1665,"profile_path":"/AwvWttoj4qkf87KXoVvdPtvfAy6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0230a1d3320017ea5950","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lav Diaz","original_name":"Lav Diaz","popularity":0.5557,"profile_path":"/p3XjMo6C30EKbtsutBZgXhkH0vD.jpg","credit_id":"5dba02460f2fbd001176aad0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lav Diaz","original_name":"Lav Diaz","popularity":0.5557,"profile_path":"/p3XjMo6C30EKbtsutBZgXhkH0vD.jpg","credit_id":"5dba0254a1d3320011e9b35f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12194720","wikidata_id":"Q124332327","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eO72T2Rb9dNxrCdNIzO0RG8fLAF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
