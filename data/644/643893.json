Choreographer and text writer was John Neumeier who had been requested in 1972 by ballerina Marcia Haydee to write a full length ballet. He suggested \"Lady of the Camellias\" , the Dumas fils autobiographical novel. The idea of using Chopin music was suggested by ballet conductor Gehart Markson. The ballet was a success and this version was also presented in 1979 at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. Neumeier revised it for the Hamburg Ballet now directed by Brazilian ballerina Marcia Haydee after the death of famous director John Kranko. The revised version with sets and costumes by Jugen Rose and conducted by Heribert Beissel was recorded as a movie in 1987.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/nCz5T99mreUoNl7bC0taqjZP3A2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Ballet beyond Beautiful","title":"Die Kameliendame","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Haydée","original_name":"Marcia Haydée","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/uYYkkLdVMMn5sHJiYNFK1G5tzGa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba09f60792e10018478137","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Liška","original_name":"Ivan Liška","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0a0f89d97f0019bf3645","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francois Klaus","original_name":"Francois Klaus","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0a2cd2c0c1001b1b43e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2365123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Scott","original_name":"Colleen Scott","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0a51dbf1440013504c41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimír Klos","original_name":"Vladimír Klos","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5dba0a632d37210019ebebd3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188766,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Neumeier","original_name":"John Neumeier","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":"/mAKpaiKDisBlWbmnQu6xXFxJosn.jpg","credit_id":"5dba09030792e10018477f97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nCz5T99mreUoNl7bC0taqjZP3A2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
