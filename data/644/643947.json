The film’s character, Ima Plume  (pronounced EE-MA PLOOM), is a chalk-talk specialist or public illustrator who draws before small audiences.  Her chalk talks are represented in the hand drawn animation segments. An homage to film noir, it explores Ima Plume’s investigation of her own death.  Ima, Public Illustrator, grapples with trying to express things that might not be seen or drawn including: spirits, electronic voice phenomena and studies of animal locomotion.  The film combines chalk and drawn animation, puppetry and live action.  It is both fiction and documentary.  Inspiration for the content and style is taken from pioneers of film, vaudeville, photography and spiritualism.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Haunted Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1413666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Andrews","original_name":"Nancy Andrews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dba50c50792e10013496cb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
