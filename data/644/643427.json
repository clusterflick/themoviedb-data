A young woman home alone receives a call from a stranger, a young man asking her to the pictures.  She declines but later finds the man with a knife standing in her dining room. He wants to have sex with her and seems confused about whether his intentions are brutal or romantic.  Seeing his confusion and fear she talks him into letting her go outside to bring the washing. He holds his knife at her back – she realises she has no chance of escape. As they are walking back across the lawn to the house she is stung by a bee. She collapses. Weeping she tells him she is allergic to bees and convinces him to go inside to get vinegar from the kitchen to stop the swelling. As soon as he is out of sight she is up and running in one fluid movement. The intruder is left standing desolate on the lawn with the vinegar bottle – his fantasy unravelled.  We find him at the pictures alone.","popularity":0.1124,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young woman - faced with a panicking armed intruder - acts with a steadiness and presence of mind which leads them out onto a lawn, where a bee, and the intruder’s uncertainty, gives her the chance to escape.","title":"Apis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie McBride","original_name":"Sophie McBride","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"5db7c9b7d2c0c1001b17e0d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron McGregor","original_name":"Aaron McGregor","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/c1gqmXdfXC8wvVi7OPBnfYj24JA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"5db7c9bf2d37210013e8c5c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Brown","original_name":"Warren Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Man at Door","credit_id":"5db7ca252d37210019e88ab4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356763,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgina Allison Conder","original_name":"Georgina Allison Conder","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c9670792e10013451d54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55941,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ainsley Gardiner","original_name":"Ainsley Gardiner","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/9WSqXq4XNjouFDPsv5mauR0JV68.jpg","credit_id":"5db7c9700792e10013451d74","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139347,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ginny Loane","original_name":"Ginny Loane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c97ea1d3320014e6b6cb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443646,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Glen Maw","original_name":"Glen Maw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c9872d37210013e8c4c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066982,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Wedel","original_name":"Paul Wedel","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c9900792e100184417e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182835,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Price","original_name":"Simon Price","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db7c99d3faba00016392f74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":989349,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Amanda Neale","original_name":"Amanda Neale","popularity":0.3573,"profile_path":"/zIC2UYEwrr0sI4DEOXQFBCFRQ3k.jpg","credit_id":"5db7c9aca1d3320014e6b7cd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loren Taylor","original_name":"Loren Taylor","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/b7Tu2hSU0rFmg5LHMrMlQOQ6lCW.jpg","credit_id":"5e473b66134d5800122e6046","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loren Taylor","original_name":"Loren Taylor","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/b7Tu2hSU0rFmg5LHMrMlQOQ6lCW.jpg","credit_id":"5e473b882d93750017a4ec83","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
