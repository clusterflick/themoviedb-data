No so when Leacock was hired to produce this twenty-minute version of lab mayhem. Try this: six researchers in a lab at MIT in the late 1950's show-off the power of electro-magnets, and in the process, accidentally set an experiment on fire. Or this: half way through the film the phone rings off screen, and host Francis Bitter says \"tell 'em I'll call 'em back later\" while he's looking at the camera, discussing bus bars. Leacockâ€™s fleshed out all the personalities here, from \"Beans\" Bardo, who cranks up the generator to nearly explosive proportions, to the mysterious Mr. Lin, who barely peeks over his shoulder at us, seemingly in mockery, disdain, or curiosity.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Magnet Laboratory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Leacock","original_name":"Richard Leacock","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/t3laii6SV2HYNvuQa910UmbHNQV.jpg","credit_id":"5dba51820792e10013496e47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
