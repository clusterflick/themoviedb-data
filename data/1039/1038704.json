When Herbert learns of his wife's love for Harry, he disappears with Kansas, a tramp. Soon after, Beatrix falsely identifies a body at the morgue as her husband's and marries Harry, but when Herbert, still alive though ill and demented, appears at her door with Kansas, she confesses her lie to her new husband. Kansas' plans to blackmail Beatrix are ruined when Harry visits the two tramps, and Herbert, now dying of tuberculosis, pleads with Kansas to leave the couple in peace. Kansas agrees, and after Herbert's death, Beatrix and Harry return to a normal life. - From AFI","popularity":0.1755,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buchanan's Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Pearson","original_name":"Virginia Pearson","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/5zNG6IdLbUZzZb1Howmj9W9tM8c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Beatrix Buchanan","credit_id":"63545124255dba007defaec1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc McDermott","original_name":"Marc McDermott","popularity":0.1734,"profile_path":"/9EJdvYFJ99t3PgwwwMpF5moApuf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herbert Buchanan","credit_id":"63545132a843c1007d88c168","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Sutherland","original_name":"Victor Sutherland","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/aBNQYBHWywmHxG8oIfJXjp3volI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harry Faring","credit_id":"6354514f417aaf00826a5cc6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Finley","original_name":"Ned Finley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/Ah16RW8yAiENiPKKfiNUvVTAIFc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kansas, a tramp","credit_id":"63545159a843c10091b2f4aa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Brabin","original_name":"Charles Brabin","popularity":0.2724,"profile_path":"/6nq1IU9TZp0d6jQts7NoGVsbn2O.jpg","credit_id":"635450d5d8e225007a1a8f15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Justus Miles Forman","original_name":"Justus Miles Forman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635450e34ca676007a5345e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345871,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adrian Johnson","original_name":"Adrian Johnson","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6354511243250f007ab631f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008934","wikidata_id":"Q21752621","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
