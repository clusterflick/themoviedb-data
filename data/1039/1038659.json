In the last moments of the Civil War, the Air Raid Shelters became the safest place to save the lives of thousands of people during the bombings. They sheltered fear, but also the story of many people like Maria, a young dreamer, eager to show the world that love can overcome anything. That it doesn't matter if a thousand bombs fall, as long as love exists, there is hope. A hope that she imagines with Carmen, a young woman from the Santa Cruz neighborhood, daughter of fishermen, with whom she maintains a close relationship. A secret relationship, full of clandestine meetings in the shelters.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/s82kE4IDkOdyrn04glRNAUNIZuG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dios te salve, María","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Rojo","original_name":"Irene Rojo","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/jAxaYRWsqQpj4t1mnQ8g9U1pW6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63542572a843c1007aa0760d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Aroa Pérez Ruíz","original_name":"Patricia Aroa Pérez Ruíz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63542575244182007f23f51e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilde lladó","original_name":"Matilde lladó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63542581a843c1007aa0761c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Checa","original_name":"Sergio Checa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6354258a946318007d5912c3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie-Estel Soard","original_name":"Julie-Estel Soard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6354253e880c92007e703217","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noelia Fluxá","original_name":"Noelia Fluxá","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63542549a843c1007d88b6fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22313292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/s82kE4IDkOdyrn04glRNAUNIZuG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
