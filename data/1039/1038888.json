In a few weeks time, she will make her first Holy Communion in church. Just like her parents, grandparents and grandparents once did. That is a very special moment in the Catholic faith,\" says grandpa. Merle is looking forward to the beautiful clothes and gifts she will receive for her communion party, but is not yet sure what to think of what the religious teacher tells her at school about Jesus.
