Juanita was an unforgettable Sydney character with her large beehive hairdo, long false eyelashes and fashionable clothes. Glamorous and well-connected, Juanita built a powerful alliance between construction workers and residents that stopped Sydney's developers in their tracks. With millions of dollars at stake, Juanita's disappearance remained unsolved. Filmmaker and artist Zanny Begg explores this mystery through the eyes of those living in Sydney today. Bringing together a cast of actors, performers, activists, stripers, sex workers and beekeepers, Juanita Nielsen NOW probes what it means to live in a city that killed one of its own.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dQGZsZ5elKFdleiVuaErtpewO7D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108808,"logo_path":"/gOFd3qU0VUisi2DTsz8ZKQEKoXQ.png","name":"Enigma Machine","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juanita Nielsen Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2127091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zanny Begg","original_name":"Zanny Begg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/79sZNhX29jVlM1jpEWs89p2v2hY.jpg","credit_id":"6353a120880c9200796d5c9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":38777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philippa Bateman","original_name":"Philippa Bateman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6353a16cd8e225007a1a5c77","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22855164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":977,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQGZsZ5elKFdleiVuaErtpewO7D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
