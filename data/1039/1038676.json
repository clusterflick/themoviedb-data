While Eric is at sea with Captain Scudder on a boat owned by Jim and Hiram Hawley, a jealous villager spreads the tale that Ruth is illegitimate, and the townspeople inevitably snub her. Jim Hiram sets his boat on fire after its arrival in port so that he can collect insurance money, and Ruth, believing that Eric is on board, tries to rescue him. When Ruth and Eric escape safely, Captain Scudder reveals that he, Ruth's long-lost father, was legally married to her mother, which re-establishes Ruth's good name and enables her to marry Eric.","popularity":0.3443,"poster_path":"/1ZJaTYFJxTHijO7iejaHpjLoGbH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakers Ahead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ruth Bowman","credit_id":"63542fe443250f007d0434d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifford Bruce","original_name":"Clifford Bruce","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/9wxa9dLCxFDCMO2qeCInBFIBUzd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eric Pixley","credit_id":"63542ff0255dba007defa825","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Van Buren","original_name":"Mabel Van Buren","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/qrr0LCl0UvnV5BoCgHj11ksjC4G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aunt Agatha Pixley","credit_id":"63542ffcf3b49a007dd3d652","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Simpson","original_name":"Russell Simpson","popularity":0.2131,"profile_path":"/sZAJ7TS52RxyejiirXhhqmYxxwn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Scudder","credit_id":"6354300956b9f7007e2ef6be","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Pallette","original_name":"Eugene Pallette","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/y3n1c9qjmJzGeZWihwm0QWlmDoR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jim Hawley","credit_id":"63543012255dba007defa834","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Deane","original_name":"Sydney Deane","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/aX7cEajVpsH5N4A4gmauUjvDEXO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hiram Hawley","credit_id":"63543022f3b49a007a84a93d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibson Gowland","original_name":"Gibson Gowland","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/5peWO8JpDAgeb5NPGoOWvkpiyhX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mike Burley","credit_id":"6354302e385202007a026927","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Foster","original_name":"Lorena Foster","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nurse, Eliza","credit_id":"6354303dd8e225007d993140","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Jerome Eddy","original_name":"Helen Jerome Eddy","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/qy5pFT1KLmBzPxZW2osoQGLdP87.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Agnes Bowman","credit_id":"6354304d9590e3007fa5fa14","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Brabin","original_name":"Charles Brabin","popularity":0.2724,"profile_path":"/6nq1IU9TZp0d6jQts7NoGVsbn2O.jpg","credit_id":"63543063946318007d5914e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Brabin","original_name":"Charles Brabin","popularity":0.2724,"profile_path":"/6nq1IU9TZp0d6jQts7NoGVsbn2O.jpg","credit_id":"6354306dc9dbf9007f027c6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.P.
