Six tractor drivers and their families were thrown off the plantation on which they had been working for $6 a day, because they were striking for higher wages. The film follows the families, who lived in tents through the winter, as they began to build their own homes. They were urging people in the surrounding Delta area to go to Washington to demand housing for the many, many others who needed decent and affordable housing. They put up tents across from the White House, hoping to bring the plight of the people of Mississippi before the nation and the world. Made with support from the Delta Ministry, the National Council of Churches, and Neighborhood Developers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strike City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Douglas","original_name":"John Douglas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/dHTsZ1t905sdweGtuA5n9QLd5fT.jpg","credit_id":"63538b725f4b7300835c8189","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Douglas","original_name":"John Douglas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/dHTsZ1t905sdweGtuA5n9QLd5fT.jpg","credit_id":"63538b50417aaf00826a2889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Griffin","original_name":"Tom Griffin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63538bd49590e3007fa5cca2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Griffin","original_name":"Tom Griffin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63538be92441820082f2e1b1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Douglas","original_name":"John Douglas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/dHTsZ1t905sdweGtuA5n9QLd5fT.jpg","credit_id":"63538b8b43250f0082592f45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Griffin","original_name":"Tom Griffin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63538bfd880c9200796d563b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"American Film Festival - Blue Ribbon Award Winner","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
