For 15 days the documentary team will record them, as well as their friends, family and colleagues, making a recap of their 18 years together. What nobody knows is that Ricardo wants to leave Ana, but hasn't had the courage to do so. The documentary forces him to face this reality and, in his search for answers, he involves three very close friends who share different views about their relationship and what he should do. With each conversation, he becomes even more confused.","popularity":0.2349,"poster_path":"/4aIDSwlva6NlAZZX9KiNGCpTcJ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every love story has a color version and a black and white version.","title":"Já Nada Sei","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Just Let Me Go","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2978933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duarte Matos","original_name":"Duarte Matos","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xoCKcJbcDClxFH58AMvDei7Rewr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ricardo","credit_id":"635337749369a2007c2c2caf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Lopes","original_name":"Ana Lopes","popularity":0.8317,"profile_path":"/eUoo8K1PT5H0BPx7HDqzfWglQnK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"63533783a843c1007d885e8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susie Filipe","original_name":"Susie Filipe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"63533793c9dbf90082372764","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric da Silva","original_name":"Eric da Silva","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/c7VoexEHz40xNkKxiYOpIa9GH05.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Valter","credit_id":"6353379fa843c1007aa02697","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3226379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rui Oliveira","original_name":"Rui Oliveira","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/cJe92Euw2T31XmpW6adRWKclQLt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"635338c115c636007a99ee44","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diogo Lima","original_name":"Diogo Lima","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/uH519xePpE2Amlv3mCAoGNG3Zij.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Pedro","credit_id":"66e60599e8211ecd22b042df","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751921,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luís Diogo","original_name":"Luís Diogo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63533615a0f1a20090b0f028","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3751922,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luís Diogo","original_name":"Luís Diogo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635336e215c636007a99ec2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298532,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luís Diogo","original_name":"Luís Diogo","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635335f8f8e98200817b20be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866743,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Farate","original_name":"Pedro Farate","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63533701a843c1007aa025c4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511312,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"António Costa Valente","original_name":"António Costa Valente","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":"/h1Tq5YndU0Cf1d4L5JhPScDDofd.jpg","credit_id":"635336d5417aaf007f69e5a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298532,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luís Diogo","original_name":"Luís Diogo","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63533608244182007ab6366f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19488354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/4aIDSwlva6NlAZZX9KiNGCpTcJ8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alexandria Film Festival)","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
