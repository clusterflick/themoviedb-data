This raw and deeply affecting portrait of Kenya gives an insider’s view of the impact that violence has on the community, and how complex life is for them. The film begins shortly after Kenya witnesses her friend Paola being murdered by a client. The film follows Kenya closely. Will the family accept burying Paola as she was: a flamboyant trans woman? Kenya approaches Paola’s loved ones with great respect and understanding—something she rarely experiences herself. When the murderer is released, she embarks on a lengthy battle for justice, backed up by her “sisters.”","popularity":0.3452,"poster_path":"/y3kZfIFTUhPq6VlVaD1t1UmDWWN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":299,"logo_path":"/elssmtHcogGtF8Gxokh9phZvLKi.png","name":"Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kenya","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4275677,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Juan Miguel Nasra","original_name":"Juan Miguel Nasra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652d99e2ea84c700eba2f3a2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gisela Delgadillo","original_name":"Gisela Delgadillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63539ca143250f007ab600e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gisela Delgadillo","original_name":"Gisela Delgadillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636652fbe004a6007959ab12","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256604,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leandro Motta","original_name":"Leandro Motta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6366533d1684f7007f782e0d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gisela Delgadillo","original_name":"Gisela Delgadillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63665313651fcf00833235bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3752284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gisela Delgadillo","original_name":"Gisela Delgadillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63701745798e06007fe5d40b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28498936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zxasq2ZueXAsibhMsht3NRZK8r9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/y3kZfIFTUhPq6VlVaD1t1UmDWWN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":571,"name":"transsexuality"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":323430,"name":"violencia de genero"},{"id":334538,"name":"documental queer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
