Here, among the toxic residues, a happening takes place: a boy and a girl without knowing each other before are invited to undress and kiss in front of ‘fake’ journalists, photographers and operators. The soundtrack is composed by different environmental noises. The director denounces in this way the pollution and the landscape changing, focusing on the vision of two beautiful bodies kissing.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/bwsYmkOS29ar2BKOKCDRydXj2z2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1970-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can love prevail over decay?","title":"Loving in Marghera (The Kiss)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3847338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidiana Miotto","original_name":"Lidiana Miotto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63ab1139dd926a007d0dbdf8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3847339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Livio Morosini","original_name":"Livio Morosini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63ab1145c56d2d00d840c599","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3847340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Metelli","original_name":"Marco Metelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63ab115109dda4007cb9c7b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3847341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Bolani","original_name":"Valeria Bolani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63ab11601f748b008236289a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2628739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirio Luginbühl","original_name":"Sirio Luginbühl","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/hXp4u7b8irWTnAMSDBN9aiDTLQS.jpg","credit_id":"63542e0243250f007ab62ab2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2628739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirio Luginbühl","original_name":"Sirio Luginbühl","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/hXp4u7b8irWTnAMSDBN9aiDTLQS.jpg","credit_id":"66023e6cd38b58017d1ab211","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2628739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirio Luginbühl","original_name":"Sirio Luginbühl","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/hXp4u7b8irWTnAMSDBN9aiDTLQS.jpg","credit_id":"66023e720c1255017e1187ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3998739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nino Trainito","original_name":"Nino Trainito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66023ecc7f6c8d017c744473","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4615263,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Antonio Concolato","original_name":"Antonio Concolato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66023eae0929f601649bf06d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/loq9L5rBecFLUxXRkDOfZUnTdJT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bwsYmkOS29ar2BKOKCDRydXj2z2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
