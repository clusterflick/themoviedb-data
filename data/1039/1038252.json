The soul of the album is also a tribute to Pierre Henry, who was one of the foundational 20th century giants of electronic music: he explored solfeggio notes vâ€™s noise bites in audio spatialization before it was thought of. When he departed, I was very moved by the fact that he left some sounds to me for a future project that he thought relevant. Pierre Henry inspired me to create an album using the old analog techniques I studied, but linked to the future by using spatial audio technique already and foremost at the composition stage. .","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6NN80bOVmBmBOifiuNs5utBiXF4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oxymore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6NN80bOVmBmBOifiuNs5utBiXF4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
