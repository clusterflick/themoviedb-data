Ahead of his time in many ways, especially as an environmentalist, he is the longest-serving governor in the history of California, who eliminated the state’s billion-dollar deficit and enacted historic environmental and criminal justice reforms. From his early days in San Francisco as the son of Governor Pat Brown to his current work around climate change and nuclear threats, Zenovich’s timely film proposes a hopeful alternative to the current political morass.","popularity":0.9846,"poster_path":"/wOY6u5IpeaI5WcsdbOR4q6FEh1t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161915,"logo_path":null,"name":"PMZ Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":123442,"logo_path":"/lfEuVSDvjQCejdRyZaIORZzoxIn.png","name":"Blue Ant Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":195600,"logo_path":"/raR05O2dHolS08mMKRKHEPVl59i.png","name":"Slated","origin_country":"US"},{"id":99614,"logo_path":"/gXrb4q4TqBHCYEvjRa16WOE9NRs.png","name":"American Masters Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerry Brown: The Disrupter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3446021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Brown","original_name":"Jerry Brown","popularity":0.3763,"profile_path":"/vCm1WxgL9q55B5NDr7yE8x7iSeq.jpg","cast_id":30,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6775f2315b8f422b6012d865","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gray Davis","original_name":"Gray Davis","popularity":0.0866,"profile_path":"/qZt5hYTz9Wqj3FKpaA4MmDmb6DI.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6508c8158a88b200ad5db8b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3012005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Brown","original_name":"Willie Brown","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6508c827394a8700ada87bb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3829915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Brown","original_name":"Kathleen Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6508c8408c0a4800e318ca83","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Coyote","original_name":"Peter Coyote","popularity":1.5648,"profile_path":"/ld3xLYTcZWjAc0bE33DONT7n9o8.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6508c848373ac200e21bda2a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","original_name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","popularity":3.445,"profile_path":"/2marNcjIfCUE5Z2HyrcEiJHPbsA.jpg","cast_id":29,"character":"Self","credit_id":"660b4c9ba0be28017d727627","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ted Hope","original_name":"Ted Hope","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":"/atYPlQ6C8UwwKeMIfCdiWm6BjpQ.jpg","credit_id":"64f154e9e0ca7f012eb2b6c6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257537,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Herzog","original_name":"Mark Herzog","popularity":0.1604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f154f83a993700e2f80c9b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4246507,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Safran","original_name":"Tom Safran","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f15508dbbb4200e162d373","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Little","original_name":"Greg Little","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f15468dbbb42011b70f870","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"P.
