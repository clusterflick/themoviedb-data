Yin secretly begged her male cousin to conceive with her wife so as to carry on the family blood line. Eventually, Yin's wife got pregnant and the whole Lin family were thrilled, except for Yin's wife who felt desperate and lost, which was in sharp and dramatic contrast with Yin family's excitement. In the film, each one of them is pathetically but tragically bound by the traditional Chinese conservatism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/SPmuVldtTrI5hyoEN4XVmwhA8o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Lin Yin","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3750960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"曾汤尼","original_name":"曾汤尼","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635284d74ca67600825c47b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27011542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/SPmuVldtTrI5hyoEN4XVmwhA8o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
