His reflections are connected by songs that address miscellaneous news and social issues with egalitarian verve, sung by hot guys in a public toilet. A film full of meandering associations and unexplained references, it's at the same time a political musical and the taking stock of a romantic revolutionary. Anti-religious, anti-authoritarian and somehow also a bit anti-everything!","popularity":0.1309,"poster_path":"/v4F0q9F2J99qLIPtB0noOd90u7I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klappe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":96643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Bätscher","original_name":"Daniel Bätscher","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":"/60htk3e6YyoFr1CwECw3ExxV1ZT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6353fc8fc9dbf9007aff3b32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels Bormann","original_name":"Niels Bormann","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/jJGfDbDBBsTjQsW62ZyIoBdjgXn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6353fc9a9590e3007afbc51b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Butler","original_name":"Bernard Butler","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6353fca7c9dbf900823770da","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118828,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jürgen Brüning","original_name":"Jürgen Brüning","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/lPotlHebSBCrhmIfAFjaRrjnO3t.jpg","credit_id":"6353fc095f4b73007b859196","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118828,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jürgen Brüning","original_name":"Jürgen Brüning","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/lPotlHebSBCrhmIfAFjaRrjnO3t.jpg","credit_id":"6353fcbf9590e3007fa5ee84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4F0q9F2J99qLIPtB0noOd90u7I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
