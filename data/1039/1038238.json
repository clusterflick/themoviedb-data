His work is a history of the pop culture of our time: from iconic corporate logos (like ABC News and ORION Pictures) and book jackets (Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead) to some of the most instantly recognizable “title treatments” for such classics as WEST SIDE STORY, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, CABARET, LAST TANGO IN PARIS, MANHATTAN, and the James Bond gun logo. Caroff’s story is told by the centenarian himself, with reminiscences of growing up during the Depression and service in WWII, along with interviews with Phyliss Caroff, his wife of over 70 years, producer Mike Medavoy, and others.","popularity":0.4492,"poster_path":"/h17WQjxpdzJMjS4VEnK2EBDTK0K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10915,"logo_path":"/9NERkCpElyvb6RWNnWp4G4XWAKa.png","name":"Turner Classic Movies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Design: The Joe Caroff Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3751301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Caroff","original_name":"Joe Caroff","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6352b7b1c99826007ddcafc1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cerulli","original_name":"Mark Cerulli","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6352b78656b9f7007e2e8c08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cerulli","original_name":"Mark Cerulli","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6352baec5f4b73008d5661f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273454,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul C.
