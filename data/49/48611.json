It was an Oscar Nominee for Best Animated Short in 1991.\r Each piece of history is presented as a simple vignette, usually depicting a few simply-drawn characters arguing and making war, over and over again. Generally, a single figure is meant to stand in for an entire group (i.e., a single Caesar-like caricature for the entire line of Roman Emperors). There is very little spoken dialogue; instead, most of the cartoon is accompanied by a bouncy piano-driven score, which frequently changes style to suit the particular historical era. However, the score is all based around a single simple theme, to which it frequently returns in between vignettes.","popularity":0.0895,"poster_path":"/zkSkkmYNPzNKZsB9aykispsbNqP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1990-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grasshoppers","video":false,"vote_average":7.204,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Saltamontes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Bozzetto","original_name":"Bruno Bozzetto","popularity":0.2532,"profile_path":"/ccVFUBEF52mEeZm9Vp9EzoHApzQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe476dc3a36847f81350ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2901905,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Riccardo Denti","original_name":"Riccardo Denti","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdfc2375cc11d003d309ac7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2197893,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ugo Magni","original_name":"Ugo Magni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdfc29efb3f6100416986ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roberto Frattini","original_name":"Roberto Frattini","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdfc2b14a4bfc003f768342","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0099696","wikidata_id":"Q1051755","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQjcalCV1BJ4lvWHwkNAT7LE7SE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zkSkkmYNPzNKZsB9aykispsbNqP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
