It was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and a César Award. The film explores the impact of globalization on the various wine-producing regions, and the influence of critics like Robert Parker and consultants like Michel Rolland in defining an international style. It pits the ambitions of large, multinational wine producers, in particular Robert Mondavi, against the small, single estate wineries who have traditionally boasted wines with individual character driven by their terroir.","popularity":0.5206,"poster_path":"/ciXRSY7ScGESKXx40llMb4IMUsE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goatworks Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mondovino","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Nossiter","original_name":"Jonathan Nossiter","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/mHgPNxWCKmrVqsCTi5CgsVGoQq5.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4754c3a36847f812fc63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Nossiter","original_name":"Jonathan Nossiter","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/mHgPNxWCKmrVqsCTi5CgsVGoQq5.jpg","credit_id":"6307d29ab7d3520083aa3563","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Nossiter","original_name":"Jonathan Nossiter","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/mHgPNxWCKmrVqsCTi5CgsVGoQq5.jpg","credit_id":"6307d28985090f007a491b70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Nossiter","original_name":"Jonathan Nossiter","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/mHgPNxWCKmrVqsCTi5CgsVGoQq5.jpg","credit_id":"6307d29365c26c007aaad607","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Nossiter","original_name":"Jonathan Nossiter","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/mHgPNxWCKmrVqsCTi5CgsVGoQq5.jpg","credit_id":"6307d2b06e938a007eb5db85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":950707,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emmanuel Giraud","original_name":"Emmanuel Giraud","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6307d2a56c19ea0079a4a9f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72038,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Madeleine Gavin","original_name":"Madeleine Gavin","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/A9FsDNrrLSeXd5HSHees3codK5H.jpg","credit_id":"658b3192325a51577e036325","department":"Editing","job":"Consulting Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2423299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Preve","original_name":"Ricardo Preve","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/83A0udsFfNVvQ1MxV2tdBbaxc6w.jpg","credit_id":"667dc42cfa5143e3c1cc963d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0411674","wikidata_id":"Q289459","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sATDqrB9kjcAkwAbsMKAsK1UlXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ciXRSY7ScGESKXx40llMb4IMUsE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1447,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/64X3gx8nIeyEs74cqlOwSMupcmv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":964}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2004-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Deauville Film Festival","release_date":"2004-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York City, New York","release_date":"2005-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
