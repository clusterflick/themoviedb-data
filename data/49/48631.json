The story as such concerned the arrival of the real Chojin as he/she (a hermaphrodite) makes moves to wipe out all life on Earth. Interestingly, the setup for the show was far more heavily connected with the first two, more popular, chapters in the Urotsukidoji saga, with appearances by Nagumo and Akemi (unseen since the early episodes of Part III), and redesigned character models that more closely resembled the earlier episodes. Some of the less popular characters introduced in chapters III and IV, particularly Buju, were nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, such strategies did little to get this final saga off the ground and the story was shelved.","popularity":2.8983,"poster_path":"/ws5f3buzrRJQ4JSVwJtTSfmvVD4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urotsukidōji V: The Final Chapter","video":true,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chojin densetsu Urotsukidoji V: Kanketsu Hen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomohiro Nishimura","original_name":"西村朋紘","popularity":0.3692,"profile_path":"/3HggFRB2LO1GpfITnBGsT5pknzv.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"636c77d16611b4007f3dcfab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumiko Takizawa","original_name":"滝沢久美子","popularity":0.679,"profile_path":"/w38K587p9wYejcnFeBooCrvRPW2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2b869251414deb7425c2","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":554874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miyuki Matsushita","original_name":"松下美由紀","popularity":2.375,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2bcec3a368085f46bc28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rei Igarashi","original_name":"五十嵐麗","popularity":1.5972,"profile_path":"/sqfOHaLVkZu5zcTo5IZ41hxDJvq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2be39251414dce7417c4","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":60757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumi Takada","original_name":"高田由美","popularity":5.316,"profile_path":"/AbQMxvbJesosIIU0zw53tgZLIFM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2bfe0e0a26443401aa17","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":77933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriko Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口由里子","popularity":4.317,"profile_path":"/vNKJ6IykLF2uwGBe8AtjDe8LZ3.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2c14c3a368085846eb1e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisuke Gori","original_name":"郷里大輔","popularity":0.9142,"profile_path":"/g5OeBa8Rww8VNZiJuU7RhZxodwc.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2c350e0a264442018d42","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hirotaka Suzuoki","original_name":"鈴置洋孝","popularity":0.6376,"profile_path":"/6tUnO95OZiUwhHvxlJ3WP5lcsaJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5c3a2c480e0a264442018d54","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1032003,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toshio Maeda","original_name":"前田俊夫","popularity":1.292,"profile_path":"/aFhwSudiWB3hKS8fZPnFfgD2Sj1.jpg","credit_id":"5c3a2a870e0a264437018d8e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideki Takayama","original_name":"高山秀樹","popularity":0.4821,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3a2b1f9251414dd7742aab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112273,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nobuaki Kishima","original_name":"岸間信明","popularity":0.6315,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3a2b3b0e0a2644310182fe","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1221126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":734,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mjr6TvBUXZedefbpgH5u2vmOxrm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1306}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1828,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/ws5f3buzrRJQ4JSVwJtTSfmvVD4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210024,"name":"anime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
