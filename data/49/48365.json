The Lestingois family decides to take in the irrepressible bum, and he shows his gratitude by shaking the household to its foundations. With Boudu Saved from Drowning, legendary director Jean Renoir takes advantage of a host of Parisian locations and the anarchic charms of his lead actor to create an effervescent satire of the bourgeoisie.","popularity":0.8251,"poster_path":"/hCRUtli9TCrekxSysHJ15QhMk44.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Établissements Jacques
