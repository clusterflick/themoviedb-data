Then, oddly, people behave as if the picture is amazingly important. Later, it seems that this childish scrawl is somehow a map of the mythical city of El Dorado and people are willing to kill to get it. Eventually, a group of colonists use it to dig and dig for this treasure--only to end up blowing themselves up. Then, the natives all celebrate and live happily ever after.","popularity":0.3195,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chain","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Mulloy","original_name":"Phil Mulloy","popularity":0.2783,"profile_path":"/ygEse9ptM0z92cMPnNiM7cKjUmh.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4768c3a36847f8134007","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0356461","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tjq4rYdfi3kAe1z2bJlCm8Uthoo.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yxZKR6E5s06NheApLEqgZhD3SlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
