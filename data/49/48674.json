Weaving strands of poetic imagined drama, and archival footage into the interview, Preston presents both sides of her parents' wartime marriage: the horror and hardship of battlefield and prison camp juxtaposed with the loneliness and grief of a young wife struggling with a newborn baby and a husband declared missing.Ed Preston, on his way home from rugby practice in 1940, joins the New Zealand Army to go to World War II. His new wife, Tui, is pregnant and distraught, but he tells her not to worry, he'll be home by Christmas. And so he is - four years later - after escaping from a prison camp in Italy. But while Ed is away, Tui has fallen in love with another man.","popularity":0.5483,"poster_path":"/80fiXLyPwmdg2nKLN3Jt45seogp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2010-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film memoir of love, war and secrets","title":"Home by Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Henderson","original_name":"Martin Henderson","popularity":3.7283,"profile_path":"/avJFARzEPaB24rKQUYLinGQqilL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ed Preston","credit_id":"52fe4770c3a36847f8135a05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jed Brophy","original_name":"Jed Brophy","popularity":0.1685,"profile_path":"/8NOsHgZIscn9ObgN3vshCzHrl5H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mart Preston","credit_id":"534107810e0a2679a400192a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Barry","original_name":"Tony Barry","popularity":0.3804,"profile_path":"/uRPT91lZPoGba7A67B3ZXK9PWjl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"56920804c3a3684cff001114","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Blake","original_name":"Nick Blake","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":"/eC9GDVX5yo4BPrbF7Syhf6xaDVz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Les Harker","credit_id":"569208b792514115c80011b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Coll","original_name":"Byron Coll","popularity":0.1488,"profile_path":"/tMh9twYpO7aNhVYqYTj0IOnq3Kp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hoppy","credit_id":"56920933c3a3684d01001147","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hambleton","original_name":"Peter Hambleton","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":"/kxIJphwN4RWMKFxg2KatuCmFxnd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sgt Syd Gurton","credit_id":"5692095492514115bc00105f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Knowles","original_name":"Richard Knowles","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/6fEfu5cmavahGR6Pt0xnIvsI6oP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vic","credit_id":"5692099492514115d100115a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1561150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate McGill","original_name":"Kate McGill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/x8zSlxnWainnYp76oSD7YUeDyaJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Selina","credit_id":"569209ce92514115c500119f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelsie Preston Crayford","original_name":"Chelsie Preston Crayford","popularity":0.3182,"profile_path":"/kJBvjYTn9wDhFT51z8dHPDDHnHc.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tui","credit_id":"61f665ff81140f00439ed2a4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaylene Preston","original_name":"Gaylene Preston","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/u3jQ734Us6tubvgd4dvFIgdk85P.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4770c3a36847f8135a0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1601195","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/80fiXLyPwmdg2nKLN3Jt45seogp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yHdmfiMxASQiFcOVszqBAyFqoNZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer for NZ Film Home By Christmas","key":"u0Z6TU-XcNg","published_at":"2010-03-01T04:29:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"57eac3599251417e8a00043f"}]}}}
