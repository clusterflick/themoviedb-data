Its broadcast release coincides with the 50th anniversary of one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in history-James Watson and Francis Crick's discovery that the DNA molecule carries hereditary information in the form of a code that many scientists have likened to computer software or a written language. This discovery (announced on April 25,1953) sparked a scientific revolution. But it also left a fundamental question unanswered. Where did the information in DNA come from? How did the software in the cell arise? Unlocking the Mystery of Life explores these questions through the stories of a growing number of scientists who no longer believe that natural selection or chemistry, alone, can explain life's origin. Instead, they think that the microscopic world of the cell provides evidence of purpose and design in nature.","popularity":0.4263,"poster_path":"/5gweAzIv566B5WbBbmSL9D3GyTL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illustra Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unlocking the Mystery of Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Az élet rejtélyének megfejtése","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Ragozzino","original_name":"Ed Ragozzino","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5576ace3c3a368569a004333","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Pattle","original_name":"Fred Pattle","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Additional Narrator","credit_id":"5576acf1c3a36824d8006ba0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Behe","original_name":"Michael Behe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5576acfb9251413efe00650f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dembski","original_name":"William Dembski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5576ad04c3a3680e31001401","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip E.
