In search of some happiness, Martin takes off to the coastal town of Mar de Plata, where his older brother lives. Unglamorous, yet enchantingly addictive and refreshingly genuine, Acuña paints a confused and uncomfortable world, and makes us want revisit it over and over again.","popularity":0.3386,"poster_path":"/wTYslVk0T2QjlhiNlS7970p3WJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9962,"logo_path":null,"name":"BD
