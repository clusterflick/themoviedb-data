First the monk uses a rod and reel, then a net; over and over, he ends up fish-less and wet. Sleepless, he tries luring the fish at night with a bank of candles. He tries a bow and arrow. The tireless and insouciant fish leads the monk through a viaduct, over irrigated steppes, across cisterns, down canals. Suddenly, the monk's chase and the fish's teasing flight become a spiritual journey.","popularity":0.3021,"poster_path":"/r2T64qLkVHdll5sw5iDVa7OYbhA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8212,"logo_path":"/pkWt7XNwx5GssnXmTsXLKNpalaH.png","name":"Folimage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
