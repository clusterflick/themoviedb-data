Dan has just recovered from a scorching New York Times review, which forced his last show out of theaters prematurely. Now he faces a wider backlash against puppetry, suggesting an eerie parallel between himself and his new puppet-subject - a portrait photographer whose stunning body of work was very nearly lost forever.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How much can we feel for a block of wood?","title":"Puppet","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Soll","original_name":"David Soll","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4777c3a36847f81374e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1527710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
