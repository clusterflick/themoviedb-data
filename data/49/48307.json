Wavy Gravy is known as the MC of the Woodstock Festival, a hippie icon, a clown and even a Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream flavor. In Saint Misbehavin’ we meet a true servant to humanity, who carries his message through humor and compassion. The film weaves together intimate verite footage, reflections from an array of cultural and countercultural peers, and never-before-seen archival footage to tell a story that is bigger than the man himself.","popularity":1.1136,"poster_path":"/qJCWbV4KL1cwMBINfHhR45VNjaN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saint Misbehavin': The Wavy Gravy Movie","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wavy Gravy","original_name":"Wavy Gravy","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63deca3b373ac2007c1fe7f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3906108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Brilliant","original_name":"Larry Brilliant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63decacce559370083a4e1ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ram Dass","original_name":"Ram Dass","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/k5zWibF8jND1J9vkt4oPYLSTOnV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63deccb68741c4007db0181c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Ben Israel","original_name":"Steven Ben Israel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63decedd6ee3d70093eaa7e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":941022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buffy Sainte-Marie","original_name":"Buffy Sainte-Marie","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/a5vesobh2O3PqXJU34Lr9D7RV5j.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63deceef9974ee0083610d24","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lang","original_name":"Michael Lang","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/gexMoEHwupMNJ1ehDCICDjzwIQW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Woodstock Creator & Producer","credit_id":"63decf14ce5d82007ca42a83","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Raitt","original_name":"Bonnie Raitt","popularity":0.3848,"profile_path":"/lN2PD7LGsltMmZj03DpaVrd7gYJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63decf218741c400c7f1d6a9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3906117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzio Marchello","original_name":"Enzio Marchello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63decbc18741c40099b42dad","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle Esrick","original_name":"Michelle Esrick","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe475fc3a36847f813206f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerry Stein","original_name":"Jerry Stein","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef0e84c3a3681f8b00893a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":944538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel B.
