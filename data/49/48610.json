A photograph from her wedding day is on her wall. A pesky and persistent moth bangs about the kitchen. She shoos it outside, turns off the porch light, and returns to her baking. The moth finds its way back into the kitchen, she bats it with a wooden spoon, and it falls into the mix. She stirs it up, pours the batter into a pan, and pops it into the oven. But the moth isn't done: it has a different mission, turning the oven into a portal, and inviting Bunny on a voyage of reunion.","popularity":0.9451,"poster_path":"/9CApdJg7tPwLMp2EJy7JudHWMYN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9383,"logo_path":"/ppeMh4iZJQUMm1nAjRALeNhWDfU.png","name":"Blue Sky Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bunny","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":62,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Nyuszkó","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bosmuend Pike","original_name":"Bosmuend Pike","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bunny (voice)","credit_id":"65a215b8238513012b624c9a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Wedge","original_name":"Chris Wedge","popularity":0.3225,"profile_path":"/bYiy2vcXgJq5XZdZ15uIhBhnBF8.jpg","credit_id":"52fe476dc3a36847f81350f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Wedge","original_name":"Chris Wedge","popularity":0.3225,"profile_path":"/bYiy2vcXgJq5XZdZ15uIhBhnBF8.jpg","credit_id":"52fe476dc3a36847f81350ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107706,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Rappaport","original_name":"Nina Rappaport","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a21555a6a4c1012ba44465","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097560,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fred Heid","original_name":"Fred Heid","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2168b297338012112c3f3","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Waits","original_name":"Tom Waits","popularity":0.3419,"profile_path":"/uxDkURjzHnaglIH2YRWUMJjoDx.jpg","credit_id":"65a2156f297338013012c3bc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749916,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leon Xiao","original_name":"Leon Xiao","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a215dfd35dea0126d49c73","department":"Production","job":"Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15768,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Nordquist","original_name":"Tim Nordquist","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2156049756001319af048","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4253815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacquire King","original_name":"Jacquire King","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a216575690b5012cafddbe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271259,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noëlle Penraat","original_name":"Noëlle Penraat","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a21695d35dea0129d49ce4","department":"Editing","job":"Negative Cutter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316216,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Goodrich","original_name":"Paul Goodrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a216312385130131624c78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":40144,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric A.
