He instructs him to take his ashes there and let Santoh immerse them. Surjit subsequently passes away, and Varyam travels to Punjab to fulfill his father's last wish. Upon arrival, he will soon start learning Punjabi from gorgeous Preet; running the village dispensary, as well as meet Santoh and Rani without informing them of his identity and intent. His intentions to make amends with them will be misunderstood as he will be expected to get married to Rani; while the local Police will be compelled to re-investigate the mysterious disappearance of a male named Kirpal.","popularity":0.454,"poster_path":"/9sLeecwxwHoq2bcTeX831ZkCq8M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mitti Wajaan Maardi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harbhajan Mann","original_name":"Harbhajan Mann","popularity":0.1736,"profile_path":"/fZ6YWH5gtN4qiNwlktfEtbQACIP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Varyam Singh","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f813474d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Japji Khaira","original_name":"Japji Khaira","popularity":0.3035,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Preet","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134751","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahie Gill","original_name":"Mahie Gill","popularity":0.3283,"profile_path":"/8BaceKKti0WFxa5PQLYLLhW684N.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rani","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134755","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deep Dhillon","original_name":"Deep Dhillon","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/s5FCe4ScuZ7l5npN6DyAG99GhUN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rani's uncle","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134759","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanwaljit Singh","original_name":"Kanwaljit Singh","popularity":0.3761,"profile_path":"/pitJUd0ySbOBrGOzLJBJ63fMLaK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Surjit Singh","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f813475d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurpreet Ghuggi","original_name":"Gurpreet Ghuggi","popularity":0.2614,"profile_path":"/7ZENS2dXJ4BU3Hg6dgJwtyvEGBm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ambarsari (as Gurpreet Ghuggi)","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134761","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rana Ranbir","original_name":"Rana Ranbir","popularity":0.2443,"profile_path":"/nrU97rU67R5U7Vmh114JczX1Klt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Pateliya","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134765","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivek Shauq","original_name":"Vivek Shauq","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/9nrjfrXMDeHJ8ulbqKZZ0imYIvd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Yogi","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134769","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manmohan Singh","original_name":"Manmohan Singh","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/nR1Xdff60tmwJwkfdhmrKAxv2tV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Baldev Gill","original_name":"Baldev Gill","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe476ac3a36847f8134749","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1579976","wikidata_id":"Q6883547","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wul6sIxRhJQDCMQyT1G1n1FY88g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":2258,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9sLeecwxwHoq2bcTeX831ZkCq8M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1573}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mitti Wajaan Maardi | Movie Trailer","key":"mxbqMyrVKn4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-01T13:11:50.000Z","id":"5e147ad4d8af670014c1a1c5"}]}}}
