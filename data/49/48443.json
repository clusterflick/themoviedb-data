From an upper door emerges an old man, dressed as a dandy, who tips his hat to the woman as he walks down stairs grinning. Others leave the same door and walk down the same stairs: a shabby man, a cop, and, several times, the same dandy. The man in blackface hangs himself; the dandy continues to smile. A bell tolls, a grave beckons. In the dark, the dandy plays the piano. Is he Death? The Hearts of Age is the first film made by Orson Welles. The film is an eight-minute short, which he co-directed with William Vance in 1934. The film stars Welles' first wife, Virginia Nicholson, as well as Welles himself. He made the film while attending the Todd School for Boys, in Woodstock, Illinois, at the age of 19.","popularity":0.4606,"poster_path":"/iAEQXHR6ewsfypxe19aoyPQVFb0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hearts of Age","video":false,"vote_average":5.338,"vote_count":37,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Corazones del tiempo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Oi kardies tis ilikias","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Death","credit_id":"558c13b4c3a3687e56003ff5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Vance","original_name":"William Vance","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Indian in Blanket","credit_id":"56c456c59251416ba7002005","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgerton Paul","original_name":"Edgerton Paul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bell-Ringer in Blackface (as Paul Edgerton)","credit_id":"56c456d29251416bb3001c82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Nicolson","original_name":"Virginia Nicolson","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/2ueSBjPiACl391U9R42tgsW6iTz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Keystone Cop","credit_id":"6155181de18b97002c3dd7b9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4766c3a36847f8133895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Vance","original_name":"William Vance","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c4570b9251416bac001d90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Vance","original_name":"William Vance","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e790549cabfe40013256ade","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Welles","original_name":"Orson Welles","popularity":1.2078,"profile_path":"/e9lGmqQq3EsHeUQgQLByo275hcc.jpg","credit_id":"5e790536c8a2d4001522cdb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Vance","original_name":"William Vance","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e790552cabfe400182469d6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025227","wikidata_id":"Q3008506","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jawzt9iNwZ4cSTHQNsP6qjcytGm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iAEQXHR6ewsfypxe19aoyPQVFb0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mSLqsmJsVvODsd7BHNIhOHIDr63.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":643},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u2Y4jr4anX4No5bnwk7ELoMjAHa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Athens Film Festival","release_date":"2011-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival","release_date":"1999-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
