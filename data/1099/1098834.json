Prokofiev's monumental setting of Leo N. Tolstoy's epic novel, War and Peace. The composer and his wife Mira compressed the plot, set during Napoleon's Russian campaign, into a powerful sequence of scenes in which the love story between Natasha Rostova and Andrei Bolkonsky and the description of the Russian army's fight against the French invasion alternate in rich contrast, and at the same time are closely interwoven. All is related by the music in its fullness of splendid themes and touchingly quiet moments. Prokofiev's musical-dramatic masterpiece combines social drama and historical chronicle in its 13 scenes to form an exuberant panorama. In this production by Dmitri Tcherniakov, the opera is performed in in Munich for the first time ever.","popularity":0.1148,"poster_path":"/lYiRwDoOXWxxMoYcnRadO3oGffT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":71879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel
